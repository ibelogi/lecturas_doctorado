Itbegan life as a\\ncontribution to adebatewithin the branchof geography known as\\n\\'industrial locationtheory\\'- as what I hopedwould be a trenchant\\ncritique of all, or prettymuch all, thathad gone before, together\\nwith a second halfwhich would present \\'analternative approach\\' . A\\nnumberof things have happened in the period since then. I got\\nbored with the critique. The second \\'hairbecame the length of a\\nbookin itself, and it also changed itsnature.Frombeing a\\nschematic outline it became increasingly grounded in what was\\ngoing on in Britain and in otheradvanced capitalist countries.\\nBut more thananything else I became increasingly convinced of\\ntheimportance ofthe issues involved and of the fact thatthey\\nshould have a wider audience. My basic aim had been to link the\\ngeography ofindustry andemployment to the wider, and under\\xad\\nlying,structures of society. And one of the things I do in the bookis\\npresentanapproach which,Ihope, makes thatpossible. The initial\\nintention, inotherwords, was to startfrom the characteristics of\\neconomy and society, and proceed to explain their geography . But\\nthe more I got involved in the subject, the more it seemed thatthe\\nprocess was not justone way.Itis also the case - I would argue \\xad\\nthatunderstanding geographical organisation isfundamental to\\nunderstanding an economy and a society. The geography of a\\nsociety makes a difference to the way it works.\\nIf this istrue analytically,it isalso true politically. Forthere to be\\nany hope ofaltering thefundamentally unequal geography of\\nBritish economy and society (and thatofothercapitalist coun\\xad\\ntries, too), a politics is necessary which links questions of geogra\\xad\\nphicaldistribution to those of social and economic organisation .\\nEffectivelyto confront the spatial inequality in Britain today means\\ntakingon much the same battles - and much the same social strata\\xad\\nas isnecessary to win any wider progressive change. But it isequally\\ntruethatany wider national politicalstrategymust be sensitive to\\nthevariations in economic structure, inoccupations , in political\\ntradition and in the fabric of day-to-day life which exist between\\ndifferent partsof thecountry.\\nx Preface xi\\nI have had a lot ofhelp and supportduringtheproduction ofthis\\nbook. Mostofthebookwas written while I was the SSRC Fellow in\\nIndustrial Location Research, and I shouldlike tothanktheSSRC\\nand its staff. The development of the ideas and arguments has been\\naided and stimulated by many friends and colleagues over a number\\nof years.Itwould be impossible to mention everyone by name.\\nWhathas been best abouttheprocess has been the gradual\\ndevelopment ofa practice which at least tries to argue without\\nscoringpoints,and to criticise by being constructive .Fortheir help,\\nparticularly in the final stages, however, I shouldlike tothank\\nMichael Ball and Huw Beynon, who read the manuscript, Nancy\\nMassey for typing it magnificently, and a numberoftimes,Richard\\nMeegan, my co-worker for many eventful years, and Ron Martin.\\nFacultyofSocial Sciences\\nThe Open University\\nMilton Keynes, EnglandDOREEN MASSEY Preface to the Second Edition\\nWhen the idea ofa second editionofSpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwas first suggested to me, some time ago, I was reluctant initially to\\ntake it up. Above all I was unsureofthe form which it shouldtake.\\nThe first editionofthebookwasstimulated inpartbyempirical\\nchanges, by thegreatshifts which began to take place in regional\\n(i.e.sub-national) economic and social geographies in the first\\nworld,fromaboutthe middle years ofthe 1960s. Such changes\\nwereimportant - they affected the lives ofpeople in cities and\\nregions across large partsofthe world. But the message I wantedto\\ndrawfrom those changes was most importantly theoretical. The\\nidea was to communicate a wayofunderstanding uneven geographi\\xad\\ncal development, ratherthantoadvance aninterpretation ofthe\\nshapeofthe world at some particular moment. Thelatterwas\\nimportant too but it was, as much as anything, a vehicle for a more\\ngeneral message. The arguments concerned, above all, the way in\\nwhich we conceptualise economic and to some extentmoregeneral\\nsocial space, abouthow we understand the differences andstruc\\xad\\nturesofinequality within it, and abouthow we might begin to think\\noftheeconomic identities of unique places.\\nThese issues, it seems to me, remainimportant. Muchofthe\\nargument ofSpatialDivisions ofLabourhas been widely accepted\\namonggeographers . But there remain ambiguities and(as they seem\\nto me!)misunderstandings. Moreover, since the time of the first\\neditionthere has been wide-ranging debate,discussion, notto say\\ncontroversy, inpartsparkedby thebookitself, in partoriginating\\nelsewhere butwithinwhich the bookhasnevertheless become\\nembroiled. As Ann Markusen and Ron Martinpointout in their\\nrecentassessments of thebookanditscareer(Progress inHuman\\nGeography, 1993),some ofits waysofarguingforeshadowed issues\\nonly now emerging more broadlyon to the agendaofintellectual\\ndebate.Theyare,moreover, issues which go way beyond the\\ndiscipline ofgeography to engage with currents ofargument \\xad\\naboutspatiality, location and place, aboutuniqueness, contingency\\nand modes oftheorising - nowpreoccupying a wide range ofthe\\nhumansciences.\\nXll Preface Xlll\\nIttherefore seemedappropriate for a second editionto be focused\\non these debates,and on an exploration ofthetheoretical argument\\nof the book in the contextofsomeofthediscussions ofwhich over\\nthe last decade ithas been partand in the light ofsubsequent\\ntheoretical developments . The body ofthebook,fromChapter 2 to\\nthe original \\'Postscript\\', therefore remainsunchanged except for the\\ncorrection ofsomeminortypographical errors.However, boththe\\nfirst and last chapters ofthiseditionare new and,as well as\\nconsidering recentchanges in thenatureandformofuneven\\ndevelopment, mostcentrally take on this task ofmakingmore\\nexplicit the key theoretical arguments andmethodological stances\\nof thebookand of setting them in the contextofwidercurrent\\ndebate.The new first chapterreassesses the purposeandbroadform\\nof thebookand pulls out the issues which are mostimportant and\\nwhich have become foci ofsubsequent debate. The new last chapter\\nprovides adetailed commentary on the text underthesemajor\\nheadings. It ishopedthatthis will clarify some ofthebook\\'s\\npositions andintentions and set them in a wider context, thatin\\nparticular it will make the bookmore helpful for teaching purposes\\n(bytracingthreadsofargument as theyappear- astheoretical\\nstatement or inconcrete use - indifferent partsofthebook),and\\nthatitwillprovoke yetfurtherdiscussion on issues which remain of\\ncentralimportance .\\nIshould like to thankmypublisher StevenKennedy forgoading\\nme into this, and for his continued advice and cheerful encourage\\xad\\nment. Ishouldalso like to thankJohnAllen, Allan Cochrane and\\nAndrew Sayer for helpful comments and much discussion . In the\\nten years since I wrote the first editionofSpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nI have been working at the Open University . It is a place which has\\naperhapsuniqueandcertainly verycollaborative andcooperative\\nwayofworking. My colleagues there, most particularly in Geo\\xad\\ngraphy,have been a constant source of new ideas and of intellectual\\nstimulation, and I am grateful forthat.Ishouldfurtherlike to\\nthankDoreenWarwick and Margaret Charters, alsoofthe Open\\nUniversity, for typing the material for this second edition.\\nDOREEN MASSEY ListofTables\\n4.1Changes in the sectoral distribution of employers and\\nself-employed within services, between 1961and 1975 171\\n4.2Self-employment as apercentage oftotalsectoral\\nemployment, by region, in 1975 173\\n4.3Thepercentage of UK research establishments in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, 1968 182\\n4.4Employment-based location quotients for office\\noccupations, 1971(England and Wales) 186\\n5.1Industrial jobscreatedin Wales, 1977 197\\n5.2Economic activity rates in industrial southWales and\\nGreatBritain 203\\n5.3 Age-specific activity rates for men, 1971: a\\ncomparison between regions 205\\n5.4Workers living in Rhondda in 1966 but working\\nelsewhere 215\\n6.1Someemployment characteristics of the\\nmodernisation period 242\\n6.2 Some employment characteristics ofthe mid-1970s 248\\nA.I Class composition and class self-image ofmining and\\nresortareas, 1970 (in percentages) 365\\nA.2Partisan self-image by class in mining areas and\\nresorts,1970 (in percentages) 365\\nxiv ListofFigures\\n2.1 A basic framework\\n3.1Managerial hierarchies andrelations ofownership\\nand possession: a basic shape\\n3.2The division oflabourinproduction inpartsof\\nelectronics\\n3.3Threelocations showing three different spatial\\nstructures\\n3.4 Three different part-process possibilities\\n3.5Occupations, relations and social classes\\n5.1 The acclimatisation oflabour\\n5.2 . . . and the acclimatisation ofmanagement\\n6.1 The role of regional policy in the National Plan\\n6.2Competition between areas\\nxv30\\n70\\n71\\n75\\n76\\n107\\n207-8\\n209\\n238-9\\n252 ListofAbbreviations\\nAUEW\\nBLMC\\nBSC\\nCBI\\ncOP\\nCIDA\\nCPSA\\nCSO\\nDEA\\nEAG\\nEC\\nECSC\\nEDC\\nEEC\\nESRC\\nHMSO\\nIDC\\nILAG\\nIMF\\nIRC\\nLOB\\nMP\\nNALGO\\nNCB\\nNEB\\nNEDO\\nNUFLAT\\nNUGMW\\nNUM\\nNUTGW\\nOECDAmalgamated UnionofEngineering Workers\\nBritish Leyland MotorCorporation\\nBritish Steel Corporation\\nConfederation ofBritishIndustry\\nCommunity Development Project\\nCornwall Industrial Development Association\\nCivil and Public Services Association\\nCentralStatistical Office\\nDepartment ofEconomic Affairs\\nEconomists Advisory Group\\nEuropean Community\\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community\\nEconomic Development Council\\nEuropean Economic Community\\nEconomic and Social Research Council\\nHerMajesty\\'sStationery Office\\nIndustrial Development Certificate\\nInquiryintoLocation Attitudes Group\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\nIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation\\nLocation ofOffices Bureau\\nMember ofParliament\\nNational Association ofLocalGovernment\\nOfficers\\nNational Coal Board\\nNational Enterprise Board\\nNational Economic Development Office\\nNational UnionofFootwear, Leatherand\\nAlliedTrades\\nNational UnionofGeneralandMunicipal\\nWorkers\\nNational UnionofMineworkers\\nNational UnionofTailorsandGarment\\nWorkers\\nOrganisation ofEconomic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment\\nxvi PBR\\nREP\\nROSE\\nSET\\nSICSSRC\\nTGWU\\nTUCListofAbbreviations xvii\\nPayment By Results\\nRegional Employment Premium\\nRestofSouthEast\\nSelective Employment Tax\\nStandard Industrial Classification\\nSocial Science Research Council\\nTransport andGeneral Workers\\' Union\\nTradesUnionCongress 1\\nThe Issues\\nThis is a bookaboutindustrialgeography andeconomic uneven\\ndevelopment. Itexplores themechanisms ofindustrial location, the\\nchanging formoftheinequalitiesbetween citiesandregions,andthe\\nimportance ofthesethingsto theeconomy andsocietymorewidely.\\nThisformsitsempirical focus.However, itbecameclearas I was\\nexploring these issues thatwhatweneededaboveall was a new way\\nofthinking abouteconomic space. We need, or so I arguein this\\nbook,tothinkofeconomic space as the productofthedifferen\\xad\\ntiatedandintersecting socialrelations oftheeconomy . It is with this\\nwayofconceptualising economic spacethatmuchofthebookis\\nconcerned . Such an approach influences the way we analysethe\\nlocation ofeconomic activity, the way we understand uneven\\ndevelopment, the way we conceptualise individual \\'areas(placesj,\\nandtheapproach wemaytaketoany.attempt totacklethe\\ninequality -therelations ofdominance andsubordinat ion\\xad\\ncurrently inherent inallthesethings. Let me begin, then, with the.\\ncentralnubofthisargument.\\nTo saythatsocialspaceisrelational hasbecomecommonplace .\\nButthingsaremoreeasily said thanfullyunderstood orthought\\nthrough intopractice.Tosaythatspaceisrelational meansboth\\nthatitshouldnotbeconceptualised as someabsolute (thatis to say,\\npre-existing) dimension andalsothatit isactually constructed out\\nof,is aproduct of, therelations between socialphenomena. We\\nactivelycreatespace (time -space,time-spaces) in theorganisation\\nandlivingoflife.IMoreover the way in which we do so will have its\\nimpactbackuponthestructuring ofsocietyandofourlives.\\nNow,inspiteofall thedebatethattherehas been overthe last\\ndecade, it is my feeling that- evenwithingeography, thatmost\\n\\'spatial\\'ofdisciplines, andcertainly withinindustrial geography \\xad\\nthis real meaning ofthesloganthat\\'space is relational\\' hasnot\\nbeentakenonboard.Uneven development -perhaps thecentral\\nconceptofeconomic geography\\'s fieldofenquiry - is still most\\nfrequently discussed as if it were onlyamatterofmoredevelopment 2SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nin some places than others; morejobs/investment /income here than\\nthere.Implicit in this is a notionofeconomic spaceas an\\nundulating surface, with successful high-points and less fortunate\\nlows. The argument \\'hereisthatspace can be more helpfully\\nconceptualised as theproductofthestretched-out, intersecting\\nandarticulating socialrelations of theeconomy. Notonly does this\\nintegrate \\'thesocial\\' and \\'thespatial\\'from the moment ofinitial\\nconceptualisation , it alsointroduces - directly into space itself - the\\nissueofsocial power.\\nTakea veryconcrete example. In the UnitedKingdom in the\\nearly 1990s the newspapers were full oftalkofthe collapse ofthe\\neconomy ofthesouth-east of thecountry. Equivalent debates\\nexisted in otherfirst world countries . This recession was different\\nfromprevious ones. Every week redundancies wereannounced in\\nsectors which in the previous decadehad been booming, whose\\nemployees (at least the upperechelon ones) had struttedthecountry\\nwith aself-confidence whichenraged those in otherareas(\\'the\\nnorth\\',Liverpool . . .) where the eighties economic razzamatazz\\ntooklonger to reach and was anyway fitful. The message from the\\nmedia in the early nineties was thatallthatwas over. Unemploy\\xad\\nment in the south-east was no longer even the lowest in the country,\\nthe gap between levels ofunemployment in \\'north\\' and \\'south\\'had\\nnarrowed. Mostcommentary, bothtabloidand seriously considered\\n(andincluding someacademic) ,announced afundamental change\\nin the regional geography ofthecountry.\\nSuch aninterpretation was gravely misconceived (which is not to\\ndenythattheeconomic situation in thesouth-east haddeteriorated\\ndramatically , nor to deny us northerners some grim satisfaction\\nthatthingsshouldbe so). But to try to interpret economic space\\nthroughthedistribution ofunemployment numbers (or tointerpret\\nany space simply through distributions ofsuchphenomena) is to\\nunderestimate thecomplexity of social space; most particularly it is\\nto evade readingitrelationally.\\nTo begin at the most obvious level, this interpretation does not\\ntake into account, forinstance, thequality,interestand above all\\nthepowerinherent in the very different kindsofjobsdone by those\\nwho were still in work in the different regionsofthecountry. A\\nglance at the statistics revealed yawning contrasts .Itwas thesouth,\\nespecially the south-east, which had the bulk ofthequalityjobs.\\nYet even this elaboration is still to look at distributions , to\\nconsider thespatialas anarrayoffree-floating objects - in this case The Issues 3\\njobs. (Somanymanagers here,scientists there,manual workers\\nthere.) But, I wanttoargue,whatconstruct economic spacesas\\nrelational arethesocialrelations onwhichthoseobjects/jobs\\nthemselves depend,andwhich link themtogether (ornot)intheir\\nmutualconstitution . So the existence ofvariation inkindsofjobs\\nbearswitness to thegeography ofthesocialrelations ofthe\\neconomy .Andin the light ofthatgeography thesouth-east was\\nstill in a positionofstructural dominance incomparison with,and\\nin relation to, otherregionsofthecountry. It was(andstill is) the\\nprimelocusofcontrol, ofstrategic planning, offinance,ofthe\\nresources forresearch andinnovation; it was(andstill is) the crucial\\n(andmostpolitically validated) hingein therelation between the\\nUKeconomy andtheworldeconomy .Thisisnotthesamethingas\\nsayingthatitsunemployment ratewas low or thateveryone in it\\nhada classyjob.Whatisbeingarguedisthatthis way oflookingat\\nthings,asspatialised socialrelations , is likely to lead to more\\ninteresting questions andmoreenlightening enquiry.Thisis a\\ngeography, notofjobsbutofpowerrelations, ofdominance and\\nsubordination, ofenablement andinfluence, andofsymbols and\\nsignification. Andit is ageography whichmatters,whichhas effects\\nbothon thepeopleofthedifferent regionsandon theeconomic and\\nsocialtrajectory ofthecountry.i\\nThisinsistence on theinterpretation ofeconomic geography in\\ntermsofthespatialorganisation oftherelations ofproduction\\n(defined in thewidestsenseofthatterm),asdistinct from the\\ngeographical distribution ofjobs, is thecentralcoreofthisbook. It\\nis,moreover , thesocio-economic aspectofamoregeneralargument\\n-thatspace(andthephenomena whichconstitute it) ismore\\nhelpfully conceptualised intermsofrelations, andspecifically\\npower-filled socialrelations, thansimplyaspatterns anddistribu\\xad\\ntionsofatomised objects.\\nThus, totakeupcentrally thesubject-matter ofthisbook,new\\nspatialdivisions oflabour(formsofeconomic unevendevelopment)\\narethorough re-workings ofthesocialrelations whichconstruct\\neconomic space(fordivisions oflabourthemselves areconceptua\\xad\\nlised asconstructed through socialrelations). Theyaremorethan\\njustnewpatterns ofemployment, akindofgeographical re\\xad\\nshuffling ofthesameoldpackofcards.Theyrepresent whole\\nnew sets ofrelations between activities indifferent places, new\\nspatialformsofsocialorganisation, newdimensions ofinequality\\nandnewrelations ofdominance anddependence .Eachnewspatial 4 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ndivisionoflabourrepresents a real, and thorough, spatialstructur\\xad\\ning. Itmarksa new form ofregionalproblem; and more basically it\\nmarksnot a new re-organisation ofrelations in space, butthe\\ncreationofa new space.\\nThe empirical focus and conceptual coreofthisbook,then,\\nconcerncertain(economic) aspects ofthat\\'impossible dichotomy\\'\\nthe social and the spatial.\\nHowever there are otherways, too, in which the booksetsouta\\ntheoretical position. Anumberofthese, while appreciated by some,\\nwere toprovoke amongothershowlsofpain, and much shock and\\nhorror. Above all, these issues turnedon myconcern with the\\nrelationship between \\'thegeneral\\' and\\'theparticular\\', the global\\nand the local(whichare notthe same as the general and the particular\\nthoughthey are frequently misunderstood to beso) and the attention\\ntoparticularity ,variability andcontingency. Over and over again in\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,particular \\'causalrelations\\' are seen as\\nenabling ratherthanasdeterminate in their effects,and forever liable\\nto bealteredin theirimplications, or even nullified, by othersetsof\\nrelations existing in the particularity oftheiroccurrence atthat\\nprecise point in time-space. The howls ofprotestcame mainly from\\nthose who detected too close a focus (for them) on contingency, on\\nvariation, on difference. Indeed on uniqueness.\\n***\\nThe first editionofthisbookwas written at a moment (the very\\nearly1980s)whichallowed it toreflectbackon themajor\\ntransformations which had been taking place since the sixties in\\ntheindustrial geography offirst world countries. Thosetransforma\\xad\\ntions form thecentralempirical focus ofenquiry, thelaboratory for\\nthereconceptualisation .Itwas also a moment whenconsiderable\\nmovement wasunderway inacademic studiesofindustrial geo\\xad\\ngraphy. In theUnitedKingdom at least, the approach through\\nneoclassical economics to modelling the locational behaviour of\\nindividual firms had been discredited. A \\'behavioural school\\'had\\nflourished for a while, to document the huge variety ofcompany\\xad\\norganisation then being recognised; but it failed to get much beyond\\ndocumentation .Throughout it all - and still today- a school of\\ncheery empiricism continued, based on censuses and surveys, and\\nunconcerned withattention totheoretical formulation orproblems\\nofconceptualisation. In 1976, the most comprehensive andauthor\\xad\\nitative review ofcurrentempirical changes reflected that: The Issues 5\\nThesevariousdeficiencies thus unfortunately nile outadoption of\\nany formal theoretical framework for this study. (Keeble, 1976,\\np.4)\\nIn response to this impasse new work had been developing , and\\nSpatialDivisionsofLabourwaspartofthatnewtrajectory. However ,\\nit had a specific bias and the beginnings ofacritique, which was of\\ncoursesubsequently tobecome muchmoregeneralised ,ofa\\nparticular formofrigid and economistic Marxism which had taken\\nsome hold in industrial studies and geography more widely.\\nThe original introduction put it thus:\\nThisbooktries tocontribute bothto some ofthesetheoretical\\nissues and debatesand to the interpretation ofwhat has been\\nhappening in the United Kingdom\\'s space-economy since the\\nearly sixties: its focus is on industrial geography . In spite ofthe\\nimpasse reached in traditional theorythere has continued to be a\\nrich vein of empirical anddescriptive work, some examining the\\ndevelopment ofindividual corporations , some, less satisfactorily ,\\njuggling with aggregate numbers andpatterns. But the period has\\nalso seen the gradualand often collective building ofaMarxist\\nschoolofthought. Forindustrial geography ispartofthe social\\nsciences and the alarming transformation ofitsobjectofstudy\\nwas not the only thing undermining itscredibility in the sixties\\nand seventies. Itwas also drawninto the revolution affecting\\nsocial sciences more generally. Itis within the second, Marxist,\\ntradition thatthis book lies. Itaims to set the changing geography\\nofindustry andemployment within the wider contextofthe\\ndevelopment ofcapitalist society and to examiaetheparticular\\ndevelopments inBritainthrough the prism oftheevolution of\\nclassandeconomic relations bothwithinthecountry and\\ninternationally . Specifically, it aims to explore the geography of\\nindustry andofjobsthrough aninterpretation ofthespatial\\norganisation ofthe social relations ofcapitalist production. Itwill\\nbe clear by the end ofthe book thatregional problems, and\\nspatialinequality more generally, have notbeenfundamentally\\nchallenged by anyoftheconsiderable varietyofpolitical strate\\xad\\ngies in force since the sixties, for none of them in the slightest\\ndegree challenged the underlying causeofthatuneven develop\\xad\\nment - the organisation ofproduction oncapitalist lines. 6 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nBut theMarxisttradition, like others, also has its variations\\nand itsinternaldebates. There are versions which look at the\\nworld as if it were merely the pre-determined productofa setof\\nlaws and tendencies. Such approaches leave little scope for real\\nconflict and struggle, still lessfor surprise and setback. They lead\\nalso to that same dichotomisation between formal models on the\\none hand and empirical description on theotherwhich plagued\\ntraditional industrial location theory. Like it, too, this version of\\nthe Marxist tradition has aproblemwithparticularity . Both have\\nan urge to normalise for the specificity of outcomes - and in\\ngeographical studies this can have majorrepercussions, for a\\nlargepartof what we are aboutisunderstanding unevenness,\\ndifference, place and locality. Finally, this version of Marxism\\ntends to be,thoughit is not necessarily, economistic .Forone\\nthing \\'the economic\\' level of society is so much easier to pin\\ndown, so much more amenable to thederivation ofabstractlong\\xad\\nruntendential developments .Andso, from the actionsof\\nmanagement to thepoliticsoftheState,explanations are\\nfrequently in terms solely of what is necessary for continued\\naccumulation.\\nTheapproach adoptedhere aims not to beinthattradition.It\\nadoptsa mode of explanation which tries to break with the\\ndichotomy between formal models and empirical description .It\\nrecognises underlying causal processes, but recognises, too, that\\nsuch processes never operatein isolation. Forit is precisely their\\noperation in varying combinations whichproduces variety and\\nuniqueness. Theparticular natureofcapitalism inspecific\\ncountries , the very different ways in which different partsofthe\\neconomy respond to the general situation ofeconomic recession,\\nthe very different impact which the entry of particular forms of\\neconomic activity can have on different regions and local areas:\\nall are\\'products ofmanydeterminations\\'. Insteadof trying to\\nnormalise for such differences , or to treatthem as merely\\ndeviations from a tendency, it is important to recognise their\\nexistence, to understand theirconstruction and toappreciate their\\neffects. British economy and society can only beunderstood by\\nrecognising its fundamentally capitalist nature. But it can only be\\nchanged - challenged politically - in its specific form. Both the\\ngeneral and the specific are essential, both to analysis and to\\naction. The Issues 7\\nThatbasicpositionstill holds good. Indeed it is appropriate, ten\\nyears on, to elaborate it.\\nFirstly, these arguments foreshadowed what was to become a\\nmuch wider debate,inpartwithinMarxism and over whetherand\\nhow some ofits basic insights could be re-thought orembedded in\\nwider fields oftheorising, inpartin the seemingly unproductive\\nclash between modernism andpostmodernism, and inpart,starting\\nearlier and proceeding more quietly, in the wealth oftheoretical\\ndebatewithin feminism. The relationship ofthebookto theselatter\\ndebates willbeconsidered in the concluding chapter;when the book\\nwas first written it was a productprimarily ofthe discussions going\\non within and aroundMarxism.\\nThefocusofSpatial Divisions ofLabour is onwhatis\\ntraditionally called\\'theeconomic \\'.Itis astudyofindustrial\\nlocation and ofthegeography ofoccupational and social struc\\xad\\nture. But the attemptis to beneithereconomistic nordeterministic .\\nItis argued thatthe study ofindustry andproduction is notjusta\\nmatterof\\'theeconomic\\', andthateconomic relations and\\nphenomena are themselves constructed within a wider field of\\nsocial, political and ideological relations. A real exploration of\\nindustrial geography takes one into historical shifts in national\\npolitics, into the vast variety ofsocial forms ofcapital,into the\\nwhole area ofgenderrelations and into many anotherwider field of\\nenquiry.\\nThe overall argument of this book is thatbehindmajorshifts\\nbetween dominant spatialdivisions oflabourwithin a countrylie\\nchanges in the spatialorganisation ofrelations ofproduction, the\\ndevelopment andreorganisation ofwhat are called here spatial\\nstructures ofproduction. Such shifts in spatialstructures are a\\nresponse to changes in class relations,economic andpolitical,\\nnational andinternational. Theirdevelopment is a social and\\nconflictual process; the geography ofindustry is anobjectof\\nstruggle.Theworldisnotsimplytheproduct ofcapital\\'s\\nrequirements .\\nSecondly, the arguments ofthebookrelate closely to thatother\\nconstellation ofdebates which has blossomed in recent years\\narounddifference, place and locality. Geography\\'s focus on place\\nand on uneven development represents its own particular way into\\nthe concern with difference and with identity which is now so\\nsalient in social sciences generally. 8Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAnd thirdly there is the related focus on the explanation of\\nuniqueness andvariability, not to the exclusion ofgeneralities but\\nas theircomplement. Thedebateon this issue has perhapsprovoked\\nmore heat than light, and has demonstrated the existence ofa\\ndisagreement between the partiesaboutthe very terms at issue\\nwhich has proved remarkably resistant toelucidation. Frommy\\npointofview, it seems thattheconcepts local,particular, and\\ncontingent (allofwhich are distinct in their meaning) remain widely\\nmisunderstood (as well as frequently conflated). The very mention\\nofcontingency still strikes fear into the heartsofthose who would\\nhavetheirworld more ordered, morepinned-down, thanthat.\\nThese issues will be explored in the final chapter, which will\\naddress some ofthe more recent debates thathavetakenplace, in\\npartprovoked bySpatial Divisions ofLabour, inpartofmore\\ngeneralprovenance .Signalling them now is to urge thatthe\\nintervening chapters be read as much for their conceptual appara\\xad\\ntus andarguments as for - if not more than for - their empirical\\nconclusions .\\n* * *\\nThefirstpartofthebook(Chapters 2and3)develops the\\ntheoretical framework. Chapter 2 deals with the most fundamental\\nstumbling-block ofall -conceptualisation. Ifwe really are to\\nunderstand spatialchangeas integral to social changeit is neces\\xad\\nsary to go back to some ofthe basics, to reconstruct someofthe\\nbuilding blocks. One obviousexample: this bookisaboutindustry,\\nbut how do we relate those easy labels used in industrial studies \\xad\\n\\'thecarindustry\\', \\'coal-mining \\',\\'theclothing sector\\'- toconcepts\\nofcapitalas a class, and more specifically to particular national\\ncapitalsas a class? Moregenerally Chapter 2 explores some ofthe\\nconnections betweenproduction and social structure beforeturning\\nto aconsideration oftherelationbetween these two and spatial\\nform. This latteris largely done in Chapter 3, which examines the\\n.rangeofvariation ofspatialstructures ofcapitalist production.\\nHere too the argument is forbetterconceptualisation - this time of\\nthegeography ofindustry itself.Towards the end, the chapterturns\\nfrom the analysis ofthegeographical organisation ofindustryto the\\nimpactonparticular places. Here the problemofconceptualisation\\nisthatofrecognising boththatparticular places are embedded in\\nwiderspatialstructures, arepartofbroader spatialdivisions of\\nlabour- a fact which they sharewithotherplaces - and thateach The Issues 9\\nlocality brings to thatsituation its own specifichistory and its own\\ncharacter .Onceagain the challenge isto hold on to both the general\\nmovement and the particularity ofcircumstance, and the final\\nsectionofthechapterelaborates elements of an approach by which\\nthis can be done.\\nThe purpose of all this reconceptualisation is to enable better\\nanalysis, understanding and action. The second partof the book\\nuses theapproach outlined in Chapters 2 and 3 to get to grips with\\nupheavals in the industrial geography of Britain between the sixties\\nand the eighties. It was a momentous period.Throughout, the\\nBritish economy was on the slide, and its international position\\nslumped. The post-war consensus was rejuvenated, refurbished and\\nthen thrown out. Class relations were remodelled and the social\\nstructure of thecountryunderwent a majorshift. The argument\\nhere is that the changing geography of the countrywas an integral\\nelement in all this.\\nChapter 4 begins by setting the broad scene, sketching in the\\nlonger-term contextof economic structure and class relations,\\nlooking at Britain both as a capitalist society and as a particular\\ncapitalist society.\\nFrom then on the analysis takes a numberofdifferent slices\\nthroughthe problem. The rest of Chapter4 uses the concepts of\\nspatialstructure to analyse the quite dramatic transformations in a\\nnumber of major sections of the economy. In the end the primary\\ninterest is in employment, and occupational and social structures \\xad\\nin spatial divisions of labour.Forthat reason, the focus here is on\\nlabour,on changes in the spatial structure of thelabourforce,\\nchanges in the use oflabourinproduction, andlabouras a\\ndeterminant , both as a \\'location factor\\' and as an active agent, of\\nindustry\\'s choice of location. Intensified economic pressures, in\\nvarious forms throughout the period, broughtwith them changes in\\nproduction process, shifts in the use of labour,attempts to search\\nout cheaper and lesscombative workers, and enormous reorganisa\\xad\\ntionsofgeographical form.\\nAll this had dramatic effects on particular places. In some the\\nprevious economic base was removed; in others it was substantially\\ntransformed . And just as the causes and shape ofindustrial change\\ndo not lie wholly within \\'the economic\\', so the impact of industrial\\nchange has far wider repercussions than simply the percentages\\nemployed in different industries, or not employed at all. Chapter5\\ntakes up this regional focus and looks at the kind of industrial 10SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nchange analysed in Chapter4, but from the point of view of some\\nof the places most affected by it. In particular thechapterexplores\\nthe major implications thatchanges in industrial geography had for\\nsocialstructure and gender relations in particular parts of the\\ncountry. Quite deliberately the chapterexamines these issues in the\\ncontext of two very different types of area, but areas which in the\\nsixties and seventies were on the receivingend of the same general\\nnational change - the decentralisation of jobs\\'forwomen\\' to\\nsmaller towns and peripheral regions.Whatthe analysis shows is\\nhow different the impact ofthis process was in the different regions.\\nIn spite of their being embedded in similar places in the new spatial\\nstructures ofproduction, the areas retained their differences, their\\ncharacters changed underthe impact of the same national process\\nand yet remained quite distinct. As in each of these chapters on\\nBritain, then, the analysis is not only concerned to produce a new\\nperspective on changes under way;it is also the vehiclefor a deeper\\ntheoretical argument.\\nInChapter 6 the political levelis examined more closely. From\\nWilson to Thatcher anumber of very different political and\\neconomic strategies were adopted in the UK. Chapter 6 argues\\nthateach of these strategies had very different geographical\\nrepercussions, each pushing forward differentially particular ele\\xad\\nments of the decline ofthe old spatial division of labourand the\\nemerging dominance ofthe new. The second halfof thechapter\\nassesses the state of play - the new geography ofclass in the early\\neighties.\\nChapter7, originally the Postscript to the first edition, picks up\\nfrom these issues of class and begins by emphasising the changing\\nnatureof regional inequality as it presented itselfin the early 1980s.\\nItis deeply to be regretted thatthesubsequent decade was to\\ndemonstrate beyonddoubtone of the theses emphasised in the\\nchapter,for if ever a decade exemplified the argument thatspatial\\n(or indeed other) inequality may be, not a productof differential\\ngrowth or decline, but integral to certaintypes of growth itself, it\\nwas the eighties. Today,in the mid-1990s thatpointhas still not\\nbeen made forcefully enough. Finally, the chapterreflects again\\nupon the politics ofchange and argues the need- emerging from all\\nthe previous theoretical and empirical argument - to address (and\\nchallenge) not spatialdistributions in themselves but the natureof\\nthe social relations which constitute them and this bothin termsof\\ntheir general character as capitalist and in terms oftheirparticular The Issues II\\nform in any given situation. With regard to the United Kingdom\\'It\\nalso means challenging the social power ofcertainstrata. . . in\\nparticular theupperechelons of white-collar hierarchies, manage\\xad\\nrial,professional and technical, and those who occupy and maintain\\nthe archaic structure ofthe British establishment in itsbroadest\\nsense\\' (p. 294). And, as has been argued throughout thebook, the\\ndifferential power relations of UK society are in partmaintained by\\ngeography - by the structuring ofsocial space.\\n* * *Finally, by way of introduction, are one or two definitions the\\nsignificance ofwhich may alreadyhavebecome apparent. By\\nindustryismeantall economic activity, all forms ofpaid employ\\xad\\nment. The term is notused only to refer to manufacturing; indeed a\\nlargeelementofChapter 5 revolves aroundaprimary sector\\nindustry (coal-mining) and a long section in Chapter 4 is specifi\\xad\\ncallyconcerned with service industries .Second, the term regiondoes\\nnot necessarily refer to standard regions, the majoradministrative\\ndivisions ofthecountry, but to any sub-national areaofany size.\\nOneofthearguments ofthe book is thatthe size,shapeand detail\\nof spatial variation andinequality in the UK underwent over the\\nperiod a thorough refashioning. Whatis more, this spatialchange\\nwas not justanoutcome ofeconomic restructuring and social\\nrecomposition; it was integral to both.The phases ofdevelopment\\nofspecific societies have particular geographical forms.Periodsof\\nmajoreconomic and social change are often also periodsofmajor\\nspatialchange. And it is one ofthecentralarguments ofthebook\\nthattheimportance ofacountry\\'s geography to its social and\\neconomic reproduction, andchange, has been for too long under\\xad\\nestimated. 2\\nSocialRelations andSpatial\\nOrganisation\\n2.1 The debate\\nKeeble\\'s assessment in the mid-1970s of the state, and particularly\\nof the empirical usefulness of industrial location theory was entirely\\ncorrect. Empirical enquiry into the geography of industry continued\\nbut in large partunencumbered by serious theoretical reflection or\\nattention to problems ofconceptualisation. One of the commonest\\nempirical methods was(andunfortunately still is) the simple\\nconfrontation oftwo maps, one representing cause, the other\\neffect. The effect, the phenomenon to be explained, might be a\\ngeographically-differentiated patternof employment change. The\\nmethodof establishing cause was to draw up the same map-outline\\nbut this time showing the geographical patternofareacharacter\\xad\\nistics (location factors) which werehypothesised to be influential in\\nproducing the distribution of employment growth or decline. The\\ndataon the two maps were then correlated and theproduction of a\\nset of significant coefficients was assumed effectively (after all the\\nusual caveats) to imply cause. The location factors in one map (the\\ncharacteristics of areas) were deemed to explain the patternof\\nemployment change in the other. More generally, and leaving aside\\nthe obvious \\'correlation-does-not-imply-cause \\' objections, geogra\\xad\\nphicalcharacteristics were taken to be a significant explanation of\\ngeographical d istributions.\\nThisapproach came under attackin the1970sfrom a number of\\ndirections. Most obviously, it was pointed out thatspatialpatterns\\nare not necessarily the result of spatial causes. Even a highly\\nsystematic spatial pattern,a clear geographical regularity, cannot\\nbe assumed to have a geographical cause. Such questions were\\nargued out over real issues. One of them concerned regional policy.\\nThe second half of the 1960shad witnessed a not inconsiderable\\nrelativedecentralisation ofproduction activities in Britain away\\nfrom the \\'central\\' regions of the south-east and midlands and\\n12 Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 13\\ntowards theperipheral regionsofthenorthandwest.The\\ndecentralisation coincided in time with a significant increase in\\nthestrength of regional policy. Regional policy at thatperiod\\nconsisted ofa setof\\'carrots and sticks\\' distributed aboutthe\\ncountry.Itwasdesigned tochangethegeography which an\\nindustrialist faced when makingalocation decision.Itwas, in\\notherwords, a spatialfactor, and it was soon claimed as the\\nprimary explanation for the changing spatialdistribution of\\nindustry; ageographical change in one thing producing a geogra\\xad\\nphical change in another.Itwas, however, pointedoutthatthere\\nmight be more to it than this. Perhapsthelocational requirements\\nofindustry hadaltered,as a result ofchanges in the process of\\nproduction .Without necessarily saying regional policy was irrele\\xad\\nvant,perhaps industry wasbeginning towanttodecentralise\\nanyway. Perhaps not all the cause ofgeographical change lay\\nwithingeography itself.I\\nAnother such issue concerned the inner cities. Therewascertainly\\na cleargeographical patternhere; some ofthe highest rates of\\ndeclineofmanufacturing employment in these years were in these\\ninnerurbanareas. So many geographers (and by no means only\\ngeographers) lookedto theinnercities,totheir\\'locational\\ncharacteristics\\', for the cause ofdecline.Itwas aspatialvariant\\non the general theme ofblaming the victim (the inner cities were\\ndeclining, so there must be something wrongwith them). There\\nwere two aspects to the rejection ofthis view. First,to the extent\\nthatthegeographical characteristics of the inner cities themselves\\nwereimportant it was still necessary to go behind the notionof\\nlocation factors and explain why those factors were important at\\nthat time. Locational requirements themselves are an outcome of\\nthecharacteristics andever-changing demands ofindustry. Second,\\nit waspointedoutthatdecline in the inner city might justhave\\nsomething to do with the more general state ofeconomic malaise,\\nthatinner cities were getting the worst of what was in any case a\\nbad deal. To the extent thatmanufacturing activity was shuttingup\\nshop in the face ofinternational recession and national decline the\\ncities might be suffering disproportionately, not as a result oftheir\\ncharacteristics aslocations, but because itwas in these areas that\\nwas to be found the oldest and generally least profitable production\\ncapacity. Theimplication ofboththese criticisms was that,instead\\nofpassingstraight from one spatialpatterntoanother, it was\\nnecessary to consider whyparticular location factors were impor- 14 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ntantatparticular periods(maybe the inner cities were suffering\\nbecause the demands ofindustry hadchanged) andto look at how\\nanindustrywasorganised over space (ratherthanjustseeing a two\\xad\\ndimensional surfaceofemployment). Whatboth implied, in other\\nwords, wasthatit wasimportant to step back a bit from the\\nimmediacy of the geographical question andanswer. In brief, it was\\nnecessary to look at production.\\nOfcourse, there was still the question ofwhat\\'looking at\\nproduction\\' was to mean. In the sense ofopening up the black\\nboxofthe firm even behaviourism could be said in some way to be\\ntakingmoreaccountofthe causes lying behind locational choices.\\nBut the more convincing answer was thatthe kinds oflocational\\ncharacteristics which will influence a company\\'s choiceofwhere to\\nbuild a new factory, expand,run down or close will dependon the\\nnatureanddemands ofthe process ofproduction. Inturn,changes\\ninproduction, andconsequently inlocationfactors, were arguedto\\nbe the result, not ofsomeautonomous choice by management , but\\nofwider economic and political forces, shop-floor relations within\\nthe firm, and ofthecompany\\'s reaction toboth. So, in the debate\\nover regional policy, the argument was not justthatchanges in\\nproduction were an important reason, often in conjunction with\\nregional policy,behindthegeographical decentralisation but,\\nfurther,thatthose changes were themselves often a reflection of\\nattempts to cope with a fast-changing widereconomic situation.\\nOneofthe main criticisms voiced ofthisapproach wasthatit was\\n\\'deterministic\\' .Therewas deep resistance to the idea thatwider\\nforces could be partofwhat influenced the actionsofindividual\\ncompanies, management teams, etc. It was a resistance bornnot\\nonlyofaconcern, ifill-conceptualised, for\\'individual freedom\\'r\\'\\nbut also from a fear thatthis would lead one outoftheterrainof\\nwhathadnormally beenconsidered \\'geographical\\' . We would have\\nto learn economics, maybe even sociology.\\nIn fact, the accusation was in general anyway misplaced. There\\nwas a clear insistence from the beginning that\\'macroeconomic\\nforces\\' did not automatically \\'produce\\' a response on the partof\\ncapital(see Massey and Meegan, 1979). But there was undoubtedly\\nan early tendency for analysis to lean in thatdirection withcapital\\nundifferent iatedly and mechanistically, and also often withoutany\\napparent trouble,responding to a setofforcesvariously called\\'the\\ndemands ofaccumulation\\' and\\'therequirements of the law of\\nvalue\\',whetherthese were conceived in terms ofabstractimmanent Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 15\\ntendencies ofthe mode ofproduction or in terms ofhistorically\\nspecified economic pressures. This was not only mechanistic, it was\\nalsoeconomistic . In fact, the way in which a firm copes with the\\npressures upon it depends on the kind ofcapitalinvolved, on the\\nkindoflabourwhich it faces, and on the battlebetween them. It\\nalso depends on how those pressures are defined and on how they\\naretranslated through the wider political and social context. The\\n\\'requirements\\' ofneitherthemacroeconomy northe lawofvalue\\nare sufficient to determine theoutcome.\\nProduction really is a social process and it is in thatsensethatits\\ndevelopment, including itsgeographical development, is not a\\nmechanistic outcome ofexternal forces. But thatis tochangethe\\ntermsofdebate. It is not only the personal idiosyncrasies of\\nmanagers which are at issue in the debateabout\\'determinism\\',\\nbut the fact thathistorical change comes aboutthrough social\\nprocesses and social conflict. The centralquestion is notwhether\\nmanagerial strategy, personality or skill is important: \\'Can Mac\\xad\\nGregorfVilliersfEdwardesfWeinstock makeadifference?\\' They\\ncertainly can, though only within the broader contextin which\\nthey are operating. Butindustrial location is not an issue to be\\naddressed solely in terms of managerial decision-making. Itis also\\npartand parcel ofthe much broader andcontinuing conflict\\nbetween capital and labour.Inthatsense this approach entails a\\nfardeeperrejection of\\'determinism\\'.Andanyway, to thinkbackto\\nthose empirical analyses based on correlation, what could be more\\ndeterministic than the search for a high R 2?\\nThe analysis ofproduction, and thence oflocation, must be set in\\nthecontextofbroadersocial processes, both inside and outsidethe\\nfinn itself. In ordertounderstand the causes and the significance of\\nlocation decisions - orofthegeographical distributionofan\\nindustry, the fortunes ofaparticular region, or the patternof\\ngeographical differentiation within a country as a whole - it is\\nnecessary to embed thatproblem within the broader contextof\\nwhatisgoingon in society in general. Thatmeansactually\\nconceptualising the firm, sectororwhatever is being analysed in\\nsuch a way thatit can be related to the broader structures of\\nsociety.Whatis at issue is the reproduction over space of social\\nrelations.\\nThe fact that the United Kingdom is acapitalist society means\\nthatthebroadformsofits social organisation are built aroundthe\\nclassrelations ofcapitalist production, between capitalon the one 16SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhandandlabouron theother.While it is capitalwhich essentially\\ncontrols theproduction process,bothin itsday-to-day functioning\\nandin thebroader processes ofallocation ofinvestment, the\\ndynamic ofthe system revolves aroundthecontradiction between\\nthese two classes. This is essential to all thatfollows.Itgovernsthe\\nstructure ofsociety, the organisation ofproduction and many ofthe\\nunquestioned assumptions ofdaily life. \\'Itis taken for granted,\"in\\nthe way things work\",thatprofitshouldbe thenormalyardstick of\\ninvestment in most areas ofactivity:thatthe living standards ofthe\\npropertyless majority shouldbe setprimarily by the terms on which\\nthey sell or once sold their labour. . . power is to be found more in\\nuneventful routinethaninconscious and active exercise ofwill\\'\\n(Westergaard and Resler, 1975, p. 144). But France, theUnited\\nStatesand the UnitedKingdom are alldominated bycapitalist\\nrelations ofproduction and yet there are enormous variations\\nbetween them. In Francethereis theinheritance ofa long\\xad\\nsurviving peasantry; in the United States a recent historywhich\\nhas included production underslaveownership. Neitherofthese\\nelements is present,or has played the same role in the social history\\nor the social structure ofthe United Kingdom .Noris it aquestion\\nmerelyof\\'additional\\' classes; the character ofeach class may vary\\ntoo. \\'Capital\\' in the UnitedKingdom isnotthe same as in the\\nUnitedStates. In each country too the hi storicalrelations within\\ncapital, such as between bankingandindustry, have been different.\\nIneachcase, in otherwords, thefundamental relations of\\ncapitalism developed historically underverydifferent conditions\\nand in each case, therefore , theytookondifferent forms. While an\\nabstract model of capitalism , byproviding the necessary concepts,\\nis an aid to analysis, it cannotsubstitute for the analysis itself. Each\\ncountry isdifferent ,andthesedifferences havegeographical\\nimplications .\\nIt follows also thatwithin each countrythings are more complex\\nthana simple confrontation betweencapitalandlabour.Thereare,\\nfor one thing, considerable variations within each ofthe twomajor\\nclasses.Intra-class, andnon-class division and conflict is important.\\nItinfluences the formation ofgovernment policy, it is reflected in\\nsocial and culturaldifferences between different partsofthecountry\\nand it has effects on location decisions and geographical patterns.\\nTotakeseriously \\'production as a social process\\' meansto\\ninvestigate therelation between these underlying structures and\\ntheirparticular empirical form, to investigate theactualcharacter- Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 17\\nisticsofcapitaland theparticular formofthe social relations ofthe\\nsociety it structures .\\nItis from here, then, thatwe shall start:lookingfirst at some of\\nthecharacteristics of \\'industry\\' and secondat the wider social\\nrelations ofwhichindustry is apart.On the way, the argument will\\nbroaden, reflecting bothsome more recent debatesand also my own\\ntheoretical position.Thereis a stress on the interconnections\\nbetween \\'the economic \\' andotherareas of life, a concern about\\nhow to use \\'laws ofthecapitalist modeofproduction \\' inempirical\\nanalysis, and an emphasis on the fact thatacapitalist society is far\\nmore than the capitalist modeofproduction . The section which\\nfollows those on industry and oncapitalist socialrelations picks up\\nagain the debateabouttherelation between the social and the\\nspatialandconcludes thatmaybe the arguments ofthe seventies\\nwere not quite correctafterall. Finally, an extended example, a\\nstudyillustrating and linking togethersomeoftherecurring themes,\\nconcludes thechapter.\\n2.2Characterising capital\\nThe problem\\n\\'Industry\\', then, is more thana collection of firms. Itis in general\\nterms the embodiment ofthecentralcapitalist socialrelation- the\\nexploitation oflabourinproduction. Butindustry is also highly\\ndifferentiated, andthese differences can be important. They can\\naffect political stance, investment strategyand locational decisions.\\nOnequestion, therefore , is: how can the structure ofcapital\\nownership be defined so thatlinks can be made between these\\ndifferent realms? How can the study oflocation, andofregional\\neconomic change, be made integral to a study ofUKcapitalist\\nsociety in general? Much depends onconceptualisation .\\nAlthough reservations areoftenexpressed, mostindustrial\\nlocation and regional employment studies have for long relied on\\ndividing the economy up bydistinguishing between \\'industries\\'.\\nThisapproach has,ofcourse, the supreme advantage ofbeing the\\nform in which the dataisavailable - the sectors oftheStandard\\nIndustrial Classification (SIC). On othercriteria,however, it suffers\\nfrom many problems . 18 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nSICOrder VI,MetalManufacture , provides a good example.\\nWithin this Orderare included both ofthe finer categories (mlhs)\\n311and 312(General Iron and Steel, and Steel Tubes) and mlh 313\\n(IronCastings). What they have in common is the fact thattheir\\nproduct is simple metal formed into basic shapes. Beyond that,\\nhowever, it is the differences between them which are striking. In\\nmuchoftheiron-castings industry production isorganised on the\\nbasisofshortruns and one-offjobs. Much ofit, too, is owned by\\n\\'smallcapital\\'.This is especially true ofthe craft foundries, which\\ntend to be single-plant firms, many employing less than a hundred\\nworkers, and quite a few of them less thanten. Incomplete\\ncontrast, the bulk of production in mlhs 311 and 312 is on a large\\nscale, with massive capitalrequirements, and under State owner\\xad\\nship. This is the British Steel Corporation. In terms both ofthe\\ntechnology ofproduction and of the kind ofcapitalinvolved, the\\ntwo are, therefore, very different.\\nSICOrder VII,Mechanical Engineering, includes both mlh 338\\n(OfficeMachinery) and mlh 332 (Metal Working Machine Tools).\\nOnce again these industries are very different from each otherin\\ntermsbothoflabourprocess and of capitalownership. The\\nproduction ofofficemachineryisrelatively automated and\\nroutinised , and is controlled by bigcapital,muchofit multi\\xad\\nnational. Incontrast, on these criteria,the machine tool industry\\nhas more in common with iron castings.\\nSICOrder IX,Electrical Engineering, includes a vast range of\\nindustries ,amongthem mlhs 361 (Electrical Machinery) , 366\\n(Electronic Computers) and 368 (Electric Appliances Primarily\\nForDomestic Use). All are predominantly owned by big capital\\n(indeed much ofit in the same companies) , but the difference in the\\nlabourprocess, for instance between 361and 366, is enormous.\\nFurther, mlhs361and 366 differ from 368 in terms of their place\\nwithin the overall structure of the economy. While the first two\\nindustries bothproduce commodities which are themselves means\\nofproduction, the third produces consumer goods.\\nThese differences matter.Characteristics of scale and ownership\\ncan influence a company\\'s response to changing macroeconomic\\nconditions, its relation to policy formulation and its ability to\\nrespondto policy initiatives, its degree oflocational flexibility and\\nitslocational requirements. Noris this a problem which can be\\nresolved simply by furtherdisaggregation along the lines of the SIC.\\nItis not the level ofdisaggregation which is in question but the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 19\\ncriteriathemselves. Significant linesofdifferentiation exist within\\nmlhs as well. Included in mlh 450 (Footwear) arebothahandfulof\\nlargemultinationals, oftenwithcontrol overtheirownretail\\noutlets, and a host ofextremely tiny firms run on an individual\\xad\\nproprietorsh ip basis.\\nSuch difficulties ofclassification andcharacterisation areof\\ncourse well known, and the changing structure oftheeconomy\\nhasbothmade the difficulties more evident andelicited a range of\\nresponses. Within industrial location studies, these responses have\\ntaken two main forms. On the one handa wealthofdetail has been\\nproduced , mainly by those working in abehavioural framework, on\\nthegreatvarietyofcompany type which exists. On the otherhand,\\nthere have been attempts toconstruct divisions oftheeconomy\\nbased on different, non-SIC, criteria.Both these approaches have\\nadvantages anddisadvantages. While it is important to recognise\\nvariety,recognition is notenough. With its essentially micro-level\\nandvoluntarist approach , thebehavioural school has failed to get\\nbeyond hopeful attempts ataggregation on the basis ofempirically\\nobserved similarities . Some form ofsystematisation andexplana\\xad\\ntion is necessary if the exercise is to go beyonddocumentation . It is\\nthis which is provided by the new dimensions ofdisaggregation\\nwhich have been suggested. Dimensions such as differences in\\nlabourprocess, or between \\'monopoly andnon-monopoly capital\\'\\nrepresent attempts to tie in these recognised empirical variations to\\nthe long-term development ofcapitalist economies . But, at least in\\nthe way they have been used so far, these approaches also have\\nproblems.\\nAnumberofdifferent linesofdivision, criteriaofdefinition , have\\nbeen suggested.\\nPlace in economic structure\\nOneofthe most frequently advocated ofthese is thatbased on\\n\\'placeineconomic structure\\'. Thismeansmorethansimply a\\ndescription oftheinputsandoutputsofaparticular economic\\nactivity.Itmeans aspecification ofthe way in which thateconomic\\nactivity relates, not justto its immediate marketandsuppliers, but\\nto thebroaderoverallstructure oftheeconomy. The most obvious\\nsuch division, and one which is particularly important in theUnited\\nKingdom, isthatbetween banking capitalandindustrial capital.\\nWithinindustrial capitalthere is a similarmajorstructural division 20 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbetween those partswhichproduce meansofproduction (often\\ncalledDepartment I) and those which produceconsumption goods\\n(Department II). Therelationofaparticular economic activity to\\nthis kind ofdivision has a numberofeffects. It determines how the\\nactivityfits into the reproduction oftheeconomy as a whole and it\\nmaytherefore influence, forinstance, theimpactofchanging\\nmacroeconomic conditions . It is acommonplace to see the banking\\nsectorbooming whileindustry slumps, or for capitalandconsumer\\xad\\ngoodsproduction to be growing at different rates. State policies\\ntowardsthe economy can often also reflect these divisions. Much of\\nthe State interestin andencouragement ofelectronic capitalgoods\\nin the late 1960swas a result ofthe factthatsuchproduction was\\nvital to increasing productivity inotherpartsoftheeconomy.\\nConversely, place in economic structure may influence the kind of\\neconomic policy a company wants to see from the State.\\nIn general terms, then, \\'place in economic structure\\' may be an\\nimportant determinant of the kind ofwiderpressures with which\\nany activity is faced. In their work on the inter-war andpost-war\\nperiod,Carney,Lewis and Hudson(1977)providea good example\\nofhow division along such lines can be used to analyse the\\nrelationship between macroeconomic developments andspatial\\nstructure. Theypointto thebroaddivision at thatperiod between\\nexpanding \\'Department II\\'production and astagnating \\'Depart\\xad\\nmentI\\'and relate thatto thelocational changes going on at the\\nsame time, with the bulk ofDepartment II being located in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, while the declining Department I was\\nconcentrated in thenorth. The causes ofthe shift in balance\\nbetween these two partsofthe economy were to be found in\\nchanges in the international economy and in particular in the\\ndeclineofBritain as an imperial economic power. Its effects were\\ncontradictory . On the one handtheDepartment IIindustries in the\\nsouthof thecountryneededexpanding markets, but because ofthe\\ndecline in the norththemarketthere was depressed. In this sense\\nthefortunes ofDepartment I were a constraint on thegrowth\\xad\\npotential ofDepartment II, and decline in the northon the\\nexpansion ofthesouth.On theotherhand, thebooming industries\\nofthesouthbenefited from the collapse to their north,for it was\\nthatwhichguaranteed acontinuing supplyoflabour. The\\nunemployed in thenorth,and their migration south,kept wages\\ndown and profitsup in the growing Department II industries. This\\nsituation in turn influenced the political stances takenbydifferent Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 21\\ngroupsofindustrialists, including theirattitude toStateregional\\npolicies.Carney, Lewis and Hudsonarguethat,for theindustries of\\nthesouth,thepotential ofthenorthas amarket wasmore\\nimportant thantheimpactofits decline in providing areserveof\\ncheaplabour. Thismeantthat,eventhoughtheywouldnot gain\\ndirectlyintermsoftheirownproduction locations, thecapitalists of\\nDepartment II in the southwerenevertheless infavourofattempts\\ntorevitalise thedepressed areasofthenorth. On the otherhand,\\nthis same concern fortheirmarkets onoccasion led theindustri\\xad\\nalistsofDepartment II intodirectconflict withthoseinDepart\\xad\\nmentI - the coal -owners weresometimes attacked, forinstance, as\\nbeingtoobrutalintheirwage-cutting (Carney, LewisandHudson,\\n1977,p.60).\\nAdivisionoftheeconomy intoDepartments istherefore both\\nimportant anduseful. One thingitimmediately bringshomeis the\\nrelationbetween economic structure ,spatialform,andnational and\\ninternational economic change. But on its ownthiswayof\\ncharacterising industry isinsufficient forourpurposes .First,as a\\nspecification evenofplace in the economic structure , it willusually\\nbe toobroadto bemeaningful. In thestudymentioned above,for\\ninstance, references to\\'Departments IandII\\'didnotactually mean\\nthewholeofthoseDepartments .Strictlyspeaking, therefore, the\\ntermswereinadequate definitions oftheindustries to which they\\ndidrefer. Astheauthors themselvespointout,therewere\\nDepartment Iindustries alsoenjoying very fast ratesofgrowthat\\nthisperiod.Moreover, andconversely, notallDepartment II\\nproduction, byanymeans,fellintothecategory ofnewgrowth\\nindustries .Notallconsumer goodscameoutofmodern factories\\nsheltering the new techniques ofproduction andlocatedon the\\nmajorroadsoutofLondon, or in the west midlands. Equallypart\\nofDepartment IIbutotherwise incomplete contrast were the\\ntraditional wage-good industries -industries such asfootwear and\\nhosierymanufacture .Although many; evenofthese, did consider\\xad\\nablyincrease bothoutputandproductivity overthisperiod\\n(Pollard, 1969, pp. 107-10), therewas no majorrevolution in\\nproduction technique toparallel thenewlabourprocesses in\\nmotor-car production, forinstance.Andinsteadofbrashand\\nrisingmultinationals, theseindustries were still dominated by old\\xad\\nfashioned family firms. Insteadofgreenfield sites in the outer\\nmetropolitan areaofthesouth-east, theyhadseen acenturyor\\nmoreoflocation inthesmalltownsoftheeastmidlands. 22SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nCompletely different presentcharacteristics , inotherwords, derived\\nfromcompletely different histories.\\nReference to Departments alone, then, is often too broadto\\nallowmeaningful analysis (seealso Courlet, 1977)and insensitive to\\nsuch kinds ofsocial-historical differentiation .\\nWhile the criterion of\\'placeineconomic structure\\' isimportant\\nindetermining the kind ofpressures and stimuli from the external\\neconomic environment which are faced by any particular plant, it is\\nlesssignificant in thedetermination oflocation strategy. The fact\\nthatthecapitalandconsumer-goods industries in theinter-war\\nyears were locatedindifferent regions was not due simply to the\\nfactthatthey were different Departments oftheeconomy. Clearly\\nthere may be a greaterdegree of orientation to the final consumer\\ninDepartment II,butthis is only one factoramongmany. And\\nthereis nosuchdirectlocational determinant attaching to\\nDepartment I.\\'Placeineconomic structure\\' does not ofitself have\\nmuch necessary relationtolocation. One way in which the link to\\nlocation can be made is through consideration ofthelabour\\nprocess.\\nContrasts in labour process\\nThehistorical shift incapitalist societies from one majortypeof\\nlabourprocess to anotherhas anumberofpotential geographical\\nimplications. A shift in labourprocess may involve changes in the\\nnatureand degree ofthe division oflabour,in thenumberof\\nworkers required for any given level of output, and in the kinds of\\nskills and othercharacteristics requiredofthoseworkers.Thereare\\nvariouswaysofcharacterising and periodising the development of\\nthelabourprocessincapitalist societies. In industrial location\\nstudies, whichfrequently follow the work ofAglietta (1979), four\\nphases are usually identified. The first, manufacture, consistsmainly\\nofthegathering togetherofpreviously independent workersinto a\\nfactory system. In the second,machinofacture, mechanisation is\\nintroduced and the division oflabourwithinproduction developed.\\nWithscientific management andFordism job-fragmentation is\\nfurtherincreased ,particularly alongthe lines ofseparation of\\nconception fromexecution, and the \\'flow-line\\' principle,aiding\\nthesechanges, isintroduced. in the latest phase, with the introduc\\xad\\ntionofneo-Fordisrn, fragmentation andde-skilling ofthedirect\\nworkforce (particularly through the removal ofcontrol) can be Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 23\\npushedfurtherwith the use ofelectronic information systems. Each\\nphase represents a different wayofcombining capitalandlabourin\\ntheproduction process, a different wayoforganising thelabour\\nforce, and a different kindofstratification anddifferentiation\\nwithinthatlabourforce.\\nForall these reasons, the natureofthelabourprocess can have\\nanimportant influence on location. Perrons\\' (1981)study ofIreland\\nprovides an example. She argues thateachofthe phases in the\\ndevelopment ofthelabourprocess has different implications both\\nfor theorganisation ofplantsinparticular industries and for their\\ngeographical distribution . Inbroadterms, she argues thateach\\nphase represents an increasing division oflabourbothfunctionally\\nand spatially. These locational implications are not simply logical\\nderivations . Theactualgeographical patternadopted for aparti\\xad\\ncularlabourprocess in a particular country willdependon the\\ninteraction between the requirements ofthelabourprocess and the\\ngeographical surface inherited from the pr-vious history ofthe\\ncountry. ForBritain, Perrons arguesthattheeai.ieststage \\xad\\nmanufacturing - tended to be widely dispersed throughout the\\ncountryside , the bulk ofitorganised intofactories, but with\\nhomework ing stillcontinuing to beimportant. The reason for this\\ngeographical distribution isstatedasbeing\\'toavoidguild\\nrestrictions and higher cost labourin the towns and also to obtain\\naccess to water power\\' (p. 90).Thispatternofdispersion was\\nreversed with the adventofmachinofacture. Here the use of\\nmechanical principles andpowermeansthattheconstraints\\nimposed by craft traditions are largely overcome andindustry\\nthereby freed from rural locations . This,Perronsargues,together\\nwith the need for highly developed infrastructure meantthat\\nproduction came increasingly to be concentrated in towns. In the\\nnextphasethegrowthofindustries dominated byscientific\\nmanagement andFordism saw the beginnings ofthespatial\\nseparation ofcontrolandproduction, and thegrowthofmarketing\\nactivities, the latterresulting from the expansion ofconsumer-goods\\nproduction. Together, these led to the growthofoffice-based\\nactivities and, it is argued, these replaced industry incentral-city\\nlocations, the restructured industry movingoutto thesuburbs, and\\nsubsequently, in the search for cheaperand lessorganised workers,\\nbeyondsuburbia to theperipheral regionsbothofthe home country\\nandofthe world. Finally, the adventofneo-Fordism in many ways\\nreinforces thisgeographical pattern byincreasing thespatial 24 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nseparability ofdifferent partsof theproduction process, and by\\nextending the possibility ofdecentralisation ofproduction to small\\xad\\nbatchprocesses as well as large assembly runs.\\nItmay be, then, thatthedifferent stages in the development of\\nthecapitalist labourprocess do have distinctgeographical implica\\xad\\ntions.Certainly , there is some relation between the organisation of\\nproduction andlocational requirements and degrees oflocational\\nflexibility. This does not mean, ofcourse,thatthere is a complete\\nreshaping ofalllocational patterns immediately a new type of\\nlabourprocessappearson the scene. At any given pointinhistorya\\nnumber ofdifferent labourprocesses willcoexist; it is this\\ncoexistence whichenables \\'labour process\\' to be a basis for\\ndisaggregating theeconomy, forcharacterising different partsof\\ncapital.Itis themajorcriterion operated byPerrons, whogroups\\ntogether sectors of the Irish economy on the basis of their being\\ndominated by distinct majorphases of the development ofthe\\nlabourprocess.\\nUnderstanding thenatureofthelabourprocess can help to make\\nthe link between changes in the broadpatternofaccumulation and\\nchanges in location. At the most general level,the emergence ofnew\\ntypesoflabourprocess reflects majorphases of capitalist develop\\xad\\nment, and in turn may be reflected in spatialchange. The advantage\\nofthisapproach isthatit enables the host ofdifferent technologies ,\\nandtheirassociated labourrequirements, to be seen in a broader\\ncontext.Itrelates them, and the changes which take place within\\nthem, to longer-term developments intrinsic to the relationwithin\\ntheproduction process between capitalandlabour.\\nOnce again, however, it is inadequate on its own. The growthof\\noffice-based activities, which is seen as a majorcause of industrial\\ndecentralisation, was due in partto thecompletely different fact\\nthatthe newindustries wereconsumer-based. Place in the economy,\\ninotherwords, was equally important. This being so there seems no\\nreason to elevate the labourprocess alone to pre-eminent theore\\xad\\nticalpriority.Itis, anyway, not \"labourprocess\\'whichdetermines\\nlocation, but the search after profitand the fluctuating conflict\\nbetween capitalandlabour.All kinds offactors may influence the\\nrelationbetweenlabourprocess and location.Similar processes may\\nbeoperated by verydifferent groupsofworkers. Similar assembly\\nprocesses, for example, are in some industries done by men, in\\nothersby women, in yet othersbyparticular racialgroups.The\\nlabourdemand for alabourprocess is determined not by the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 25\\nprocess itself but by a whole host of wider social and ideological\\ntraditions. Again, scientific management andFordism onlymake\\nspatialseparation ofcontrolandproduction possible. They do not,\\noutsideofparticular circumstances, determine thatit willhappen.\\nSeparation withinproduction doesnotinitselfgive rise to\\ngeographical separation. Simply to classify by labourprocesses is\\nnot to take account ofthehistorical conditions in which they\\nemerge.Forthatreason the actualway in which the criterion of\\nlabourprocess is used in the definition ofmajordivisions within the\\neconomy must be an empirical question. It must be a partof,rather\\nthan the single inputto, any analysis. But the real problem in using\\nlabourprocess as the main line ofdivide within the economy, the\\nmain way ofcharacterising partsofindustry, lies elsewhere. If the\\nobject of the exercise is to establish therelationship between wider\\neconomic and political changes and geographical change, then the\\nconceptualisation ofthe economy must be relevant to thatwhole\\nspectrum ofconcerns. While \\'labourprocess\\'does have some, very\\nbroadrelationtolocation, it is not clear thatin itself it has much\\nconnection with acompany\\'s relationto the wider socio-economic\\nand political structure .\\nAs with \\'place in economic structure\\' it is unlikely thatthe\\ncriterionoflabourprocess willbe meaningful on its own. Indeed,it\\nwill frequently be the case thatdivisions established on the basis of\\nlabourprocess will be closely related to divisions on othercriteria.\\nCourlet(1977), for instance, relates difference in labourprocess to\\nplace in economic structure. There is also, even more obviously, a\\nconnection to theorganisational structure ofcapital.Theadoption\\nofparticular labourprocesses is often governed by size ofcompany\\n(making multi-plant organisation possible, for instance), financial\\nresources (making possible the necessary investment) andmanage\\xad\\nment type, as well as the stateofplay between management and\\nlabour.\\nThe organisational structure ofcapital\\nIt is, indeed, organisational structure which has probably been the\\nfocusofmost recent enquiryingeography. Thedebateover external\\ncontrol, theproblems of\\'branch-plant economies \\', the desire to\\nstimulate indigenous growthwithinparticular areas, the political\\nsignificance of\\'small firms\\', have all ensured thattheorganisational\\nstructure ofcompanies has been a focus of attention. Whatexactly 26 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nhas been meantby the term has varied from study to study.\\nSometimes it has been considerations such asintersectoral spread,\\nmethodof finance, degree and type of internationalisation . Such\\ncharacteristics areimportant determinants of a firm\\'s political and\\neconomic, as wellas specifically locational, rangeofoptions. \\'Size\\',\\nand its associated characteristics, isprobably thedifferentiating\\nvariable on which most attention has focused, whether the distinc\\xad\\ntion has been between reflections of sizesuch as single-plant versus\\nmulti-plant firms or between \\'small capital\\'and\\'monopoly capital\\'.\\nOnce again, none ofthesecharacteristics evolve out of the blue.\\nThey are relatedtolong-term developments withincapitalist\\neconomies. The processes of concentrat ion andcentralisation are\\ntoo well known to need elaboration. Whatisimportant from the\\npointofview of the argument here isthatthey represent an\\naccretion into larger units of two aspects of production , two sets\\nof functions which stem from the fact of ownership. On the one\\nhand there is the power to allocate investment capital. This aspect\\nofownership is often called \\'economic ownership\\' . On the other\\nhand, there are the functions ofcontrolover theproduction process\\nas it exists - both the physical means of production and,through\\nthe supervisory structure,controloverlabour.To distinguish it\\nfrom economic ownership, this aspect of ownership is often called\\n\\'possession\\' . Theorganisation of the economy into larger units of\\ncapital, both through merger and takeover (centralisat ion) and\\nthroughinternalexpansion (concentration), represents an increase\\nof thecontrolby individual capitals over these functions. Centra\\xad\\nlisation represents agathering-in ofthesepowersunderthe\\ndirection of anindividual company, replacing their operation\\nthrough theunplanned relations ofthemarketby planned co\\xad\\nordination. This increasing co-ordination ofproduction under the\\nownership of large companies iswhat isat issuein debates over \\'the\\npowerofthe tophundred companies\\', and it has important spatial\\nconsequences. Itisthe extension ofcontrolby individual companies\\nover larger and larger partsof the overall relations of production .\\nBut \\'size\\', however it is measured, is not an adequate differ\\xad\\nentiator. One of the subthemes of this book is thatwhat is often\\nreferred to as \\'monopoly capital\\'is actually, from the point of view\\nof the locational issues examined here, highly differentiated. Apart\\nfrom the obvious broaddivisions - such as thatin Britain between\\nthe City and industry - there are also substantial differences\\nbetween industrial companies. There is perhaps a tendency in the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 27\\ngeographical andlocational literature to refer to the spatial\\nproclivities of\\'monopoly capital\\'asthoughit was an undiffer\\xad\\nentiatedentity.Eitherthepetrochemicals complex, or electronics,\\nor some ambiguous combination ofthe two, is takenasparadig\\xad\\nmaticofthe whole ofmonopoly capital.In fact, as is shown in\\nChapters 3, 4 and 6, different partsofbigcapitalcan have very\\ndifferent ways ofmakinguseofspatialvariation . Thesecontrasts ,\\nmoreover, canresultin very different formsofgeographical\\ninequality.\\nTheotherinadequacy ofsize as a differentiator is what might be\\ncalled the social natureofformsofownership. Thisis seen most\\nclearly in relation to small firms. Thereis a world ofdifference, in\\nalmost every aspect oftheiroperation, between the pushy and\\ndynamic entrepreneurial capitalto be found in some relatively new\\nsectorsoftheeconomy and the quiet ticking-over ofa family firm\\nin, say, one ofthe older consumer-goods industries mentioned\\nearlier. In the first case growth,expansion, andrisk-taking are the\\nnameofthegame.\\'In the second, the concernis with survival and\\nmaybe with succession. Indeed, the concernmay be explicitly with\\nthe survival ofaparticular social form, ofthe\\'familynature\\'of the\\nfirm, for instance. Accumulation in the classic sense is not the\\ncentralpreoccupation .Growth may even be avoided or feared\\nbecauseofthe riskthatit willchange the natureofthecompany, by\\nleadingperhaps to theintroduction ofamanagerial structure in\\nplaceofindividual owner/manager control,or to the possibility of\\ntakeover. Categories such as \\'small firm\\', in otherwords, may not\\nhave much analyticalmeaning. Ifproduction is a social process,\\nthen the social natureofcapitalisoffundamental importance when\\nit comes to characterising aparticular company. Descriptions based\\nonapparently objective (because quantitative or formal) measures\\nmay completely miss all the important differences.\\nSimilar kinds ofcontrasts may exist between much larger firms,\\ntoo. The difference between a wide-ranging multisectoral conglom\\xad\\nerateand asingle-industry company is not always justoneof\\nintersectoral spread. The whole orientation toproduction and to\\ninvestment opportunities maybedifferent. Manyconglomerates are\\ninvolved essentially in a financial mode ofoperation, commitment\\ntoparticular sectorsofproduction is minimal, and investment may\\nbe shifted rapidly and frequently between industries. Production in\\ngeneralisheresubordinated tomakinga financial profit.Clearly, in\\nacapitalist economy, production isalways basically for profitin the 28SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsensethatitcould not ultimately survive withoutprofits.Thatis the\\ncriterion by which production isjudgedto be, or not to be, worth\\nwhile. But there are many different social forms by which this\\nprocess can get played out. Whatthis in turn means, ofcourse,is\\nthatin discussing a particular economy, sector or firm, it is not\\nsufficient to refer to \\'therequirements ofaccumulation\\' to explain\\nmanagerial behaviour .\" Incontrast with the financially orientated\\nconglomerate , there is a sense in which long -established, single\\xad\\nindustry companies may well see themselves as being \\'in electrical\\nengineering\\', \\'inshirt-production \\', or what have you, as much as in\\nprofitsproduction (although ofcourse in fact they are in both,and\\nin the end the lattercontrols the former). The natureofthe\\ncalculation in these companies is different. The question is not:\\n\\'where(in what industry) areprofitshighest?\\', \\'whatshall we move\\ninto?\\',but:\\'whatis themarketforgenerators?\\', say, or \\'how many\\nshirts can we produceand sellat a profit?\\'Thesectorofproduction\\nis given.Itis notjustthatin thelattercase the company has no\\nintersectoral spread, butthatwiththatattitude,thatkindof\\ncalculation, it is not going to develop one. Antony Pilkington ,\\nchairofthemajorBritish glass manufacturers with his surname,\\nwasquotedin 1982as saying thathe and his board\\'havenever even\\nthoughthalfseriously ofmoving into anything otherthanglass and\\nalliedproducts\\' . Such a company will not, therefore, evaluate a\\ngiven rate ofprofitin\\'its\\'sector in the same way as might a\\nfinancially orientated, multi-industry conglomerate .\\n\\'Organisational structure\\' ,therefore , includes botha whole range\\nofpotentially measurable variables (none ofthem on their own will\\ndo)andmore \\'qualitative\\' social characteristics. Whatis often\\nthoughtofas the\\'economic\\' levelofsociety is itself formed and\\nshapedthrough socialprocesses, andeconomic behaviour is\\ninfluenced by wider social characteristics.\\nNeitherdoes this mean, however, thatit isenoughto fall back\\ninto the behavioural-school trapofendlessdescription. The aim\\nshouldbe to grasp these kinds of characteristics anddifferentiations\\nat asociallevel,andwith an eye to longer-term historical\\ndevelopments.\\nSome conclusions\\nAlloftheapproaches justdiscussed are attempts to dojustthat.\\nEach tries to link the characteristics ofindividual firms, or partsof Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 29\\ntheeconomy , to the stage ofdevelopment and the general char\\xad\\nacteristics oftheeconomy as a whole. Each also tries to link short\\xad\\ntermchangesto long.Changes bothin thelabourprocess and in the\\ndegreeofconcentration ofindustry actuallyhappenas a result of\\nthe day-to-daycompetition between companies. But these incre\\xad\\nmental and often hesitating processes result in identifiable long-term\\nshifts.Recognition ofthis dual natureisimportant. Itis what\\nenables the detail of specific empirical studies to be understood in\\ntermsofthebroadersweepofhistory. But none ofthesecriteriaon\\nits own is adequate . All are useful, all capturesomething , but all\\nseem tostraininordertogathereverything undertheir one rubric.\\nOrganisational structure , evenelaborated , will give little direct\\nguidance as to locational strategy-labourprocess may be more\\nuseful here. But labourprocess does not in itself providea basis for\\nestablishing arelationto theworkings ofthenational economy and\\npolitical structure . Some sensitive combination ofall three criteria\\nseems most likely to form the basis for a rethought sectionalisation\\nofthe economy. As we have seen, the three are closely linked. But\\nwhichcriterion is most important andhowthey are linked are\\nempirical questions. The answers will vary between countries and\\nover time. This is the heartofthematter.Above all, the three\\ncriteriadiscussed above have often failed to providemuch enlight\\xad\\nenmentinpractice because they have been used as externally\\xad\\nprovided ,aprioridivisions. Each is a serious attemptto link day\\xad\\nto-dayevents in industriallocation to thelonger-term historical\\ndevelopments ofcapitalism, but whathasoftenbeen crucially\\nmissed out in application is realhistory. They have been used in a\\nstaticand general way, as simple, logical derivations from a mode of\\nproduction, ratherthanas theproduct ofananalysis ofthe\\nparticular capitalist society being examined . As far as industrial\\nstudiesin the United Kingdom areconcerned ,whatwe need is a\\ndivisionofBritishcapitalwhich relates not only to the longer-term\\nhistorical development of\\'capitalism-the-mode-of-production\\' , but\\nto the long and specific historyofBritishcapitalism. Withinthat\\ncontext, the aim is to make links between politics, macro-economy\\nandlocation, and the initial conceptualisation oftheeconomy must\\nbepartofthe means by which those links are established . The basic\\nunitsofanalysis mustbemeaningful intermsofthecausal\\nstructure .Mostofwhatwe have to drawon in the United\\nKingdom covers one side but not the other.Thereare investiga\\xad\\ntionsofBritishcapitalas a class, which studyitsinternaldivisions 30SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nat anational and political level (for instance Gamble, 1981)but\\nwhich do not concern themselves much with changing regional\\nbalanceor with location. And there are, of course, numerous\\nlocational studies, but which fail to relate to British capital as a\\nreal historical classand its operation in the political sphere.The link\\nbetween the two has not been established in studies ofthe United\\nKingdom. One ofthe things industrial location studies clearly need\\nis abetterconceptualisation of\\'industry\\' itself.\\n2.3Socialstructures and capitalist relations ofproduction\\nAframework\\nBut what of the internal social structure ofcapitalist production?\\nFigure 2.1 presents a framework, borrowed from Wright, which\\nallows these relations to be examined and throughwhich connec\\xad\\ntionscan bemadebetween thesocia\\'relations ofcapitalist\\nproduction and the broader structure ofsociety.Itis also a\\nframework which enables links to be made from specific functions\\nBOURGEOISIE I---r----Small employers\\nTop managers ~\\nMiddleLanagersr~;~~_;i~R~:~~~J\\nBOUOml\\nmanagers /\\nISemi-autonomousemployees\\nForem~n and line./\\nsupervisors ~\\n[;R~Z~~A~;A~~\\nFIGURE2.1A basicframework\\nSource: adaptedfrom Wright (1976,chart 8). Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 31\\nwithin acapitalist society at any pointin time, and the social groups\\nwhoperform those functions, to long-term processes ofcapitalist\\ndevelopment. The basic building blocks of a capitalist society, the\\nbourgeoisie and the working class, form the main axis. Each of\\nthese two classes isdefined in relationto theotherand by its degree\\nofcontrolover the process ofproduction, its place in the relations\\nofproduction. Thebourgeoisie is defined by having botheconomic\\nownership and possession ofthe means of production - inother\\nwords,\\'capitalists\\' control theaccumulation process through\\ndecisions aboutinvestment, decide how the physical means of\\nproduction are to be used and controltheauthority-structure\\nwithin the labourprocess. The working class is characterised by\\nthe absence ofthese kinds ofcontrol, by its exclusion from both\\neconomic ownership and possession. These are the two fundamen\\xad\\ntal, and defining, classes ofacapitalist society. It is their mutually\\ndefiningrelationship which enables the one class to exploit the other\\nand to do so in a specifically capitalist fashion.\\n***\\nBut noactualcapitalist society,ofcourse, is so simple. Forone\\nthing,neitherofthe two majorclasses will be internally homo\\xad\\ngeneous. Within the working class there are, for instance, the lines\\nofdivision between skilled and unskilled which figure so promi\\xad\\nnently as a condition ofthe location patternsofindustry. At times\\nindustries may beeffectively rootedto aparticular locationby long,\\noftengenerations-long , experience amongst thearea\\'sworkingclass\\nofworking inthatsector. Changes in production which\\'free\\'an\\nindustry from this tie may free it not only in terms of the labour\\nmarketbut also geographically . The way the skilled and unskilled\\noperateas\\'location factors\\' may also be very different. In some\\ncircumstances, skilledworkersmay exert a pull simply on account\\nofavailability, while unskilled workers may have to compete by\\nbidding down their wages. One important factorbehind the recent\\nperipheralisation ofproduction in many industrialised capitalist\\ncountries (as well as internationally) is often arguedto be the\\nreleaseofindustry from ties to traditional labour,and its acquisi\\xad\\ntion thereby ofa newgeographical flexibility.\\nDifferences such as these within the labourforce (and therefore in\\nthe\\'spatialsurface\\'whichcapitalfaces) are in partderived from\\ndevelopments in thedivision oflabourandtherelations of\\nproduction . The general role oftechnical changeinengendering 32 Spatial DivisionsofLabour\\nthe emergence ofnew elements in the workforce is well recognised\\neven if its precise form is disputed. Changes in labourprocess and\\ntechnology areboththeoutcome of social relations and the basis\\nfor thecreation ofnew forms ofsuchrelations. At the most\\nimmediate level, technical change in the production ofparticular\\ngoods is partofthe process of capitalist competition, and it has at\\nleast two main kinds ofimpetus, on the one handto lower costs of\\nproduction and on the otherto increase the degree ofcontrolby\\nmanagement over the work process itself. The two aspects are\\ncloselyintertwined. Both, too, are long-term andgradually-evolving\\nprocesses, and have takenplace in different ways at different\\nperiodsofhistory. In the earliest days ofcapitalism theindividual\\ndirectproducers, especially those working incottageindustries,\\nretained a high degree ofcontrolover how fast, and for how long,\\ntheyworked. Oneofthereasons behindtheorganisation of\\nproduction into factories was the need on the partofthe owners\\nofcapitalto gain morecontrol over the production process\\n(Marglin, 1974).\\nOneofthe ways by which bothproductivity andmanagerial\\ncontrolhas been increased is throughthefurtherelaboration ofthe\\ndivisionoflabour: thedevelopment ofthe technical division of\\nlabourwithinproduction .Perhaps the most celebrated aspectof\\nthis has been the dual process ofseparating thefunctions of\\nconceptualisation from those of execution, andoftheincreasing\\nfragmentation ofthe tasks ofexecution. Itis this kind ofprocess\\nwhich is referred to in the term \\'deskilling\\', and the classic form can\\nbeschematised as thebreakdown ofa task, which previously\\ninvolved thinking thejobthrough, organising it andactually\\ncarrying it out, into two separate jobs: in one the task is set up\\nand in the otheractually performed . Thisdevelopment therefore\\ninvolves the creationofa whole hierarchy ofjobsdifferentiated\\nfrom each otheron anumberofdifferent dimensions . There is the\\ndimension fromconceptualisation to execution - from, for instance,\\ndesignengineering andpartsprogramming tomachine codingand\\nmachine operating in the setting up and working ofnumerically\\ncontrolled machine tools. There is the h ierarchy of degrees of\\nindividual jobcontrol. In some jobs, especially where the overall\\nwork process is based aroundautomatic machinery, there is very\\nlittle flexibility for the individual workerin the way the jobis timed,\\nperformed or generally organised . On the otherhandthere is also a\\nwhole range ofjobsincluding research work, varioustypes of SocialRelations andSpatialOrganisation 33\\ntechnical employment and skilled engineering jobs,which involve a\\nrelatively high degree ofautonomy inrelationto the work process\\non thepartoftheindividual employee.\" Norare skills and\\nautonomy equatable. Some relatively skilled jobsleave very little\\nroom for the individual workertoorganise the work process; some\\nvery unskilled jobsareprettymuchoutsidethedetailedminute-by\\xad\\nminutecontrolofbothmanagement andmachinery . These are by\\nno means the only ways in which the capitalist labourprocess\\nchanges over time. Norare such processes as dichotomisation and\\ndeskilling as linear and monotonic as issometimes made out.\" For\\none thing they may be resisted, for another technological change\\ncan beaccompanied by all kinds ofdifferent implications for the\\nconstitution oftasks within production . New skilled jobsmay be\\ncreated. And no task is entirelydevoidofnon-routine operations\\n(even if only because things go wrong, machines breakdown) or\\nmental activity. But these are processes which at varioustimes(and\\nplaces) have been important.\\nWhatissignificant aboutthem in this argument, as examples of\\nchanges in the process ofproduction, isthattheseparating outof\\ndifferent partsofthe overall work process can come to be mirrored\\nin aparallel setofsocialgroups, eachperforming different\\nfunctions. This is not, it shouldbepointed out,in any sense\\ntechnically necessary. Afterall, one skilled machinist used to do the\\njobnowperformed by thecombination ofpartsprogrammer,\\nmachine coderandmachine operator.\\nThe unity ofthis process in the handsofthe skilled machinist is\\nperfectly feasible, andindeed has much to recommend it, since\\nthe knowledge ofmetal-cutting practices which is required for\\nprogramming isalreadymastered by themachinist. Thusthere is\\nnoquestion thatfrom apractical standpoint there isnothingto\\nprevent themachining processundernumerical controlfrom\\nremaining theprovince ofthetotalcraftsman [sic].Thatthis\\nalmostneverhappens is due, of course, to theopportunities the\\nprocess offers for the destruction ofcraftand thecheapening of\\ntheresulting piecesoflaborinto which it is broken(Braverman,\\n1974,p.199).\\nThedifferent tasks are allocated todifferent typesofworkers.Inthe\\nUnitedStates,Braverman reports,thepartsprogrammer is increas\\xad\\ningly ajuniortechnical college graduate, themachine codera\\'girl\\',\\nand the operator a semi-skilled male. This hierarchy replaces the 34SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\noneco-ordinated function of skilled machinist. Italso reflects a lot\\nmore than simple \\'technical requirements\\' . The new arrayofjobs\\nnot only draws on existing differences within the workforce, but\\nalso helps to create and reinforce them. Changes in the organisation\\nof the social relations of production reflect and are reflected in\\nchanges in the structure of society as a whole.\\nSomedivisions within the working class, then, stem from\\ndifferences within production . But there are other divisions which\\nareconstructed as much outside as within the workplace. Race and\\ngender are the most obvious examples. In recent decades the\\n\\'economically active\\'workforce inBritainhas been greatly\\nextended to include large numbers of blacks and married women.\\nTheincorporation of such new groups into the paid workforce is\\noften enabled by the kinds of technological changes mentioned\\nabove - not necessarily because less-demanding jobsare created\\nwhich the newworkers can perform (as is often asserted), but often\\nsimply because the very decomposition andreorganisation of the\\nwork process enables the recruitment of a social group previously\\nexcluded, perhaps on ideological grounds. Theincorporation of\\nsuch new groups is often bound up with continuing antagonisms\\nanddemarcations within the division of labour- sexismand racism\\nare powerful divides within the working class.\\n***\\nIn mostcapitalist societies there are also classes otherthan capital\\nandlabour. Land ownership may be the basis for a distinct class,\\nfor instance; as can self-employment. Itis thelatter, because ofits\\ndirect relation to production, which immediately concerns us here.\\nBecause self-employment does not involve the exploitation of wage\\nlabourit is not strictly a capitalist form; it is involved in no\\nrelations, in the immediate production process, with labour. This\\nis the petty bourgeoisie of Figure 2 .1, defined as having economic\\nownership and possession of the physical means of production, but\\nas having no controlover the labourof others (since no labouris\\nemployed). Thereare many people in industrialised capitalist\\nsocieties who are self-employed simply in the sense that that\\nhappens to be the way their wages are paid. Itmay simply be a\\nway of avoiding employer obligations or taxes. The \\'lump\\'in the\\nconstruction industry is the most obvious example in the United\\nKingdom; sub-contracted homeworking isanother. Byself-employ\\xad\\nment we mean here to refer to real controlover aproduction Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 35\\nprocess.Itis real social relations ratherthanlegal forms which\\ngivemeaning to thegroupscharacterised byparticular labels.Inthis\\nstrictersense,self-employment, as aformofproduction, is a pre\\xad\\ncapitalist inheritance, but itscontinued reproduction, the factthat\\nnewareasofself-employment continue to growandflourish, means\\nthatin thiscategory, too, there is significant differentiation. Itis a\\nkindofdifferentiation which, in the UnitedKingdom , closely\\nparallels thatwithin small firms. One element iswhatmight be\\ncalled the classic traditional pettybourgeoisie. Itis typified by the\\nshopkeeper, anclementofthe social structure which is genuinely\\npre-capitalist in the sense thatitretainsafoothold in thosepartsof\\ntheeconomy wherecapitalist firms have not yet fully takenover.\\nForprecisely this reasonit is, inindustrialised capitalist societies, a\\ngrouptypically (though by nomeansalways) on the decline - the\\ncornershopunderthreatfrom the supermarket, self-employment\\npushedout bycompetition fromcapitalemploying wage-labour.In\\ncontrast, there are partsoftheeconomy in which self-employment is\\nexpanding , and where it is not, therefore, as a type, underthreat.\\nThe new professional andbusiness-service sectorsare anexample.\\nDecline and expansion are not the only differences between these\\nelements withinthecategory ofself-employment. Theirsocial\\ncharacteristics are also markedly different. Theself-employed in\\ntheprofessions andsimilarareastend to see theirjobsashigh-status\\nones.They are usually graduates, and in social terms may have little\\nincommon with the shopkeepers whosecompany , informalclass\\nterms, they are sometimes said to keep.\\nMoreover , within any actualcapitalist society there are also\\ngroups,oftenquitesubstantial , which do not fit neatlyandclearly\\ninto any of these unambiguous classdefinitions. Thecriteriaof\\ndefinition ofeachofthese three classes are neitherall-or-nothing\\ncharacteristics norstaticdescriptions. Classes are a product of\\nhistoryandofsocialconflictas well as being constituent ofthem.\\nTheirdefinitions are based on functions whose social organisation\\nchanges over time. Between classes, therefore, aredimensions of\\ntension representing realprocesses ofchangewithincapitalist\\nsociety.Takethe division between bourgeoisie andworking class.\\nTheformeris defined as having botheconomic ownership and\\npossession ofthe means ofproduction (i.e.controlbothover what\\nisproduced andover how it is produced), thelatterashaving\\nneither. Yet capitalist development has been characterised bothby a\\nseparation ofeconomic ownership frompossession (mirrored ,along 36SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwith the disjunction oflegalownership and real economic owner\\xad\\nship, in the debateon\\'theseparation ofownership fromcontrol\\')\\nand by the development ofcomplex hierarchies withineach.\\nRelations ofpossession concern theorganisation ofthecapitalist\\nproduction process. They involve controlbothover the physical\\nmeansofproduction and over labour. On the former, there have\\ndeveloped hierarchies ofmanagement from top managers control\\xad\\nling theproductive apparatus ofa wholecompany , tofunctionaries\\nat thebottomof the pile. On the latterthere have developed\\nhierarchies ofsupervision , from upper management to the fore\\xad\\nperson on the shop floor. With economic ownership a similar\\nhierarchy maystretchfrom the top executives who have full control\\nof the overall investment andaccumulation process (often as wellas\\nconsiderable legalownership), throughmanagers who have control\\noverinvestment only inindividual plantsorparticular functional\\ndivisions, to those lowest levels ofmanagement which mainly\\nadminister the decisions ofothers.Puttingall thistogether, there\\nis aspectrum within these \\'contradictory locations \\', asWrightcalls\\nthem,\" from top management with some, but not full, economic\\nownership alongside full participation inrelations of possession\\nthroughto, say, someone supervising justoneproduction line, and\\nhaving,therefore, noeconomic ownership , little if any controlover\\nthe physical apparatus ofproduction , and limited controlover\\notheremployees. Thereis inthatsense a spectrum from the\\nbourgeoisie (thepersonnel ofcapital)to theworking class.\\nThedimension betweenproletariat and petty bourgeoisie reflects\\nthe long process ofremovalofimmediate jobcontrolfrom direct\\nproducers. Itrelates to such processes as deskilling. There are a\\nnumberofelements here. There are skilled manualandcraftjobs\\nwhere the individual workerretains more flexibility in terms ofhow\\nthejobis done and even over exactly what is produced .Thereare\\nalsothosenewgroupsofemployees -scientists ,high-level\\ntechnicians and the like - whose jobsarecreatedincounterposition\\nto the deskilling ofothers, in the larger process oftheseparation of\\nconception from execution. These jobs,too,containelements of\\nindividual jobcontrol orautonomy .Wright(1978) gives the\\nexamples ofresearchers in laboratories , and university academics.\\nNeitherofthesejobsoften involves much controloverother\\npeople\\'s labour,yet each involves a reasonable degreeofcontrol\\nover the conditions andorganisation ofwork. Like self-employ\\xad\\nment, this is not simply a h istorically-residual category on a one- Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 37\\nwaypathtoelimination; it isconstantly beingaddedto by new and\\nratherdifferent elements.\\nFinally, the dimension between bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoi\\xad\\nsie. Both groups,ateitherendofthespectrum, have full economic\\nownership, andcontrolover the relations ofpossession .What\\ndistinguishes them is their relationto theexploitation oflabourand\\nthereby to accumulation. Thepetty-bourgeois ownerwill beboth\\nmoreinvolved indirectproduction andlessinvolved in the\\nemployment ofothersand in real accumulation, thanis the fully\\ncapitalist employer. But once again, there is a spectrum, reflecting\\nboththedying-out ofself-employment inindustries where fully\\ncapitalist relations ofproduction areestablished and thecontinual\\nregrowth ofself-employment inotherpartsoftheeconomy .\\nTheframework ,therefore, represents not astatictypology, ready\\nto be fitted on to a piece of the real world, but a set ofsocial\\nprocesses within which there is constant tensionand behind which\\nlie theconflicts ofacapitalist society. Thesedimensions of\\ncontradictory classlocations relatenotjustto the\\'aspatial\\'\\ndevelopment of the social relations ofacapitalist society, but also\\nto new forms ofspatialorganisation within such a society.\\nAt a very immediate level, each of these dimensions is reflected in\\ndebatesalreadygoing on, although in verydifferent terms,about\\nthegeographical organisation ofproduction. On thedimension of\\nrelations between bourgeoisie andproletariat lies the whole\\nspectrum ofmanagerial stratawhich has been the focus ofso\\nmuchoftheattention ofthebehavioural schoolofindustrial\\nlocation. Different kindsofspatialorganisation ofmanagement\\nhave been voluminously described. Study afterstudyhasexamined\\ntheimplications forlonger-termlocalgrowthofbranch-plant\\ndomination ofregional economies .Whatbothissues are really\\nconcerned with is the geographical organisation ofthedeveloping\\nsocialrelations ofproduction. Whatis at issue, andwhatis the key\\ntoformulating suchquestions systematically, is thespatial organi\\xad\\nsationofeconomic ownership and therelations ofpossession. The\\nempirical information gained in behavioural studiesofmanagement\\nstructure aboutactivities and personnel can bereconceptualised in\\ntermsofthefunction ofthe activities within the social relations of\\nproduction and the place ofthepersonnel within the wider social\\xad\\nclassstructure . Likewise, the dimension from pettybourgeoisie to\\nproletariat relates to aspects ofdeskilling and the dichotomisation\\nofthelabourforce. The much-studied RandDworkerswith their 38SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhighly-concentrated geographical distribution are also to he found\\nalongthisdimension .Note,too, apointwhich will become\\nimportant later:thatthere are different sourcesofthe \\'white-collar\\nmiddle class\\', some havingamanagerial role,othersajob,such as\\nresearch, with a high degree ofautonomy, andthatthesedifferent\\nfunctions imply also ratherdifferent classlocations. Finally,along\\nthedimension between pettybourgeoisie andbourgeoisie lie all the\\ndifferent kindsofsmall firms, differentiated bynumberofemploy\\xad\\nees, byattitudetoexpansion and by social character.\\n* **\\nTheargument here,then, isthatWright\\'s framework can be\\nextended . Both the broadrelations between classes and the very\\nconsiderable differences within them are fundamental inunder\\xad\\nstanding locational change, bothits causes and its wider effects.\\nBothwhatare called \\'interregional relations\\' andgeographical\\ndifferences in type ofemployment are in large partthespatial\\nexpression oftherelations ofproduction and the divisions oflabour\\nwithin society. Notonly is there a relationbetween developments\\nwithin the social relations ofproduction on the one handand social\\nstructure on theother,butthatrelationoccurs over space. The\\nchanging spatialorganisation oftherelationsofproduction and the\\ndivisionoflabouris a basis for understanding changing spatial\\npatterns ofemployment and thegeography ofsocial class. And the\\nchanging organisation offunctions within those evolving relations\\nofproduction is a basis for understanding changesin\\'interregional\\nrelations\\'. All this will be taken up in Chapter 3.\\nBut - once again - the framework inFigure2.1isonly a\\nframework .Itis a way intotheanalysis ofrealhistorical\\ndiversity. Quitewhat the characteristics andcomposition ofclasses\\nwill be in any particular country, and how thatwill berelatedto\\ngeographical patternsandstructures is anempirical question. What\\nmattersis not to superimpose a formal framework on the \\'real\\nworld\\'and expect the lattertoconform, or to be simply under\\xad\\nstandable when read throughanabstract and pre-given taxonomy .\\nThepointofaframework is toprovideanapproach to analysis of\\nthe real world, not to substitute for it. The remainder ofthis\\nchapter, and the next, develop theframework further, and in the\\nsecondpartofthebooktheapproach is used to investigate recent\\nchanges in therelation between social and spatialstructure in\\nBritain. Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 39\\nElaborations\\nAndmatters, anyway, arenotso simple. It is notpossible to\\nunderstand the wider characteristics ofsocialstructure simply by\\nexamining developments withinproduction. Forone thing, there\\nare many groupsin society which cannotbe\\'placed\\' socially in\\ntermsoftheir own immediate roles in the relations ofproduction.\\nMoresignificantly from the pointofviewoftheargument here,\\nthere is no determinate, one-way relationbetween a function within\\ntherelations ofproduction and the social groupwhichperforms it.\\nWhatwe have lookedat so far is really places andfunctions . But\\n\\'who\\'does aparticular jobis notdetermined by therelations of\\nproduction themselves, nor by\\'technology\\', butbyparticular\\nconjunctions ofthe economics oflabourmarkets andofsocial\\ntradition. Thereisevidence thatthestatusandtrendiness of some of\\nthe newly-emerging jobs\\'incomputers \\' is a result more ofthe fact\\nthat,in thepresentstateofthelabourmarket,graduates are usually\\nemployed to fill them, thanofany real requirements ofthe tasks\\nthemselves. Ideologies of race and gendercriss-cross thelabour\\nmarket,defining which groupscan do which jobs. How can one\\nsquaretheconstant, and usually unexamined, \\'argument\\' that\\'the\\nwork got lighter so enabling women to be employed\\' with the fact\\nthatin theThirdWorld it is women who do mostofthe heavy\\nlabour?Closed shops and demarcation rules have similareffects \\xad\\nconveyancing in house purchase canhardlybe said to requireskilled\\nworkers, but it is solicitors, at high fees, who do it.\\nTheconverse is alsotrue. The social statusofagroupof\\nemployees is not simply determined by the real contentofthejob\\ntheyarehiredto do.Allen(1977)writesof\\'ideologically\\ndetermined labourmarkets\\' and argues that\\'Thereis no task in\\nthe whole process of production , exchange and distribution which is\\nnotrankedaccording to its usefulness to the system in spite ofand\\noftencontrary to its own objective skill qualities\\' (p. 67). And\\ndifferences in ideological statusspill over into all aspects ofthejob,\\nandtherefore beyond. \\'Workers in highstatusjobstend to have\\nhigherearnings, shorterand more congenially-distributed working\\nhours,betterworking conditions , longerholidays and more social\\namenities in general than those in jobsrankedbelowthem\\'(p. 67).\\nNordoes the social definition ofajobas\\'skilled\\' necessarily have\\nmuch to do with the real contentof thelabourprocess. There\\ncertainly are real differences between different jobsin termsofthe 40SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nlevel of skill required. But an analysis, for instance, of tradeunion\\nagreements or the Census of Production skillcategories would not\\nnecessarily relate to these attributes. Whether or not a particular\\njobis classified as skilled can be as much a result oforganisational\\nstrength,bargaining power and ideology as ofthenatureofthe task\\nitself. The Coventry carindustry in the 1920s provides a good\\nexample. The ratioofskilled to semi-skilled workerswas far higher\\ntherethanin the car industry in the rest of England. This was not\\ndue to a difference in the production process, but to the fact that\\nmany semi-skilled workers (defined in terms oftheamountof\\ntraining needed for the jobthey were doing) managed to gain\\nskilledstatusinCoventry. \\'Tobe classified as skilled in Coventry\\'s\\ncarindustry came simply to distinguish thoseworkers who were\\nbeing paid the district skilled rate. Increasingly workers achieved\\nthis rate on account of their individual bargaining powerrather\\nthantheirskills\\'(Friedman, 1977,p.204). Themostfamous\\nexampleofthis kind ofbasis for skill-categorisation was thebattle\\nover\\'dilution\\' in theengineering industries in Britain in wartime. It\\nwas abattlecaused by the ease with which supposedly unskilled\\nworkers, particularly women, were able to take over the jobsof\\nsupposedly skilled male workers. Thedesignation as skilled, and\\nindeed the ability to hangon tothatdesignation in spiteofdilution,\\nwas clearly in large measure a resultofhistorical organisational and\\ninstitutional factors. Rubery (1978) concludes that\\'workers are\\nthus \\'skilled\\' and \\'unskilled\\' according towhether or notentryto\\ntheirorganisation isdeliberately restricted, and not in the first place\\naccording to thenatureoftheoccupation itself(p. 31). The very\\nfactthata job is done by women, whatever itscontent, is likely to\\nlower its status.Subordinate ethnicgroupsoften face the same\\nphenomenon. Here, then, the different lines ofargument come\\ntogether. Technology, the physical natureoftheproduction process\\nand the real contentoftasks are important influences on the nature\\noflabour-demand , on who does what joband on the social status\\naccorded to it, but they are not the whole explanation.\\nThiskindofconsideration can beimportant inlocational\\nanalysis. As was said earlier, changes in the labourprocess may\\nbeintroduced bymanagement for a variety ofreasons,amongthem\\nbeingattempts to increase controlover the production process and\\nto reduce its cost in money terms. The two are not the same. \\'Real\\ndeskilling\\' is likely to lead to both,to apotential increase in control\\n(in so far as this is a productofthelabourprocess itself) and to a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 41\\nreduction in wage costs. The fact thatit may not reduce costs\\nimmediately will be due to the ability ofestablished groupsof\\nworkers tohangon to their status. And one way capitalhasof\\nretaliating tothatkindofdefence of living standards on thepartof\\nworkers is simply to shift locationally, beyondthegeographical\\nboundsoftheworkerswith whom they are negotiating .Conversely,\\na sufficient degree ofalteration in thelabourprocess, even when it\\ninvolves no \\'real\\'deskilling at all, may enablethedowngrading ofa\\njobin formal, and therefore cost terms. A crucialelement in the\\nability to do this may well be a change in the workforce, from an\\nestablished one which had won the accreditation \\'skilled\\', to a new\\none with no negotiating basis inrelationto thisemployment. It is\\nsimply a move from a stronger (because established) to aweaker\\npartofthelabourmarket.And in turn an important element in\\nmakingthis shift may be locational change. This does not mean\\nthatthere are no differences in skill, no processes of deskilling. It\\ndoes mean, however, thatthe formal, official categories may refer\\nless to such attributes thantostrength, statusand wages, and that\\nto detect real changes in jobcontentthelabourprocess must be\\nexamined directly.Muchhas been made in recentyears, for\\ninstance, ofthe deskilling which seems to have enabledperipher\\xad\\nalisation (bothintra-and internationally) ofunitsofproduction.\\nCertainly in many cases these locational shiftswerepossible because\\nofachangein theproduction process which meantthata less\\nskilledlabourforce could be employed. In othercases,though, the\\nchange in production process freed capitalfromdependence on a\\ngroupofworkers who did the jobas a result oftradition rather\\nthan specific skill, thereby enabling achangeofworkforce and\\nlocation, eventhoughnoactualdeskilling was involved. The two\\nlines ofdistinction , between skill in relationtojobcontentand the\\nsocial labelling of skill, do not coincide. But bothare real. They\\nbothmarkimportant dimensions ofdifferentiation withinthe\\nworkforce . Similarly, to say thatanindustry islookingforcheap,\\nunskilled, female labouris an immensely loadedstatement. That\\n\\'demand\\' cannotbe taken to be simply a reflection of technology .\\nNor,therefore, can\\'locationfactors\\'be seen as simply the reflection\\nof therequirements ofthelabourprocess.Labourprocess is not in\\nthat sense determinant oflocation. In theseandmanyotherways,\\nthe link between production relations, socialstructure andlocation\\nis theproductof wider social factors as wellas ofthecharacteristics\\nof thejobitself.Itis notjusta one-way influence; the relative 42SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nweaknesses and strengths ofdifferent groupsin theworkforce can\\naffect the way the production process isevolved, to take advantage\\nofthe one and to avoid the other. To say, then, thatindustrial\\nlocationispartofwider social relations does not justmeanthatit is\\nset in a larger context. The wider social relations ofsociety also\\ninfluence the internalstructure ofproduction itself. Once again, the\\nideological and the economic are integral to the construction of\\neach other.\\nThis is still to talk in terms ofrelations ofproduction ,ofthe\\nfunctions within them, and of the groupswhichperform those\\nfunctions . Because a main theme ofthisbookarguesthatone of the\\nkeys to understanding thegeography ofemployment is the\\ngeography oftherelations ofproduction, this level will be an\\nimportant focus of attention . Butthatlevel of analysis is not\\nsufficient to define \\'classes\\' in any more full-blooded sense. As Hall\\n(1977)putsit,production relations indicate the sites ofclass\\nrelations in the economic structure, but those sites do not designate\\nwhole classes as integral, empirical groupsof men and women. The\\nfactthatpeople occupy similar places in the relations ofproduction\\ndoes not in itself imply any otherempirical level ofcoherence, still\\nless any kind ofnecessary political unity aboutpre-given common\\ninterests. Wright talks ofclasscapacities, the social relations within\\naclasswhichdetermine howinternally coherent it is. He\\ndistinguishes between structural capacities (thoseinternal links\\ngenerated bythedevelopments ofacapitalist society) and\\norganisational capacities (thoselinks which are a product of\\nconscious organisation). Skilled and unskilled workers, blacks and\\nwhites,whatever theirapparent common fundamental interests, are\\nfrequently pittedagainsteachotherin the immediacy of day-to-day\\nlife,and it isin actualstrugglethatpolitical subjects are constituted .\\nAllofwhich means, first, that\\'wholeclasses\\' are rarely actual\\npolitical subjects and, second, thatit is most frequently non-class\\nsubjects - blacks, women, taxpayers - who occupy the front ofthe\\npolitical stage.\\nWe have, therefore , come a long way from the classic conception\\nofindustrial location theory,in which an entrepreneur or a\\nmanager staresout at a \\'spatial surface\\' and makes a \\'location\\ndecision\\' in acontextdivorced from historyand social relations.\\nThe\\'industrial location decision\\' isjustonemoment in a much\\nwidereconomic, ideological and political field. But we have also\\ncome a long way from thatconception ofthe world which envisages Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 43\\na simple opposition betweencapitalandlabourin acontextwhere\\nthecategories and theimmanent tendencies ofthecapitalist mode\\nofproduction substitute for analysis ofrealhistory.\\nReflections\\nThreeelements ofthisjourneyare ofparticular importance for the\\nanalysis here.\\nThe first concerns therelationship between politics and ideology,\\nandthatrealm very generally and vaguely referred to as \\'the social\\',\\non the one hand, and\\'theeconomic\\' on theother.We have seen\\nthatpolitics and ideology are not to be interpreted as simple\\nreflections ofthe economic; thatwas clear in the discussion of\\nclass, for instance. But perhapsmoreimportant here, because the\\nfocusofthis book is, in the end, on the economic, is the obverse\\nimplication -thatpolitics and ideology are themselves important in\\ntheconstruction of theeconomic. Questions of who does which\\njobs,theproblem ofthedefinition ofskill, the identification of\\ndifferent kindsofcapital, all exemplify the fact thattheeconomic\\naspectsofsociety are themselves social constructions ,thoroughly\\nimbued with politics andideological tradition. Exactly parallel\\npointsare reflected at a wider level. Statepoliciescannotsimply\\nbeinterpreted in terms of\\'thedemands oftheeconomy\\'. Itis no\\nargument to saythat\\'accumulation required theimplementation of\\nregional policy\\',for instance. Forone thing, as we have seen, the\\nprocess is more complex thanthatanyway. Therearefrequently\\nhighlysignificant divisions andconflicts within\\'capital\\' and\\ntherefore in therequirements ofaccumulation .Ithastherefore to\\nbeanalysed as to how the ruling requirement isestablished as\\ngeneral.Moreimportantly, theeconomic development ofsociety is\\nitself subject to political determination. The stimuli and pressures of\\ninternational capitalism do not arrive raw at the factorygate. The\\norganisation ofthenational economy is itself an objectofpolitical\\nstruggle; different sectionsofthe ruling class seek to impose their\\nown, very different, political rationalities upon it. These rational\\xad\\nities are truly political; they cannotsimply be analysed as the\\nproductoftherequirements oftheeconomy. \\'Thismeansthatthe\\neconomy , like allotherspheresofsociety, is the terrainofa political\\nstruggle, and thatits \"laws ofmotion\" are not governed by a simple\\nlogic, but by the hegemonic articulation existing in a given society\\'\\n(LaclauandMouffe, 1981,p. 22). In Britain, for example, there is a 44 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nworldofdifference between the economic and social logic of\\ndifferent partsoftheStateandbetween different political\\nelements. Gamble (1981) has analysed some ofthesecontrasting\\npositions and their effects, pointing for instance to thatimportant,\\nand long dominant, strandwithin the British Conservative Partyfor\\nwhich the maintenance ofsocial power and relatively stable class\\nrelations has been of far greaterimportance thananyparticular\\n\\'bourgeois\\' economic ideology, such as thatof the free play of\\nmarketforces. There have been many times when the maintenance\\nofthehistorical termsofclass rule have not been simply consistent\\nwith \\'the interests of the British economy\\' .Butifthatis the case\\nthen, as Laclau and Mouffe argue, the political must be a primary\\ndefiningcharacteristic ofanyparticular conjuncture . Ifthatalso is\\nthe case then it must be as a function ofthatpolitics, set- obviously\\n- within the wider constraints ofeconomic conditions but not\\nsimplyrelaying themunmodified , and as a function ofthe\\nconstruction ofthatparticular political hegemony, thatthe role\\nandrationale of, forinstance, regional policy, must be interpreted.\\nThis does not mean, either, thatthe analysis is simply reversed \\xad\\nthat\\'thepolitical\\' level rules, un trammelled byotherconsidera\\xad\\ntions.Forpoliticalrationalities andinterpretations arerationalities\\naboutandinterpretations ofthe objective circumstances of the time,\\nchiefamongthem the requirements ofcapitalist production .\\n* * *The second element ofimportance isthatempirical analysis does\\nnot consist ofreferences to the \\'laws\\' ofcapitalist development, nor\\nisexplanation adequately established by a gesture in the direction of\\nsome \\'immanent tendency\\'. Forthis reason too, it is not possible to\\nexplaintheactionsofanindividual company ormanagement\\nsimply by referring to therequirements ofaccumulation . The\\nresponse of capitalto suchrequirements will depend on its own\\nsocialcharacteristics , the kinds ofcalculation which it makes, the\\nkindofworkforce with which it is faced and its actions,and on the\\ntermsofthebattlebetween them. If the management ofGEC,\\nBritish Steel or British Leyland engage in long struggles with the\\nworkforce over changes in the labourprocess and location, and if\\nthose changes broadlycoincide with the longer run ofdevelopments\\nundercapitalism, then it is important tounderstand that.Butit is\\nnone the lessinsufficient to refer to those tendencies in explanation .\\nWhat,then, of those cases where the long-run tendencies do not\\n\\'showup in the real world\\'?The same pointsapply to the analysis of Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 45\\nthespatialdevelopment ofcapitalist societies as a whole. Again\\nthere are no inexorable trendswhich can be broughtdownoffthe\\nshelf inexplanation when the results of empirical analysisappearto\\nconform with the theory.\\nThe most obviousexample withingeographical analysis has been\\ntheassertion of a necessary tendency to increasing spatialconcen\\xad\\ntration. Such a position has anapparent radicalism ,andis clearly\\noftenstimulated by adesiretocounter theconclusions of\\nequilibration atequality which emerge from neoclassical theory.\\nMarx himself is sometimes claimed to have identified aninevitable\\ntendency undercapitalism towards spatialconcentration, and\\ncertainly there are quotations which can be read to this effect.\\nThemostobvious sourceofsuchevidence isprobably the\\ndiscussion oftheturnover ofcapital,andparticularly ofthe time\\nofcirculation, this having evident relevance to the geographical\\ndimension. But it would be unfairto deduce from such quotations\\nthatMarxhad adeveloped position thatthedominant tendency\\nwithin the geographical development ofthecapitalist modeof\\nproduction wasthattowardscentralisation andinequality .Whathe\\ndid was to pointto anumberofdifferent - andcontradictory \\xad\\nforces to which the development ofcapitalism might give rise.\\nSomeattempts have been made morerecently, however, to\\nproduce a moresystematic analysis. While numerous writers refer\\nto\\'increasing spatialconcentration undercapitalism \\', fewargue the\\ncase in detail. The most thorough attemptis in the work ofLapple\\nand van Hoogstraten (Liipple, 1978; Lappleand van Hoogstraten ,\\n1979; and van Hoogstraten, 1979). In their variouspapers, Liipple\\nand van Hoogstraten argue the case for the existence within the\\ncapitalist modeofproduction of adominant tendency towards\\nincreasing geographical concentration. Theirargument has a\\nnumber ofstrands. Theypostulate that increases in the social\\nproductivity oflabourrequire,undercapitalism, acorresponding\\nexpansion in the scale ofproduction. Itisarguedthatany\\nlocational decision in any unit of production within any particular\\nsectorwill be subject to two sets ofinfluences - \\'natural\\' conditions\\n(such as the availability of rawmaterials , the existence of\\'natural\\'\\ntransport routes)and\\'social\\'conditions (such as the natureofthe\\nlabourforce, accessibility to othersectors).Itis then suggested that\\nthe direct influence of \\'natural\\' conditions mustdiminish over time\\ninrelationtothatofsocialconditions , andfurtherthat that shift in\\nbalance implies an increasing degree ofgeographical concentration. 46 Spatial Divisions ojLabour\\nBut must this changeofemphasis between different typesof\\n\\'locationfactors\\'produce an increasing degree ofspatialconcen\\xad\\ntration? Theauthors arguethattwothings,theincreasing\\nemancipation from a directdependence on\\'natural\\' location\\nfactors, and the development ofthe division oflabourboth work\\ntowardssuchconcentration ;thatthe reduced importance ofnatural\\nfactors entails a corresponding reduction in the tendency ofunitsof\\nproduction to disperse in response to their differing dependencies\\non such factors; and thatthe increasing division oflabourentails\\nalso itsopposite, the need for every individual plantto be inspatial\\ncontactwith the rest ofthe social collective labourer.\\'Alongwith\\ntheincreasing socialisation ofproduction theproductivity ofsocial\\nlabourbecomes even more strongly dependent on the possibilities\\nofthe systematic combinat ion in space ofthedifferent stagesof\\nproduction\\'(Lapple andvanHoogstraten, 1979, p. 10). The\\nmechanisms beingpointedto here are certainly real. The increasing\\ndivisionoflabourisatvariance with the(corresponding) increase in\\nthe need for contactbetween the different partsoftotallabour.But\\ndoes this meanthatproduction will be increasingly spatially\\nconcentrated? The conflict is between anarchy and the need for\\nsocialisation ,whichisnotnecessarily thesameasbetween\\ndispersion andconcentration .Certainly the need for contactwill\\nprovidea pull in thatdirection, butotherfactorswill also be\\noperative . Thegrowthin theproductivity oflabourwill also\\nincrease the ease ofcrossing space (the annihilation ofspace by\\ntime); some social factors, such as costs oflabour, may work in the\\nopposite direction, increasing precisely as a result ofconcentration .\\nClearly, the growing division oflabourwill reinforce the need for\\nsystematic combination andorganisation ofspatialcontacts, but\\nthis does not necessarily imply spatialconcentration .Whathas been\\nunearthed is one influence. Ithas not been established thatit will\\nnecessarily be dominant. Exactly the same reservations apply to the\\nnext stage oftheargument, whichconcerns thetertiarysector. Once\\nagain an important tendency has been highlighted, but what does\\nnot seem to have been satisfactorily established isthatthis is in any\\nsense the dominant tendency.\\nLappleand vanHoogstraten do indeed consider the possibility of\\ncounter-influences, thatis, tendencies towardsthespatialdispersion\\nofproduction. They identify two. The first is thattheincreasing size\\nofindividual capitals, in thecontextoftheincreasing divisionof\\nlabour,enablesthesplitting up ofdifferent functions within the Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 47\\nproduction process, and their separate, anddifferentiated , loca\\xad\\ntional responses. The second is, as already mentioned, thatthe fact\\nof spatial concentration may itself produce negative effects and\\nconsequently a tendency to decentralisation, especially on the part\\nof relativelyweak firms and sectors of production. But, they argue,\\nthese are not the dominant tendencies because ofthe increasing\\nnecessityfor State provision ofthe general conditions ofproduction\\nand ofreproduction . At this point the explanation amounts not so\\nmuch to an argument as to an empirical observation. Indeed, for\\nmany writers the elucidation ofnecessary spatial tendencies under\\ncapitalism hasconsisted ofobservation ofactualempirical\\ntendencies followed by attempts tore-readthem as logically\\nnecessary outcomes of a pure capitalist mode of production. Quite\\napartfrom all the epistemological disadvantages referred to earlier,\\nsuch aprocedure opens itselfup to simple refutation by referenceto\\nempirical examples ofthe opposite tendency. At the time of writing,\\nfor instance, the phenomenon of\\'usines isolees\\' isprobably the\\nmost discussed aspect of the changing geography ofproduction in\\nwestern Europe.\\nFinally, what ismeant, afterall, by spatial centralisation? Clearly\\nmostauthors on thesubjectarereferring notonly to the\\ncentralisation ofcontroloverproduction , but also to the centralisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction itself. But what is meant exactly? How would\\none goaboutevaluating it - by proportions of wage-earners, by\\nwages of wage-earners, by amountof capital investment or some\\nmeasure of production? The responses have been varied, and often\\nambiguous. The implication we draw here is thatcentralisation \\xad\\nand indeed geographical inequality in general - is not to be\\nmeasured on some simple linear dimension of inequality but must\\nrefer more to a structure ofdominant relations between elements of\\nthe economies of different \\'regions\\'. But how does one compare\\nsuchstructures ofdominance to decide whether or not centralisa\\xad\\ntion isincreasing?Indeed, might not such structures vary not just in\\ndegree but also in kind?\\nThe issue is yet more complicated than this. Apartfrom the\\nproblem of the variables on which it is to be measured, what does\\n\\'increasing centralisation\\' mean ingeographical terms? Does it mean\\nthatthoseregionswhich gain the initialadvantage become\\nincreasingly dominant, and the peripheral regions increasingly\\npoor? This patternis what is implied by most versions of the\\n\\'cumulative causation\\' model. Yet how, in thatcase, can clear cases 48SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nofreversal bedealtwith?WhatofBelgium, where once the\\nindustrial mightofthesouthwasdominant but where the main\\ncentresofaccumulation are now in Flanders, with the old industrial\\nareas lying neglected anddepressed?\\nOneofthe main characteristics ofthedeveloping geography of\\ncapitalist societies so far has been precisely the development ofnew\\nareas and the abandonment of old. Even if we acceptthatthe\\nexistence ofproduction in a region does notin itself make that\\nregion a centreofaccumulation , the whole historyofcapitalism\\nindicates thatwhatwe need ISnot some single concept, such as\\n\\'centralisation\\', but a whole range ofconcepts which will allow the\\nanalysisofcomplicated, andchanging, structures ofgeographical\\ninequality . Toreturntoouroriginal theme, even had some general\\nlogicalspatialtendencies of\\'acapitalist modeofproduction\\' been\\nestablished , they would notin themselves be an explanation ofthe\\nenormously complex geographical historyofactualcapitalist\\nsocieties. Whatis needed is an approach which can deal with this\\never-changing complexity.\\n* * *Thethirdelement, and puttingall thistogether, isthatwhat we are\\nconcerned with inempirical analysis is geographical andhistorical\\nspecificity. Indeed,whatlies behind the whole notionofuneven\\ndevelopment is the fact ofhighlydifferentiated anduniqueout\\xad\\ncomes.Thatformofanalysis which combines economism with a\\nsimpleapplication ofdeduced laws has createda divorce within\\ncertainstrandsofMarxism between \\'theory\\' and the analysis of\\nparticular situations .Itis a divorce which parallels thatbetween the\\npatently inapplicable mathematical industrial location theoryand\\nthe collapse into simple description by much ofthebehavioural\\nschoolingeography, and by many concerned with real empirical\\nanalysis. Further, whenattempts are made to use such theoryin\\nempirical analysis then,justas with models offirms and their\\nimperfect realisation in the world, so with laws and actualhistor\\xad\\nicaldevelopments: behaviour is split into two andthe world is\\ndivided between the inexorable a prioriand the purely descriptive\\ndeviation. The models offirmsdeveloped bothin classical industrial\\nlocation theoryandsubsequently in thebehavioural school,both\\ninterpreted the factofspecificity as one of mismatch betweentheory\\nand reality. It was a problem; andbothcoped with it by dividing\\nanalysis, and by implication company behaviour, intotwocomp\\xad\\nletelydifferent parts-thatwhichaccorded with the a priorimodel Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 49\\nandthatwhich was attributed to\\'additional factors\\'derived simply\\nfromobserving anddescribing thisparticular individual case\\n(Massey, 1976). Certain formsofMarxism standindangerof\\nreproducing the same mismatch and the same untenable dichoto\\xad\\nmy.Moreover, \\'precisely because no\"fact\"canrepresent a\\nchallenge to the inexorable courseofhistory,we canaffordto be\\nnegligent with facts. This attitude, paradoxically ,createstwoorders\\nof reality. The first, thatofthe necessary laws ofevolution , which is\\ntheorised in a rigorous fashion, represents thelatentmeaning of\\nhistory. The second, the orderoffacts, in the absence of any\\nperspective which would allow a theoretical analysisofthe con\\xad\\njuncture, amounts to no more than a sum of empirical circum\\xad\\nstances\\'(Laclauand Mouffe, 1981, p. 18).The implications ofsuch\\nanapproach aredeleterious not only to analysis but also to political\\nintervention . On the one handthere is little thatcan bedoneabout\\ntheinexorable. On the otherhand,mechanistic analyses are\\nfollowed by a polities with which they have little connection (see,\\nfor example, Dunford,GeddesandPerrons, 1981).\\'An ever-greater\\nchasm is thus established between the expedients ofday-to-day\\npolitical practice and the aprioristic knowledge ofthe laws of\\nhistory\\'(Laclau and Mouffe, 1981, p. 18). The pointoftheoretical\\nconcepts, andofframeworks such as those elaborated here, is to\\nprovide tools for the analysis ofspecificsituations, analyses on\\nwhichactioncan be based.\\n2.4 The social and the spatial:an impossible dichotomy\\nGeography matters\\nJust as most locational studies have failed to relate geographical\\nchanges to wider social relations, so have most studiesofsocial\\nrelations ignoredgeography .Conceptual work in economics and\\nsociology frequently proceeds as thoughthe world existed on the\\nheadofa pin - as thoughit were distanceless andspatially\\nundifferentiated .Theacademic disciplinary division oflabour\\nbetween \\'substance\\' and\\'space\\' has doneharmtoboth.The\\n\\'substance laws\\' ofeconomics and sociology have been spatially\\nblind, while geography has been periodically thrownintoparoxysms\\nofself-doubt aboutwhetherit had a real object ofstudy,and if so,\\nwhat it was. 50 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nGeography\\'s answers to this conundrum have varied over time.\\nFormuch of its history, a central focus ofhumangeography has\\nbeen \\'the region\\', defined as a distinct area oftheearth\\'ssurface,\\nand the concern ofgeographers was tounderstand theinterrelation\\xad\\nship between different aspects of the naturaland social world, \\'from\\ngeology to politics\\', which went to make up the distinctiveness of\\ndifferent places.The emphasis, then, was on the unique. All this was\\noverthrown in the I960s. As in otherdisciplines, thatdecade\\nbrought with it a new dominance ofavarietyofformsof\\npositivism. There was a search after empirically-generalisable laws\\nandan obsession with the quantitative. Uniqueness was now\\nsomething to benormalised-away, reduced toconformity .In\\nmethod,geography thusbecame indistinguishable fromother\\ndisciplines. Its raison d\\'etre, therefore, had to be defined in terms\\nof its object ofstudy, and geography set itself up as \\'thescience of\\nthespatial\\'. Theapproach to the analysis ofspatialpatternby\\ncorrelation between maps with which we began this chapteris a\\nlingering and low-key empirical inheritance fromgeography\\'s\\ntheoretical self-definition of the sixties. A realm of \\'thespatial\\'\\nwasdemarcated. Spatialdistributions were analysed as the result of\\nspatialprocesses (processes operating overspace but defined\\nwithoutanysubstance referents), there were attempts to identify\\npurely spatial mechanisms (gravity models were much in vogue),\\nthere was a search after\\'spatiallaws\\'.\\nAlong with much else, this came under firein the seventies. It was\\npointedoutthatthere were no such things as \\'purelyspatial\\nprocesses\\'. There were only particular social processes operating\\nover space. Spatialform and spatial distributions , it was argued, are\\nthe result not ofspatial processes (for there are no such things) but\\nofsocial processes. It was at this pointthatmanygeographers went\\noff to learn sociology or economics, or whatever discipline related\\nto thesubstance lawsoftheir bitofthe subject. The introduction of\\nproduction intoindustrial geography was thus a particular instance\\nofthe more general move to introduce social processes into the\\nexplanation ofgeographical form.\\nBut this reaction of the seventies itselfhad problems - the relative\\nimportance of the social and the spatialwas simply reversed; the\\ntwocontinued to beconceptualised asseparate realms.Geographi\\xad\\ncalpatterns were now understood as simply the result ofthe\\ndistribution ofsocial processes over space. Geography was reduced\\ntomapping theoutputofotherdisciplines; \\'space\\'was reduced to a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 51\\npassive surface over which social processes were distributed . The\\nequally dispiriting corollary, of course, was that the social processes\\nthemselvescould continue to beconceptualised inaspatialterms. At\\nthispoint,bothspatialandsubstance disciplines were under\\xad\\nestimating the importance ofgeography.\\nFor geography matters. The fact thatprocesses take place over\\nspace, the facts ofdistance or closeness, of geographical variation\\nbetween areas, of the individual character and meaning of specific\\nplaces and regions - all these are essential to the operation of social\\nprocesses themselves. Just as there are no purely spatialprocesses,\\nneither are there any non-spatial social processes. Nothing much\\nhappens, bar angels dancing, on the head of a pin. The title ofthis\\nsection refers to the frequent separation of the inseparable. Nordo\\nany of these processes operatein anenvironmentally characterless,\\nneutral and undifferentiated world.Geography in the fuller sense\\nimpliesnot only spatial distance but also physical differentiation, of\\nterrain,ofvegetation, ofclimate. Such physical features and\\nvariations areimportant. Their impact, use and meaning will, of\\ncourse, be socially constructed, but that construction isofsome\\xad\\nthing.Timpanaro has written of biology: \\'To maintain thatsince\\nthe \"biological\" is always presented to us as mediated by the\\n\"social\", the\"biological\" is nothing and the \"social\" iseverything,\\nwould ...be idealist sophistry\\' (1974, p. 16).The same applies to\\nthe physical differentiation oftheearth\\'ssurface. There are real\\nenvironmental influences and constraints. But even to conceptualise\\nspace and naturalphysical features in this way (as influence on, or\\nconstraint) is to presuppose a separation, parallel to thatsupposed\\nbetween the social and the spatial more generally, and which is\\nequally untenable - first the social processes, then the influences on\\nthem (Williams, 1978). \\'People and Natureare notseparate: weare\\npartofNatureand tostartin theconventional mannerwith such a\\nseparation followed by a listing ofinteractions would be to\\nprejudice every otheraspect of the exposition\\' (A. Sayer, 1979,\\np. 22).Geography in both its senses, ofdistance/nearness/between\\xad\\nness and of the physical variation of theearth\\'ssurface (the two\\nbeing closely related) is not a constraint on a pre-existing non\\xad\\ngeographical social and economic world. Itisconstitutive ofthat\\nworld.\\nWhat does it mean, then, to say thatgeography, or space, has an\\neffect;thatgeography matters? Clearly it is not to say thatspace\\nalters the processes themselves. Thatwould be to re-posit the 52SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nseparation. Thestatement concerns ouranalysisofthose processes.\\nSubstance laws and analyses ofsocial processes might be different\\nwere they to make integral the fact oftheir necessarily spatial\\ncharacter. Itiscertainly invalid for geographers to seek to define\\nabstractly spatialprocesses withoutreference to substantive con\\xad\\ntent. But it is equally invalid for those in substance disciplines to\\nignore the fact thattherelations they study take place over space\\nand in a geographically-differentiated world.\\'\\n***\\nWhen we take seriously the fact thatthe social processes involved in\\nthedevelopment ofcapitalist relations ofproduction take place \\'in a\\ngeographical world\\',ouranalysisofthem changes. Takea few\\nexamples.\\nProduction change (the development of the forces of production,\\nchanges in the labourprocess, etc.) and locational change may often\\nbealternative ways in which capital can achieve the same ends. The\\nfactofspatialvariation in thelabourforce may give management\\ngreaterflexibility in decisions aboutproduction. If aproduction\\nprocess is potentially mobile it may be easier to move to an area of\\nlow wages thantointroduce, through investment in technical\\nchange, ashiftin thenatureofthelabourprocess.Either\\nstrategy, production change or location change, can be used to\\nachieve the same result - a lowering oflabourcosts. This is a\\nrelation (in this case a choice) between production changeand\\ngeographical changewhich presents itself at a particular moment.It\\nis more likely to changethe speed ratherthan the overall direction\\nofmajortendencies. But it is not justa localised or minoreffect.\\nWhatwould have happened to thedevelopment ofthelabour\\nprocess in clothing, in textiles, in electronics assembly, over the last\\ntwenty years had multinational capitalnot found the desperately\\ncheaplabourreservesoftheThirdWorld?Noris itjusta caseof\\ntheavailability of cheap labourslowing down the necessity for\\nautomation orotherformsoftechnological change. The ability to\\nkeep processes manual, asopposed toautomated, can speed up\\ntechnological innovation in theproduct. Froebel, Heinrichs and\\nKreye (1980) found examples ofthis in their study ofthe new\\ninternational division oflabour. TheyquotetheUnitedStates\\nTariffCommission: \\'Manufacturers statethatsuch rapid changes in\\nthemarketdiscourage economical automation ofproduct lines;\\nautomation would tend (1) to prevent productinnovation because Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 53\\noftheinvestment required, and (2) slow the advance oftechnology\\nvital to maintaining theircompetitive position withregardto\\nimports\\' (quotedon p. 335). It is not justthatproduction shapes\\ngeography; the historically-evolved spatialconfiguration (boththe\\nfact of spatial differentiation and itsparticular nature)has its\\ninfluence on the course taken by accumulation itself.\\nSo the pace, certainly, of changes in the labourprocess will be\\ninfluenced by the kind oflabouravailable, and the variation in it.\\nAnd much ofthisvariability will bespatially organised .Indeed,\\nspatialseparation may be a condition ofthevariation itself.To take\\none obvious, simple example: the fact ofspatialseparation is often\\nanimportant element in the preservation ofparticular, local,\\nconditions ofproduction - low wages, loyalty to the company\\nand aconcomitant lackofmilitancy may be easier for a company to\\nensure in an isolated area where there is a degree oflocalspatial\\nmonopoly over the labourforce. And more generally distance, as\\nwe shall see, has been a great divider oftheworking class, an\\nimportant condition for theperpetuation ofdifferences.\\nFurther,whetheror not the adoption ofaparticular production\\ntechnique and its constituent labourprocesses is accompanied by\\nspatialseparation ofdifferent stagesofproduction will depend on\\nwhetheror not there are spatially-differentiated labourmarkets, or\\nspatialdifferentiation ofsome sort. And, in turn,thatspatial\\nresponse itself may influence the internalorganisation ofthe finn.\\nParticular formsoforganisation oftechnology maybeadopted to\\nenableadvantage to be taken ofparticular geographical patterns.\\nThe fact thatcompanies becomemultilocational (still more, multi\\xad\\nnational) may be the impetus for thedevelopment ofparticular\\nformsofmanagement hierarchies, particular subdivisions ofthe\\nrelations of economic ownership and possession. Different ways of\\nbreaking down the production process, to take advantage of\\nspecific forms of spatialvariation, may inturnstimulate different\\nways ofdisaggregating therelations ofownership and possession,\\nand therefore give rise to different kindsofmanagerial social\\ngroups.Itis notjustthatthegrowthofthemultilocational\\ncompany means the distribution ofthemanagement hierarchy\\nand theassociated relations ofproduction over space but thatthe\\nfact and form ofspatialdistribution may itself influence how those\\nhierarchies and relations develop. In an early and important work,\\nStephen Hymer (1972) pointedouthow inmultilocational compa\\xad\\nnies different functions of management (i.e. within the overall 54SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nrelations of production) weredistributed in hierarchical fashion\\nbetween different geographical places. Itis interesting to reflect on\\nthis, not justfor its implications for uneven development over\\nspace, but also for whetherthe need to devise some form ofspatial\\nstructure itself influenced the development of the division oflabour\\nwithin managerial functions.\\nHistorically, ofcourse, the whole process is a circular one.\\nDistributions of class relations and different social groups over\\nspace are in partaproduct of these processes and operateas\\nlocation factors in subsequent periods of investment. Reserves of\\nlabour,for instance, are the productofsocial relations; they don\\'t\\njusthappen. And such local variations in class and social structure\\ncan intumhave significant effects on location.\\nThis is to concentrate on what happens to the analysis of\\nspecified processes when we recognise their necessarily geographi\\xad\\ncalcharacter. There may also be categories and processes the\\noperation ofwhichcannotbeunderstood without recognising\\ntheir internal spatial structuring. Thenational rate of growth of\\nwages may be set by the regionwherelabourisstrongest\\n(something whichhappened inBritainin the fifties) - what\\neconomists, when they look spatially below the national level,\\nmight explain by geographical rigidities. An assessment of the\\nsupply of and demand forlabourat thenational level, or of its\\nnational-level strength, would not be able to isolate the process at\\nwork.Not,it should be repeated, thatspace, or geographical\\nvariation, has any necessary consequences in andofitself\\xad\\nworkers in the region with the highest level of economic activity\\ncould have been constantly undermined byan influx of unemployed\\nlabourfrom elsewhere (which did happen,as we have seen, some\\ndecades earlier). Itis notthataparticular form of spatial variation\\nwillhave a particular outcome, itselfproduce a necessaryeffect. But\\nthe factofspatialvariation willdemand some social response. It is\\nnot\\'space\\'itself which accounts for the impact on the national\\neconomy but social and economic processes operating spatially.The\\nfactofregional inequality and differentiation can either help or\\nhinder the national rateofaccumulation, and can beaprofound\\ninfluence on State policy towards the economy.\\nItis not, then, justaquestion ofmapping social relations\\n(economic, sociological or whatever) on tospace. The fact that\\nthose relations occur over space matters. Itis notjustthat\\'space is\\nsociallyconstructed \\' - a fact with which geographers have for a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 55\\nwhile been coming to terms - butthatsocialprocesses are\\nconstructed over space.\\nThinking back to earlier arguments, partofthe necessity for the\\nspecificity ofempirical analyses results from geographical variation\\nin theoperation ofeconomic and social processes and from the\\nparticular localcombinations and local developments ofthose\\nprocesses which go to make up the uniqueness ofplace.\\nSo far, wehave givenjust a fewexamples to illustrate the fact and\\nthe variety of the influences of\\'thegeographical\\' . But the subject\\ncan beapproached more systematically. Quite centrally, location\\nandgeographical mobility are key factors in the conflict between\\nlabourand capital within production. The simple fact of distance,\\nof spatial separation, can beimportant. Dual-sourcing, by avoiding\\ncomplete dependence on a single workforce or a single site, is an\\nobvious example. Another is thatmentioned earlier where a simple\\nshift of location may make it easier for management tointroduce a\\nnewproduction technique, or even simply new work practices.\\nGeographical mobility is often involved in attempts to bring new\\nsocial groups into the workforce. The detailed choice of a local site\\nmight have a kind ofsymbolic significance and effect. In Greenock,\\nScotland, the detailed location ofIBM issignificant and apparently\\nhighly effective. The company employs male workers in an area\\ntraditionally associated with shipbuilding and heavy engineering.\\nInto this contextIBMbroughtademand for relatively unskilled\\nlabourand adetermination to establish a non-union plant(Steuer\\netal.,1973). Workers werechosen carefully, not on the basis ofskill\\nbut on being \\'therightsortofperson\\' for the IBM project, people\\nwho would fit in with the task required, \\'areliable and responsible\\ntype of person\\'. Unionisation was to be avoided at all costs, and\\nconditions andstartingpay were good relative to the area. The\\nresulting social set-upat the factory cut acrossmanyofthe\\nestablished work mores of the district (Steuer et al..1973). And\\nthe whole effect was reinforced by the site ofthe plant. As the\\nSteuerreportput it: the company standsapart,both socially and\\ngeographically.The location far from the town, in a pleasantvalley,\\naway from all otherplacesofemployment, contributes to the\\nseparateness and symbolises the philosophy.\\nOne ofcapital\\'s crucialadvantages overlabouris its great, and\\nincreasing, geographical mobility. Time and again throughthe hist\\xad\\norical development of industry whole sectors have shifted location\\nto escape a well-organised workforce, thereby both lowering labour 56SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ncosts and re-establishing the controlling power of capital over\\nlabour- the movement of the hosiery industry in the United\\nKingdom fromLondon to themidlands from the eighteenth\\ncentury (Wells, 1972) and of the textile industry in the United\\nStates from New England to the south are justtwo of the better\\nknown examples. In these cases, and in some of those givenearlier,\\nit is not simple geographical mobility which is at issue but mobility\\nbeyond the spatial boundaries oforganisational coherence of the\\nemployees. Again, \\'space itself(in the sensehere of separateness, or\\ndistance) guarantees noparticular outcome. The spatial mobility of\\ncapitalis pitted against the geographical solidarity oflabour.\\nFinally, and implicit in all of these, capital can make positive use,\\nin a way labourcannot, ofdistance anddifferentiation. The\\napproach to the analysis of spatial structures which is introduced\\ninChapter3 is designed precisely to enable this to be examined.\\nThe\\'orderof analysis\\', then, in social sciencesshould not be first\\ntheaspatial, or the\\'aggregate\\' (often conceived as the aspatial) and\\nthen the distribution over space; first production and only then\\nlocation. \\'Geography\\' shouldbepartof the specification from the\\nbeginning. The reproduction of social and economic relations and\\nof the social structure takes place over space, and thatconditions its\\nnature.\\nPlaces and politics\\nSocial relations and social structure, and the character of both\\nlabourand capital, can vary quite dramatically within an individual\\ncountry. Oneelement ofthis is simply thattherelationsof\\nproduction are unevenly distributed over space and so, therefore,\\nare theconstituent social classes and social groups. Thatis a large\\npartof the subject matterof this book. But it is also thatthe\\nconstitution ofsocialgroupsactually occurs\\'spatially\\', i.e. in\\nplaces. We have already argued that economic function within the\\nrelations of production isnot an adequate basisfor \\'whole empirical\\nclasses\\' and thatother social relations and ties and commonalities\\ncan form the basis for intraclass, and cross-class, variation and\\nantagonism .Geographical separation and distance can operatein\\nprecisely that way. One element of this is thatthe wider social\\nrelations (wider, thatis, than the world of work) in which social Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 57\\ngroupsareconstituted andreproduced are inmanywaysspatially\\nbounded. Theplace-based relations between work and community,\\nforinstance, formpartofwhatWrightwould call structural class\\ncapacities . And they are an important influence on local class\\ncharacter, and thus on geographical variation inthatcharacter.\\nThenatureoftheeconomic base itself can give rise to long-lingering\\nlocalcharacteristics .Compare theindividualistic stroppiness of\\nMerseyside workers, with a long historybehindthemofcasual\\nlabouron the docks, with the organised discipline ofminers from\\nSouthWales (see Beynon, 1973, pp. 70-1). The enormously varied\\ngeographical patchwork which forms the industrial base even within\\noneadvanced capitalist countryis still of fundamental importance\\nas a basis ofsocial and cultural variations, local loyalties, and\\ntherefore potential misunderstandings andantagonisms within, in\\nparticular, thenational working class.Itis never justaquestion\\nmerelyofindustrial history,ofcourse.Thecontrast between\\nCatholicism andnonconformism has clearly also been important\\nin the difference between Liverpool and the Welsh valleys. Local\\ncultures andtraditions oforganisation can develop a life oftheir\\nown - the bargaining strength ofCoventry carworkers is an\\nexample.\\nThere have at times in recent years been flurries ofdebateover\\nwhether one can identify in Britaintoday\\'regional classes\\', and\\nwhat such a term might mean. A\\'regional class\\' would seem to\\nrefer not to a national class or stratum which is geographically\\nconcentrated (there are examples ofthese) but to such a degree of\\ngeographical differentiation within a class thatthe elements demand\\nseparate definition. Fora while the debatewasboundup withthat\\naboutthe useofdependency theoryinintranational analysis. The\\nunderstanding whichinformsthisbookisthatwhatwe are dealing\\nwith in the UnitedKingdom aregeographical variations within\\nnational classes. The importance of thedebate,though, was to\\nemphasise theconsiderable, andgeographically-structured , variety\\nwhich lies behind a term such as \\'the British working class\\'.Noris\\nitjusttheworking class which is thus differentiated . Clearly, the\\nverydifferent natureof \\'capital\\' and the high degree ofitsspatial\\nmobility, in money form and as a social relation, meansthatas it\\ndevelops it can, more quickly thanlabour,freeitselffromparticular\\ngeographical bases. But long histories in particular partsof the\\ncountrycan still be important, even inmoulding thecharacter of 58 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ncapital. Local histories and local distinctiveness are integral to the\\nsocial nature of production relations which wehave already argued\\nshould be central to any attemptat \\'characterising capital\\'.\\nForboth capital and labourtwo parallel and related processes\\nare inoperation . On the one hand the business of overcoming\\ndistance, of the flexibilityof relations over space and the movement\\ntowards the formation ofsupraregional andsupranational links and\\nallegiances . On the otherhand,and inparallel, thegradual\\ndestruction of local distinctiveness. Forcapital,bothchanges are\\nproceeding apace, and on the whole both add strengthto its arm.\\nForthe working class the process ismore one-sided and ambiguous.\\nTheformation ofany kind ofinterregional andinternational\\nconsciousness is slow and halting. Yet even while wider links are\\ndifficult to establish, localdistinctiveness isoften being undermined.\\nAnd for the working class, local distinctiveness can be both a\\ndisadvantage - inproducing divisions at a higher level- and the\\nsourceoflocal coherence and strength. The balance between gain\\nanddisadvantage isthe object of struggle and open to question. But\\nwhatever the future holds, it is clear thatgeography, and class\\nrelations to geography, will remain offundamental importance .\\nAll this is still to talk in class terms, of differentiation within\\nclasses. But political subjects, as we have seen, are not always\\ndefined in class terms, and one possibility is thatnon-class political\\nsubjects are defined in spatialterms - in terms of locality.\\nSome intraclass (or cross-class) spatial differences can develop to\\nsuch an extent thatgeography itself may become a politically self\\xad\\nconsciously chosen and defining characteristic. People in different\\npartsof thecountryexperience different economic fortunes at any\\none time; \\'thecrisis\\' hits different regions in different ways. People\\ndemand jobs- for their region, their locality, their inner city.\\nVariationsin levelsofprosperity, in the kinds of class dynamics, in\\nkindsofconflict, mean thatlocalsubgroups may face highly\\ncontrasting immediate problems, and have very different immedi\\xad\\nateinterests, evenantagonistic ones, at anyone time. Such\\ndifferences and antagonisms are often exacerbated through tacit\\nencouragement. The open hostility ofpeople in London and\\nBirmingham to the regional policy ofthe 1960s,designed to divert\\njobs to the peripheral regions, is a case in point. At such junctures,\\ntheprimaryaspectofgroupdefinition and allegiance may become\\ngeographical. Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 59\\nMore obviously, the constitution of some political subjects isfrom\\nthe beginning and by definition spatial. Community groupsare a\\nclear example at the very local end ofthegeographical spectrum,\\nwhileat the otheristhe whole host of \\'regional\\' issueswhich,at least\\nin Europe,from Catalonia toLaplandand from CroatiatoScotland,\\nhave figured increasingly prominently innationalpolitical debate. A\\nnumber ofanalysts,such as Urry (1981a)and Nairn(1981),in rather\\ndifferent ways suggest that this kind of impact of geography may be\\nincreasingin importance at themomentwithin the United Kingdom.\\nEither way, the general point is that, whatever the political subjects,\\nthey are formed in the context of social processes and conflicts, and\\nthese take place in places.\\nAparticularly clearexample todayoftheimportance of\\ngeographical variation can be seen in Belgium. There, the very\\nprocess of forming a nationalgovernment has been made extremely\\nhazardous byinterregional differences and antagonisms which\\nresult from a combination ofcontrasting economic fortunes and\\ncultural and linguistic backgrounds, and which at times have\\neruptedinto street violence. Inan early article, Mandel (1963)\\npointed to the very different classhistories ofFlanders and\\nWallonia as theconditioning forcebehindthelong-running\\nantagonisms. Thecompetitive strength of Belgian industry, he\\nargued, was based on a combination ofadvanced technology and\\ndepressed wages. And one of the causes of the very low wage levels\\nwas regional differentiation . \\'Belgium was only halfindustrialised,\\nforFlanders remained essentially agricultural. The cost ofliving,\\ntherefore, remained low and there was always an abundant reserve\\narmy oflabourto keep wage levelsto a minimum\\' (p. 8). It isan old\\nstory, and one which can be told, in different ways, for many\\nEuropean countries at different stages of their development: from\\nBritain in the early nineteenth century, and again to some extent\\nbetween the wars, to Italy for virtually all ofthe lasthundred years.\\nThose regional wage differentials in Belgium were not simply a\\nproductof different industrial structures.

Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 61\\n2.5Anexample\\nAspects ofthisapproach have been illustrated insomerecent\\nanalyses of Italy, in particular thoseby Secchi (1974 and1977).\\nSecchi\\'s thesis is thatanimportant link between the development of\\ntheItalianeconomy as a whole andthedevelopment ofregional\\ndisparities within it has been the changing useoflabourandthe\\nrelatedtechnical changesinproduction . Hepointsto the fact that\\nsince the end ofthenineteenth century theItalianeconomy has\\nexperienced contrasting phasesin the use of labourandthatthese\\nhavecoincided withchangesininterregional disparities. Heargues\\nfurtherthatthesedifferent stages of development have reflected\\ndifferent economic andlocational strategies in themajordivisions\\noftheItalianeconomy andtheeconomic andpolitical hegemony of\\ndifferent socialgroups,themselves relatedto thesemajordivisions .\\nSecchi\\'scharacterisation ofdifferent partsoftheeconomy enables\\nhim toestablish arelationship between, first, variouscharacteristics\\nofproduction (production technology andtheorganisation of\\nlabour, labourdemand, sizeandsocialstructure ofcapital),\\nsecond,locational strategy,andthird, theconnections to the\\nvarious armsofStatepolicy,including regional policy,and\\nconsequently to the main systems ofpolitical allianceandconflict\\nwithincapitalas a whole.\\nThe divisions identified by Secchi in his characterisation of\\nItaliancapitalreflect the particular importance inthatcountry of\\ndifferentiation between large and small companies andofthe role of\\ntheStateinproduction . The\\'organisational structure ofcapital\\'\\nemerges, in otherwords, as particularly important , withnumerous\\nindustries (textiles, food and drink,mechanical engineering , light\\nchemicals , etc.) being dichotomised between a few large firms and\\nnumerous small ones. This division is one which is also often\\nreflected in theorganisation ofthelabourprocess. Thusthe\\ndistinction between large and small firms in sectorssuch as textiles\\nand food, drinkandtobacco mirrorsadifference not only in the\\nkindofcapitalinvolved butalso in the typicalproduction\\ntechnology andlabourprocess. The second main,thoughvery\\nbroad,lineofpartition reflectsmajorstructural divisions withinthe\\neconomy. Secchi\\'s characterisation ofItaliancapital, inother\\nwords, is bothspecific to Italy(thereis nochanceofimporting it\\nunmodified to theUnitedKingdom) andbearsa clearrelationto\\nhisanalysis ofthemainfactorsin thecountry\\'seconomic 62 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ndevelopment. It reflectsthe importance, within that development, of\\nthe dual processes ofhigh levelsof technological advance, in certain\\nperiods and in certain industries, alongside the continued preserva\\xad\\ntionofimportant \\'traditional\\' sectors.\\nMoreover, thischaracterisation ofItaliancapitalmakes it\\npossible to establish coherent relations between the division ofthe\\neconomy and a wide range ofothercharacteristics and forms of\\nbehaviour. Apartfrom obviously closely related aspects such as\\nchanges in technology and the organisation ofwork and the\\nmovement of labourproductivity, these include also such things\\nas the flows oflabourbetween sectors, the relation to the land\\nmarket,the relation to different arms ofState policy, and the main\\nsystemsofalliance and conflict. This last - the main systems of\\nalliance and conflict - refers to the positions taken by capital in\\neachpartof the economy to a whole variety of issues, both political\\nand economic. The fact thateachparttends to be affected in a\\nparticular way bynationalandinternational economic changes, and\\nthatwithin each the constituent elements have similar internal\\ncharacteristics, leads tocharacteristic groupings (i.e.. alliances and\\nconflicts) on such issuesas foreign trade policy,domestic policieson\\nnationalised industries, on laboursupply, training, etc., on incomes\\npolicy and, of course, on regional policy. The introduction ofthis\\naspectofthedifferentiation ofcapitalwithin an economy is\\nextremely important, for it allows links to be made not only\\nbetweennationaland regional policies,and the attitudeof different\\npartsofcapital to these, but also between the more purely economic\\nand the political determinants of uneven regional development, and\\nthe influence ofeach upon the other. This system ofpolitical\\nalliances is a main organising principleofthe analysis. Itisthrough\\nthatpolitical level thatthe impact of economic forces is translated.\\nSecchi\\'s characterisation ofthedevelopment oftheItalian\\neconomy as an alternation ofphasesofextensive and intensive\\ndevelopment, each ofwhich has distinct implications for the degree\\nandnatureofthedisparity between northandsouthofthat\\ncountry, is not therefore a characterisation merelyof\\'economic\\'\\nphases. The periodisation refers also to changing class relations,\\nand inparticular to changing relations between different partsof\\ncapitalon the one hand and different partsoflabouron the other.\\nSecchi states thathis \\'thesis is thatthe different phases correspond\\nto different development strategies pursued by the various leading\\neconomic sectors and social groups\\'(Secchi, 1977, p. 47). The Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 63\\nanalysis takes account notjustofthemajoreconomic phasesof\\ndevelopment, but also ofthe political strategies adopted to deal\\nwith them. The effects ofeconomic changesareunderstood as being\\ntranslated through politics; they are not the raw requirements of\\naccumulation . The essential unifying characterisation ofaparticu\\xad\\nlarperiodisbotheconomic and political, and itiscontradictions\\narticulated atthatlevel which markthe shift from one phase into a\\nnew one.\\nThus,the crisis of1963/4 - the end oftheItalianmiracle - was\\nnot simply an economic crisis,thoughitcertainly wasthat; it also\\nmarkedthe collapse ofa political alliance between different partsof\\ncapital,an alliance which had in the preceding periodheld sway\\nover the main lines ofeconomic and regional policy in Italy. Both\\n\\'miracle\\' andsubsequent crisis must, in otherwords, be defined in\\npolitical and class terms. Secchi argues thatthe extensive develop\\xad\\nmentofthe 1950s was a productof thedominance ofan alliance\\nbetween sectors ofindustry producing intermediate goods, largely\\ndominated by bigcapital,and large and mediumfirms in a range of\\notherindustries on the one hand,and those in the building industry\\non theother.It had been characterised by a high rate ofincreaseof\\nemployment (corresponding to thenotionofan \\'extensive\\' phase),\\nand by a high rate ofaggregate growthandofexports. Moreover,\\nthis fast rate ofgrowthinemployment occurred mainly in the\\nnorth,attracting increased migration from the south. These flows of\\nlabourled inturnto faster urbanisation and,particularly, to a high\\nrateofinvestment inhousing (hence the participation ofthe\\nbuilding sectorin the alliance). As a result ofthis, and also\\nbecauseofincreased wagedifferentials between the advanced\\nsectorsandothers,theregional effectofthealliance was an\\nincrease in the disparity between northandsouth. By 1958, this\\nstrategyofextensive development was beginning to come up against\\ndeepinternalcontradictions (Secchi, 1977, p. 43).The profligate use\\noflabourwas leading, in spite of migration, totighterlabour\\nmarkets andincreased money-wages. But more importantly in\\nSecchi\\'s analysis it was leading to \\'excessive\\' development ofthe\\nbuilding sector, a development which was due, precisely, to the\\ngeographical concentration of thelabourforce and of the popula\\xad\\ntion and which brought in its train soaringrents and all the\\nproblems ofover-rapidurbanisation. And,ofcourse,thaturban\\nconcentration was itself due in large measure to thepriorities of the\\nindustrial strategyof the 1950s. 64 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nTheeconomic crisisof1963/4 wasalso a political conflict between\\ntwopartsofthe ruling alliance:the advanced industrial sectors, and\\nthebuilding industry.Itwas,moreover, a crisis in which spatial\\ndisparities and the results oflocational change were themselves an\\nimportant component. The political alliance, throughitseconomic\\nstrategy, hadmajorspatialeffects(over-rapid urbanconcentration\\nandexacerbated regionalinequality) , and the repercussions ofthose\\neffects were, in turn,partofthe reason for its collapse. Spatial\\nstructure wascause aswellaseffect, inextricably intertwined with the\\ndevelopment ofeconomic and political processes.\\nIt was at this period thattheCentreLeft was formed, and the\\ncrisis in the ruling alliance was countered byproposals for \\'re\\xad\\nform\\'. These proposals had astrongterritorial content, bothurban\\nand regional, and on bothscores led to furtherconflict. On the\\nurbansidetherewereproposals forplanned controlofcity\\ndevelopment and for transfers of resources towards those social\\ngroupsmost affected by the increase in rents which had accom\\xad\\npaniedurbanisation and the boom in the building industry. The\\nproposals tocurburbangrowth were resisted and sharpintracapi\\xad\\ntalist conflict ensued (Secchi, 1977,pp.48-9).Similar battles took\\nplace over the attemptto establish a Tegional policy which, while\\nhaving aspects ofa social reform, could also have increased the\\ntotalamountoflabouravailable , thus reducing pressure on wages.\\nObviously, these conflicts were not justbetweendifferent partsof\\ncapital. \\'Tightlabourmarkets\\' and \\'pressure on wages\\' were\\nindications ofincreased potential strength amongtheworking\\nclass. In a situation ofnear \\'full employment\\' capitalist discipline\\nbecameharderto keep; the threatofdismissal became lesseffective.\\nThose who, migrating north,had for the first time joinedthe\\nnational industrial working class,understood and used their new\\xad\\nfoundstrength. In thisbattle, too, policy on the employers \\' front\\nwas by no means united. In a situation ofrelativelabourshortage\\nthere were frequent competitive wage increases and attempts by\\ndifferent partsofcapitaltomonopolise typesoflabourwhich had\\nbecomeparticularly scarce (Salvati, 1972, p. 15).\\nMuchofthe energy ofthe ruling alliance was thus also directed,\\noftenthrough thereforms themselves, againstthisnew-found\\nstrengthoftheworking class. The results ofall this, and therefore\\nthe future oflocation patterns andofregional inequality, thus\\nrested on the outcome ofa political battle, in which \\'geography\\'\\nitself was an integral element. 3\\nUnevenDevelopment andSpatial\\nStructures\\n3.1 The approach\\nIf the social is inextricably spatialand the spatialimpossible to\\ndivorce from its social construction andcontent, it follows not only\\nthat social processes shouldbeanalysed astakingplacespatially but\\nalso that whathave been thoughtofasspatialpatterns can be\\nconceptualised in termsofsocial processes.\\nOneoftheproblems ofthe \\'correlation ofmaps\\'approach to\\nindustrial locationisthatit is inclined to interpret the geography of\\nemployment as a two-dimensional pattern- morejobsin this region\\nthan that, more white-collar jobsherethanthere, etc. In a very\\nliteral sense it looks at the surfacephenomenon andconceptualises\\nit in terms ofitspatternas a surface. Itis on the basis ofthis\\npatterning thatexplanations , which are often embodied in similar\\nkindsofpatterns, aresought. (Hence the desire to explain\\ngeographical regularities ?) But if such geographical patterns are\\ntheoutcome ofsocioeconomic processes (operating over space) then\\ninordertounderstand apatternwe must go behind it and interpret\\nit in terms ofthestructure s and processes on which it is based. The\\ngeography ofemployment , inotherwords, can be conceptualised ,\\nnot only as a two-d imensional pattern- asthoughit were a purely\\nspatialphenomenon - but in terms ofthe social structures on which\\nit rests and the social processes ofwhich it is the outcome. The\\nprimary social process which the geography ofjobsreflects is\\nproduction. Thespatialdistribution ofemployment ,therefore , can\\nbeinterpreted as theoutcome ofthe way in which production is\\norganised over space. The question is, how to do it.\\nOne key to getting behind the two-dimensional viewofthe\\ngeography ofemployment isto begin by conceptualising that\\ngeography in terms ofthe social relations ofproduction.\\nThe fact that one region has jobsonly in direct production while\\nanotherclaims all the headquarters, orthatareas differ in their\\n65 66SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ndominant industries, orthatin oneareathejobson offer are\\noverwhelmingly manualwhile inanotherthere is a sizeable slice of\\nwhite-col\\\\ar andwell-paid employment inresearch, all these\\ndifferences reflect different forms of geographical organisation of\\ntherelations ofproduction. Whatare often called \\'interregional\\nrelations\\' Ireflect the same thing. Structures ofdominance and\\nsubordination between economic activities in different placesmirror\\nthe way in which, in any particular case, the relations ofproduction\\nareorganised over space. \\'Interregional relations\\' are therelations\\nofproduction over space.\\nThe aim, then, is to link two discussions - the one concerning\\nproduction and social class, and the otherconcerning spatial\\norganisation. Inrelationto much previous analysis within geogra\\xad\\nphy, the argument isthatwhat has been seen simply as the spatial\\ndistribution ofemployment isunderlain by, and can beapproached\\nthrough, analysis of the geographical organisation oftherelations\\nofproduction . Inrelation to thesubstantive social sciences the\\nargument isthatthe social structure oftheeconomy, the social\\nrelations ofproduction , necessarily develop spatially and in a\\nvarietyofforms. These forms we shal\\\\ call spatial structures of\\nproduction.\\nFrombothdisciplinary vantagepointsthisapproach highlights\\nthe fact that\\'space\\'is not a passive surface on to which the\\nrelations ofproduction aremapped, nor yet simply a negative\\nconstraint (in the sense, for instance, ofdistanceto be crossed). The\\nfactofspatiality is an integral and active condition. Inrelationto\\nproduction, spatialform and spatialstrategy canbean active\\nelementofaccumulation .Capitalcan make positive use ofdistance\\nanddifferentiation .Thischapterwillbegin to formulate someofthe\\nways it can do this, and to examine their effects.\\nIt isimportant to stress thatthereisa whole variety ofways in\\nwhichcapitalist production can beorganised geographically and\\ngreatvarietyin the way the relations ofproduction can be\\nstructured over space.

But the evidentcorollary isthatnoneofthem can be the\\nmodel of geographical behaviour for the whole ofmultilocational\\ncapital.\\nTheargument here isthatthere is no need for such a model, such\\nanarchetype .Whatthischapterdoes is to recognise from the start\\nthe existence and importance of variety.

As inChapter 2,whatis being presented is a frame\\xad\\nwork, not a blueprint.\\nBut, as was also emphasised inthatchapter, this stress on the\\nneed to confront empirical varietyshouldin no way be seen as\\nlicence to retreatintounsituated descriptive empiricism. Muchof\\nthe factual information produced by such studies,forinstance of\\nmanagerial structures , can indeed be given meaning byreformula\\xad\\ntion in terms oftheapproach suggested here.

Itis possible bothto recognise specificity and to\\nsituateit within the grander historical movements ofcapitalist\\nsocieties.\\n3.2Spatialstructures of capitalist production\\nConceptualising the spatial organisation ofproduction\\nEachofthedifferent archetypes mentioned in theintroduction to\\nthischapter represents apossible formoforganisation ofthe\\nrelations ofproduction over space. Let us begin by examining one\\nofthemfurther,anduncovering itsunderlying characteristics . One\\nofthebest-known formsofspatialorganisation atpresentisthat\\nwhich draws on the characteristics ofmulti-locational companies in\\nindustries such as electronics. It is usually described in terms ofa\\nhierarchy in which RandD andstrategic functions areperformed\\nat theheadquarters locationand there are a numberofotherplants,\\nfor simplicity say two, each in a different region, one branchplant\\nmanufacturing complex components , theotherbeing where the final\\nassembly iscarriedout. It is a spatialstructure which is well\\nrecognised at bothinternational andintranational levels.\\nWhatisinteresting aboutthisgeographical form isthat, when\\nexamined in termsoftheorganisation oftherelations ofproduction\\nover space, it is not one hierarchy at all, but a whole complex of\\nthem.Forthemoment they areconveniently treatedas twogroups.\\nMoreover, what these two different bundlesofhierarchies represent\\nis twodistinct,thoughrelated, aspects ofthedevelopment ofthe\\nrelations ofproduction incapitalist societies; two distinctaspectsof\\nthedynamic ofcapitalisteconomies.\\nThe first hierarchy isthatwhichconnects thedifferent plants,and\\nhence the different locations, in terms oftheirstatusas head\\xad\\nquartersorbranchplants.This iswhat might becalled a managerial\\nhierarchy and along it run the functions offinancial and adminis\\xad\\ntrativecontrol.Itmay bethatat HQ the long-range investment\\ndecisions are taken,which then form the parameters foractionfor\\nmanagement atbranchlevel.Itis at HQ too thatultimate control\\nover theproduction process, and ultimateauthority over thelabour\\nforce, is likely to lie. Such a hierarchy can beconceptualised in Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 69\\ntermsoftherelations ofproduction. Whatthisaspectofinter-plant\\nrelations represents is aparticular formofspatialorganisation of\\ntherelations ofeconomic ownership and therelations ofpossession.\\nFigure3.1indicates onebroadandgeneral form which these\\nrelations might take.\\nCapitalist development has been characterised bothby the\\nseparation ofeconomic ownership frompossession and by the\\ndevelopment ofcomplex hierarchies offunctions within each. In\\nthis aspect of the organisation ofmulti-Iocational companies we see\\nthesecomplex hierarchies spreadoutoverspace.Behindthe\\ndescriptive terms \\'headquarters\\' and \\'branch plant\\'lies a form of\\ngeographical organisation ofpartsoftherelations ofproduction .\\nIndeed, thedevelopment andincreasing complexity ofthese\\nrelations took place over space and in a geographically differen\\xad\\ntiatedcontext. Multi-Iocationality itself, as much as the increasing\\nsize of firms (the only thing usually referred to) musthave been\\nimportant inproducing the need for such hierarchies andin\\ninfluencing the forms whichthey have taken and the kinds of\\ndivisionoflabourwhich have developed within these functions.\\n\\'Geography\\' has been an essential constructive element in their\\ndevelopment.\\nOne bundle ofrelations in this\\'electronics archetype\\' , then, can\\nbe referred to broadlyas amanagement hierarchy, anditrepresents\\nthespatialhierarchisation oftherelations ofeconomic ownership\\nand possession.\\nIn the electronics example, however, this hierarchy isparalleled\\nbyanother-thatwithin the process ofproduction itself.RandD is\\nseparated from the production oftechnically morecomplex\\ncomponents, andthatinturnfrom the final assembly ofthe\\ncommodity . In this spatialstructure eachofthesestagesof\\nproduction isbothlocatedseparately from the othersandunder\\nthecontrolofthe same company.\\nInotherwords, in this case not only is the hierarchy ofrelations\\nofownership and possession spreadout indifferent locations but so\\nalsois thetechnical, ordetailed, division oflabourwithin\\nproduction. And in the electronics example someofthe\\'classic\\'\\ncharacteristics ofthatdivisionoflabourshow up very well. The\\nsequence ofstagesofproduction forms ahierarchy whichrepresents\\ndifferent degreesofremovalofjobcontrol(theindividual worker\\'s\\ncontrolover the physical means ofproduction), anddeskilling. In\\nthisparticular case the hierarchy represents also a very clear 70SpatialDivisions of Labour\\nDEGREE OF CONTROL OVER:\\nRelations ofpossession\\nRelations of\\neconomic controlof controlof\\nownership meansofproduction labour power\\n~\\nFULL FULL FULL\\ni.e.control over the i.e.control over entire i.e.control over the\\noverall investment and apparatus of entire supervisory\\naccumulation process production hierarchy\\nand\\nPARTIAL\\nparticipation in\\ndecisions concerning\\neither sub-units of the\\ntotalproduction\\nprocess or partial\\naspects of the entire\\nproduction process\\nIBRANCHI\\nPARTIAL PARTIAL PARTIAL\\nparticipation in control over one control over one\\ndecisions concerning a segment of the total segment of the\\nsub-unitofthe total production process supervisory\\nproduction process hierarchy\\nor\\nMINIMAL\\nparticipation in\\ndecisions concerning\\nnarrowaspects of\\nsub-units of production\\nFIGURE3.1Managerial hierarchies and relations ofownership and\\npossession: a basic shape\\nSource: adapted from Wright (1976).\\ndistinction between the functions ofconception on the one hand\\nandexecution on theother, with the paralleldivision between an\\nemphasis onmentallabourandmanual.

Inthisexample, however, the\\ndifferent stages in the technical division of labouraredistinguished\\nalso bylocationallyrelevantcharacteristics -aboveall by the kind\\noflabourwhich each predominantly needs.Braverman (1974), in\\nhisanalysisof thedevelopment of the technical divisionoflabourin\\ncapitalist economies, pointsoutthatnot only are the operations\\nseparated from each other,butthey are assigned todifferent\\nworkers. An exact parallelcan be drawn here with locations: not\\nonly is there a technical division of labourwithinproduction, but\\nthedifferent stages of it are assigned to different regions. More\\xad\\nover,justas the division oflabourbetween different workers can 72SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nincreaseproductivity and thereby profit, so can its division between\\nregions, by enabling thedifferent stagesofproduction each to\\nrespondmore exactly to their own specific location factors.Spatial\\nstructure , inotherwords, is an active element in accumulation.\\nMoreover , precisely becausegeographical form can influence the\\nrateofaccumulation , it may well be thatoneoftheconditions for\\nthedevelopment ofparticular kindsoftechnical division oflabour\\nwithinproduction in the first place is the existence ofparticular\\nkindsofgeographical differentiation , forinstance in thelabour\\nmarket.Inotherwords, it is not only that\\'thedifferent stages in the\\ntechnical division oflabouraredistinguished bylocationally\\nrelevant characteristics\\' and are therefore spreadout indifferent\\nlocations. Itis alsothatthe very existence ofsuch differences\\nbetween locations may be a stimulus to thedevelopment ofa\\ntechnical division oflabourwhich enables advantage to betakenof\\nthem.?\\nThereare, then, even at the most general level ofanalysis,\\ndistinguishable within this classic spatialstructure twohierarchies ,\\norbundlesof hierarchies, each reflecting different aspectsofthe\\ndivisionoflabourwithin a capitalist society, and each representing\\nadifferent set offunctions withdifferent internal relations of\\ndominance andsubordination .\\n* * *Notallmulti-Iocat ionalcompanies , not even the biggest and most\\nmodern ones, have this kind ofspatialstructure. The way the\\nrelations ofproduction areorganised over space may vary enor\\xad\\nmously both between sectors and between individual firms. Take,\\nfor instance, the case where there is a headquarters /branch-plant\\nstructure but where the whole process ofproduction takes place at\\neach site. The only difference between the plantsisthatone is the\\nheadquarter s and the othersare branches.\\nHere there is one hierarchy only,thatof\\'management functions\\',\\nbroadlydefined. Only the functions of investment ,supervision and\\ncontrolover the production process - the relations ofeconomic\\nownership andpossession - arespreadoutoverspace.The\\nproduction process itself remains geographically undifferentiated .\\nIt may be thatthere is a division oflabourwithinproduction but\\nthat,for one reason or another, thevariouspartsare kept together\\non one site, or it may be thatthere is not a very markedtechnical\\ndivision of labourwithin the process ofproduction underthe\\nownership of a single capital.Incontrast with the part-process Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 73\\nstructure of the last example, this is a case ofwhatmight be called\\nsimple \\'cloning\\'. Examples abound.Medium-sized firms in the\\nclothing industry oftenhave this structure, as domanymulti-plant\\ncompanies manufacturing finalconsumer goodswhich need to be\\nproduced verynearto themarket, largenumbers ofplantssimply\\nbeingreplicated indifferent geographical areas-Coca-Cola\\nbottling plantscometomind.Dual-sourcing is astrategy of\\ncloningadopted for adifferent reason - to guarantee continuity\\nofproduction , usually by undermining thepotential monopoly\\ncontrolof aworkforce in one place over a particular production\\nprocess.\\n* * *As a third example, takewhatisprobably thesimplest spatial\\nstructure of all - the autonomous single-region firm. Here the whole\\nprocessofproduction of acommodity isconcentrated within a\\nsinglegeographical area.\\'Whatever managerial hierarchy exists,\\nandwhatever the division oflabourwithin the processofproduc\\xad\\ntion, it is all locatedwithin one area. Such a spatialstructure is\\nobviously most likely to characterise companies which are small,\\nnotjustin these geographical terms, but also in employment and\\nfinancial terms. CrumandGudgin(1977), for instance,comment on\\nthe fact thatmostBritish-owned companies which are small in\\nemployment terms are confined to one region (para. 275). Such\\ncompanie s are likely also to have a relatively simpleinternal\\nstructure .Theremay be no well developed technical divisionof\\nlabourwithin the process of production ,andlittle in the way ofa\\ncomplex division oflabourwithin the relations ofeconomic own\\xad\\nershipandpossession .Although there is by no meansaone-to-one\\ncorrespondence between the lack of a sufficiently developed tech\\xad\\nnical division oflabourandsmallcompanies ,nonethe less the lack\\nofasignificant division oflabourwithinproduction, since it\\nfrequently implies also a lack ofmajoreconomies ofscale, isoften\\nanenabling condition at least for the survival andcontinued entry\\nof small companies ,andcertainly there isconsiderable empirical\\ncorrespondence between the two.\\n* * *These three examples ofspatialstructures -part-process ,cloning\\nandconcentrated - are set outdiagrammatically inFigure3.3.\\nWhatthe three structures illustrate are three fairly simple cases. In\\nthese clear forms they are unlikely to be found very often\\'in the real\\nworld\\' and the intention is not to set offasearchfor them. The 74 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nexamples are intended toillustrate something ofwhatit means to\\nsaythattherelations ofproduction can bespatially organised in a\\nvarietyofdifferent ways,andindicate ameansby which the\\ncomplexity with which empirical analysis is faced can be ap\\xad\\nproached .Itis easy to think ofnumerous otherpossible struc\\xad\\ntures.Conglomerate ownership, forexample , inwhichthe\\nproduction of a wide range ofdifferent commodities isunderthe\\nsame financial control. Product-cycle structures , where the grip of\\nbothfinancial and scientific controlis relaxed as products mature.\\nOrcombinations -part-process structures combined with dual\\xad\\nsourcing, for instance. And once again it is not legal forms but\\nrealrelations which are crucial. Subcontracting systems can involve\\nonecompany in \\'realownership\\' ofanother, forinstance, or a firm\\nmay be operating in asituation wherepartof thefunctions of\\nownership and possession lie with a bankor financial institution .\\nAll of these potentially represent different structures oftherelations\\nofproduction over space. The pointhere is not to establish an all\\xad\\nembracing typology, but to use a few examples as vehicles for\\nillustrating anapproach .\\nMoreover ,withinthesebroadforms there may be great variation\\nin the way in which each partoftherelations ofproduction is\\norganised spatially.Withinthemanagerial structure there are many\\nways in which the different functions can beorganised ; those of\\neconomic ownership may not form a hierarchy inparallelwith\\nthoseofpossession, for instance.Fashions change, too. The \\'matrix\\napproach\\', pioneered byconsultants in the days of technocratic\\nrationality in the 1960s, is now seen, in the face of undreamt-of\\neconomic difficulties, as overwhelmingly complex and over-formal,\\nand there isa returnto morepragmatic, lessco-ordinated structures\\n(Hunsicker , 1982). Such shifts influence directly the geography of\\ntherelations ofproduction.\\nThe same applies to the production hierarchy. Thereare many\\ndifferent kindsoftechnical divisions oflabourwithinindividual\\nfirms, technical divisions oflabourwhich may be organised into\\ngeographical hierarchies. And they vary widely in their implications\\nfor the patternofemployment andthusfor the structure of\\ninterregional social difference. Figure3.4 gives some examples.\\nThediagram isnotmeanttoimplythatsuchpart-process\\nhierarchies always typify the sectorsnamed,still less thatthe\\ndifferent stages are always separately located.

Again, other technical divisions of labour\\nexist which, although hierarchically organised in terms of flows of\\ninputs, do not have such an obviously hierarchical form in social\\nterms.Part-process plants exist in many industries, and in some\\ncases do not employ distinct kinds of labour.\\nAll these aspects of social relations are integral to the organisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction withincapitalist societies. There is a clear\\ndistinction within such societies between the planned organisation\\nofproduction within each firm and the unplanned market relations\\nbetween them. The development of the technical division oflabour\\nwithin the production of aparticular productincreases the viability\\nofthe individual company in the overall competitive battle. Such\\ndivisions, once evolved, may provide the basis for whole new\\nbranches of production, underseparate ownership.\\nThe emergence of \\'producer services\\', first as a function within\\nthe division of labourinmanufacturing companies and subse\\xad\\nquently as an independent \\'sector\\', is a case in point. Conversely, it\\nis aspartof, and as a result of, such competitive pressures that\\ndifferent patterns ofownership areconstructed .Strategies of\\nvertical and horizontal integration, for instance, undertaken as\\nresponses to competitive pressures resulting from changing macro\\xad\\neconomic circumstances, represent the progressive transfer of parts\\nofproduction, whose relation was previously thatof theunplanned\\nElectronics Vehicles Chemicals Aspects ofthe division of\\nlabour within production\\nconceptualisation/mentalIRandD1 R and D labour; high degree of\\n-,Ijob control\\non-site mixed; some limited\\ncomplex parts components working controlover own labour\\nofproduction in plant process\\nTI execution;rassembly1IassemblyI repetition;\\nmanual labour;\\nno jobcontrol\\nFIGURE3.4Threedifferent part-process possibilities Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 77\\ncompetition ofthemarket,to realcontrolandco-ordination under\\na singleownership . Thedifferent aspectsofthe division of labour\\nwithinproduction reflect each otheranddevelopinrelationto each\\nother.Moreover, boththese facets ofthesocialrelations of\\nproduction haveshownclearlong-term developments. Over the\\nlong term within the development ofcapitalist economies, the\\npressures ofcompetition have led bothto increases in the size of\\nindividual firms and to the incorporation within them ofdifferent\\nprocesses ofproduction ,andto the finer andmorecomplex\\ndevelopment ofthedivision oflabourwithineachindividual\\nprocessofproduction.\\nThis is, then, not a statictaxonomy ofspatialstructures . The\\nemergence ofparticular kindsofspatialstructure willdependon the\\nlevelofdevelopment ofdifferent aspectsoftherelations of\\nproduction. They will only become possible at certainpointsin\\nthe overall development ofcapitalist societies. The tendencies in the\\ndevelopment ofcapitalist economies for the size ofindividual\\ncompanies toincrease, and for multi-plant ,multiregional and\\nmultinational companies to become more common has as its\\ncorollary thatthe significance of the simple-concentration form of\\nspatialstructure will recede. In contrast, thepart-process structure\\nis a relatively late arrivalon the scene.\\nTo talk, however, of\\'the overall development ofcapitalism \\', does\\nnot imply thatallpartsoftheeconomy are at the same stage of\\ndevelopment. Thepart-process structure isnotonly a late arrival,it\\nis also relatively rare and typical only of certainkindsof\\'advanced \\'\\nsectors of production . It by no means typifies even the whole ofthe\\nelectronics industry, nor indeed has it always been a possible spatial\\nstructure , even in this partofthe economy. Forit to become\\npossible it was necessary for specific developments to have taken\\nplacebothin the scope ofindividual companies and within the\\ntechnology ofproduction .Itwas necessary to have companies ofa\\nsufficient size and degree of integration to include within one\\nownership all the stagesfromresearch anddesignto final\\nassembly. These conditions shouldnot be taken for granted: there\\nareplentyofmono-functional companies whichperform only\\nresearch (UK mlh 876), and there are plenty ofsmall firms, within\\nthemanufacture ofindustrial instruments (UKmlh 354) for\\nexample, thatperform the whole range offunctions , but on one\\nsite.Neither ofthesesituations involves the use ofspatial\\ndifferentiation described above. Particular characteristics are also 78 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nrequired ofthetechnology ofproduction. Thepart-process\\nstructure inelectronics has indeed only evolved with the long-term\\ntechnological development of theindustry, andespecially with the\\nemergence and development ofcommodities andcomponents which\\ncan beproduced bymass-production techniques , and with the\\nreinforcement of these longer-term processes by the conditions of\\nfiercercompetition ofthe last twenty years (see, for instance,\\nSaxenian, 1979). It has, indeed, been precisely the conjunction of\\ntechnological andorganisational possibilities which has enabledthe\\nestablishment ofthis form of spatialstructure . And the corollary is\\nalso true. Notall firms with a spatially concentrated, even single\\xad\\nplant,structure aretechnologically backward .Similar spatial\\nstructures can beestablished by verydifferent kindsofcapital.In\\ntheproduction ofscientific instruments, massproduction and\\neconomies ofscale are difficult to achieve (save for certainsmall\\nsubsectors such as the production ofnumerically controlled\\nmachine tools)precisely as aresultofcontinuous technical\\nchange, particularly in thenatureoftheproduct (Oakey, 1978)\\nand themarketing conditions whichfrequently demand individual\\ncustomer specification .\" It may be, however, thatthere is indeed a\\nwell-developed internaldivisionoflabour,butthattheassociated\\nproduction requirements andpossibilities donotlead to a\\ngeographical separation ofthedifferent tasks. This in turnmay\\nresulteitherfrom the lack ofdifferent locational requirements for\\nthedifferent processes or from the organisational structure of\\ncapitalbeingofinsufficient scale or complexity to allow geogra\\xad\\nphicalseparation . Or it may be thatsuch a division oflabourwithin\\nproduction would be technically feasible butthatitsdevelopment is\\nnotencouraged by the existing character ofgeographical differ\\xad\\nentiation . So while there is a tendency for this kind ofspatial\\nstructure to become less important, it is not a unilateral tendency;\\nas was seen in Chapter 2, small firms are not simply a dying breed.\\nAlthough it may decline in overall importance, therefore, single\\xad\\nregionproduction is not aspatialstructure which can beuniquely\\nassociated withold-fashioned capital. Andit isunlikely to\\ndisappear.\\nNeitherareothertendencies all in one direction. Whileelectro\\xad\\nnics has been typified by the spreading outandgeographical\\ndifferentiation ofitsstagesofproduction, themetropolitan\\ncomplexes ofthe chemicals industry represent aconverse process\\noflocational integration. Withinpetrochemicals there is a clear Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 79\\nseries of technical stages within production, theoutputfrom each\\nstage being a different productin the chain (Laurencin et aI., 1977).\\nSometimes theseproducts aremarketed, sometimes they are\\nretained as inputs for the next stage ofproduction (G.Taylor,\\n1979).But whilethere isa clear series ofstages, they are not located\\nseparately. This is the opposite of what has been happening in\\nelectronics, where changes in the natureand degree ofcompetition\\nhavestimulated changes in the organisation ofcapitaland in the\\nprocess of production , allofwhich has both encouraged and\\nenabled locational subdivision . Inpetrochemicals , incontrast,\\nchanges in production concerning inparticular the relative im\\xad\\nportance of different raw materials, and the competitive need for\\neconomies of scale, have encouraged therelocation ofpreviously\\nseparate sites in large groups, or complexes. This process has been\\nfurtherstimulated by two things: firstly, by the fact thatthe\\ndifferent economic and technical stages of production are neither\\na response to nor, once established, responsive to distinctlocational\\nconsiderations ;secondly, because the sites, which would in any case\\nbe large, require such a vast amountofpreparation ,infrastructure\\nand often State aid, thateconomies are attainable by minimising\\ntheir number and grouping different processes together.\\nItis not enough to pointto the stage reached in the development\\nofcapitalist relations in ordertounderstand the complexity of\\nspatialstructures . There is a need also for specific and detailed\\nanalysis of the levelsand forms of development in different parts of\\nthe economy, and of their more specificcauses, which willbe found\\nin an analysis of more immediate conditions - in aparticular\\ndevelopment of managerial structure, perhaps, or a recent merger\\nboom, or a low levelof technological development. But, conversely,\\nneither is it sufficient only to do the more immediate analysis. Itis\\nimportant also to see the particular developments within the\\nbroaderframe of evolving social relations of which they are part.\\nAnd one aspect ofthis,as we have been arguing, is to conceptualise\\nthese\\'geographical patterns\\' in termsofthespatialstructuring of\\nthe relations of production .\\n* * *But why does all this matter? The argument here is that each\\ndifferent kindofspatial structure implies a distinct form ofgeogra\\xad\\nphical differentiation, ofgeographical inequality. This is so in two\\nways - in terms of the structures ofinterregional relations and in\\ntermsofthepatterns ofsocialdifferentiation between areas. 80SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nGeographical unevendevelopment doesnotvary only in degree, as\\nsomeofthearguments aboutincreasing unevendevelopment imply,\\nit varies also in nature.And this variation reflects the plurality of\\nways in whichtherelations ofproduction canbeorganised\\nspatially. Finally, inturn, this way of conceptualising geographical\\ninequality enablesthereformulation ofsome \\'spatial\\' issues at\\npresenton thepolitical agenda.\\nBeforepursuing thisargument, it isimportant to look at one or\\ntwootheraspectsofthesespatialstructures .\\nSome issues\\nTheconcern ofthisbookiswithintranational geographical\\ndifferentiation ,butthisconcern cannotbedivorced fromits\\ninternational context. Acountry\\'sinternal economic geography\\nreflects its place in the international politicaleconomy, theinterna\\xad\\ntionaldivisionoflabour.Itis well recognised thatcountries on the\\nreceiving end ofimperialism , as it were, reflect in their internal\\nspatialstructure theirsubordinate andexternally orientated posi\\xad\\ntion within the world economy. The same applies to metropolitan\\ncountries.Thegeography of\\'Britain the dominant imperialist and\\ntradingpower\\'wasstructured bybooming ,export-based industries\\non the one handand asinkingagriculture on theother.A well\\xad\\nknownattempttopointto possible future developments inFrench\\nregionalgeography startedbytakinganumberofdifferent possible\\nscenarios for theinternational roleofthatcountry as a whole\\n(Michon-Savarit , 1975).\\nIntranational spatialstructures areembedded in aninternational\\nsystem.Itmay bethattheeconomies ofdifferent partsofthe world\\nare \\'specialise d\\'in theproduction ofdifferent commod ities.\\nIncreasingly today,on theotherhand, manyoftheindustries\\nwhich are organised alongpart-process lines, for instance, are\\ninternationalised in terms oftheirproduction facilities. Different\\nnationaleconomies willhave different balancesofthevariousstages\\nofproduction andtheirinternal geography will be affected\\naccordingly .\\nTheelectronics industry is a case in point.TheUnitedKingdom\\noccupies anintermediate position in theinternational spatial\\nstructure ofthisindustry. It is both a location forinwarddirect\\ninvestment in the lower ordersof thepart-process hierarchy , and the\\nsourceofoutward directinvestment. In this it is different from, say, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 81\\nThirdWorldcountries, which tend to have only inwarddirect\\ninvestment, littleownership in theseindustries by localcapital,and\\nconsequently no presence oftheuppertiersofthemanagement\\nhierarchy, andlittle in the upperechelons ofthepart-process\\nstructure either. The inwardinvestment in theUnitedKingdom,\\nmuchofit from the United States but more recently including also\\nfacilities owned by German andJapanese companies, tends to be\\n\\'headless\\', to be lacking the top end of bothmanagement and\\nproduction hierarchies . Even if development (the\\'0\\'ofR andD)\\niscarriedon in the United Kingdom, very often the basic research is\\nnot (Scott, 1974).This, then, tends to give addedweight to the\\nproduction - assembly locations ratherthanto the sites of control\\nandinnovation .Theoutward investment tends to be more balanced .\\nAnumberofBritish owned companies do farm outsome -though\\nnot all- of their humdrum operations tocountries with lower wages\\nthanthose offered in the UnitedKingdom . But there is also some\\ntendency to carryoutadvanced research in the UnitedStates. The\\nState-owned Inmoshasoptedfor thisstrategy, and aconsiderable\\nfractionofthehigh-technology investment in the early years of\\nSilicon Valley was owned by British capital.The net result ofthis\\ncomplex relationto theinternational sectoraldivisionoflabouris\\nprobably thatthespatialstructure established in theUnitedKing\\xad\\ndom, while clearly representative ofall stages ofproduction (in\\ncontrasttothatinaThirdWorldcountry) isunder-represented at the\\ntop endofthehierarchy .ThusthepositionoftheUnitedKingdom in\\nthe overall world capitalist economy is reflected in the geographical\\nstructure andbalanceofthisindustry within the country.\\nThe basic chemicals industry is alsoorganised at aninternational\\nleveland once again each national spatialpatternispartand parcel\\nof aninternational division oflabour.Thenational geography\\ncannotbeunderstood atnational level alone. In chemicals this is a\\nfairlycomplicated phenomenon, but a few pointsare clear. The\\nnon-Rand 0production inFigure3.4 isthatofthe huge chemical\\ncomplexes typical ofthemetropolitan countries where, as we have\\nseen, each ofthemajorstages from refining and the production of\\nbasicproducts through to the main derivatives will usually take\\nplace.Theremay also be a second tier oforganisation linking\\nproduction anddistribution across a numberofdifferent countries .\\nSuch anorganisation exists within the EC, for example, and ismade\\npossible by the vast size oftheindividual companies. Thereis thus\\nlittle by way ofahierarchy - in the sense of a differentiation 82Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbetween sites ofproduction whichcouldform the basis for\\ninequality - either within each of these metropolitan countries or\\nbetween them. Things are different, however, in the division of\\nlabourwhichexists between these countries as agroupand many of\\ntheThirdWorldproducer countries. The latterhave for long often\\nhad little otherthan raw-material production itself. In contrast to\\nthe electronics case this international hierarchy is not a response to\\nvariations in the cost and type of labour. Above all it is a response\\nto the location of raw materials on the one hand and to political\\nrelations between the companies andStates,and between the\\ndifferent States, on the other. Fear of nationalisation of a set of\\nproducts seen as\\'strategic\\' and requiring high levels ofcapital\\ninvestment in their production figureslargely.There is,of course, as\\na result ofdistinct political strategies, considerable variation\\nbetween countries (Laurencin et al..1977), but broadly speaking\\naninternational divisionoflabourat present exists in which most\\nof the physical and economic conditions foraccumulation are\\nconfined tometropolitan countries, andmanyThirdWorld\\nproducer countries lack even the production ofa rangeofbasic\\nproducts.\\n* * *This brings us back to anotherissue. The evolution ofdifferent\\nkindsofspatialstructure, theirestablishment, maintenance and\\neventual col1apse and change, are not simply determined by the\\ncharacteristics ofthelabourprocess, the requirements of accumula\\xad\\ntion, the stages of the mode ofproduction, or even the demands of\\ncapital. None ofthese things in themselves \\'resultin\\' specificspatial\\nforms. Spatial structures are established, reinforced, combated and\\nchanged throughpolitical and economic strategies and battles on\\nthepartofmanagers, workers and political representatives . The\\npresently dominant international divisionoflabourinpetrochem\\xad\\nicalsis now subject to political, backed up by economic, pressure. It\\nisthe object of political struggle.And the outcome willbe the result,\\nnot only of technological and economic requirements and con\\xad\\nstraints, but also of a multi-sided political and economic battle\\nbetween the politics of ThirdWorldproducer countries, interna\\xad\\ntional companies in the sector, and metropolitan State strategies\\n(Laurencin et al.,1977).This isclear at the international level,but it\\nis true also within individual countries.\\nSome of the best examples ofthis can be seen in the conflicts in\\nthe carindustry in recent decades. Many ofthese conflicts have Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 83\\nbeenprecisely overwhatkindofspatialstructure wouldbe\\nestablished . Onedimension ofthetechnical divisionoflabourin\\nthisindustry wasillustrated inFigure3.4.Carproduction consists\\ntechnically ofthemanufacture ofa largenumberofcomponent\\nparts(engines, gearboxes, suspension units,axles) which are then\\nassembled .\\'Thisisrepresented inFigure3.4butwithout any\\nspatialconnotations. Thequestion ishowthisstructure of\\nproduction relations, in terms ofbothownership andtechnology,\\nis to be combined with the form ofspatialdifferentiation which\\nfaces it. Thiscan beboththeobjectandthe result ofconflict.\\nSpatialseparation andvariation have been, in the carindustry, as\\nmuch a partofcapital\\'s strategy againstlabouras have changes\\nwithinproduction . Twocontrasting examples makethis clear. Fiat\\nin Italy, on the one hand,and the companies operating in the\\nUnitedKingdom on theother,havebothattempted toestablish\\nintranational, hierarchical, spatialstructures.\\nFromthe early I970s, andindeedinitiallyfollowing anagreement\\nwith the unionsin 1969, Fiatbegan to restructure itsgeographical\\npatternofproduction within Italy. It was a changewhich was itself\\nallied to a more general realignment ofFiat\\'sposition within the\\nsystemofcarproduction . Oneelementofthatspatialreorganisa\\xad\\ntion was the decentralisation ofpartofthecompany\\'s production\\naway from its traditional base inTurin,to thesouthofItaly. This\\ngeographical shift inturnentailedan explicit processofsegmenta \\xad\\ntionofthe stages ofproduction sothatsomeofthemcouldbe\\nseparated offin adifferent region.Production change and\\ngeographical changewereplanned together. Thepartsofproduc\\xad\\ntion which were decentralised to thesouthweredifferent fromthose\\nremaining in thenorth(Courlet, 1977;Deaglio, 1975).Aboveall,\\nwhatwentsouthwasassembly work,alongwithotherfactories\\nproviding supplies andcertainkindsofsubassemblies andparts.\\nWhatwasestablished, therefore, was apart-process, hierarchical,\\nspatialstructure, with the southat thebottomofthehierarchy .\\nJobstherewereprimarily low-paid anddefined aslow-skilled\\n(Courlet, 1977, p. 273; Deaglio, 1975).Theinterregional difference\\ninproduction jobswasreinforced by the fact thatnoneofthe\\nhighermanagerial, financial andservicefunctions leftTurin.\\nThe new spatialstructure wasfounded oninequalities already\\naccepted within the workforce on the basis ofthetechnical division\\noflabour(thatassembly workerswere classified as less skilled, were\\nless well paid,etc.)andupongeographical differences in the 84SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nworkforce whichenabledevengreaterdisparities to be enforced.\\nTheworkersofTurinwere relatively strongand well organised, and\\ntheir increased militancy is cited by some (Courlet, p. 7) as being a\\nfactorbehind the new locational strategy. Incontrast, theworkers\\nofthesouthwere new to modernindustry and had little experience\\nofunionorganisation. Thesecharacteristics in themselves, however,\\nwere not enough. Therehad been attempts byItalianindustry to\\nusesoutherners before. We saw in Chapter 2thata few years\\nearlier, in the Italy of the fifties and early sixties, southerners had\\nbeendraftedinto theworking classthroughmigration tojobsin the\\nbooming industrial north.\\nIn this earlier period Italianindustry wantedsouthern workers\\nbothbecause, as wehave seen, this was a period of extensive growth\\nand also because in some cases, including Fiat,newlabourwas\\nbeingsoughtto work new machinery . Technical changeand a\\nchangein theworkforce wereimplemented together (Partridge,\\n1980).Fiatran anadvertising campaign in thesouthto entice\\nworkers north,workers who, largely from a poorpeasantback\\xad\\nground,management hopedwould put up with the job\\'sincreased\\nmonotony .Fora while the strategy worked, backedup by\\nencouragement to racism against\\'theMeridionale\\' as a means of\\ndividing the workforce .\\'Inthisperiodtherewasn\\'teven one\\nsouthern foreman - thesoutherners weretreatedas puremachine\\nfodderwithabsolutely no chance ofpromotion\\' (Partridge, 1980,\\np.423).\\nBut it was not to last. We saw earlier thatthe newly arrived\\nindustrial workforce was often in the vanguard ofthe wave of\\nmilitancy at the turnofthe decade. In partit had a lot to do with\\n\\'place\\'. The southerners had come northwith promises ofhigh\\nwages and high standards ofliving. They found themselves caught\\nin themargins of aspiralling urbanisation. They lived in hostels,\\npaidrentsthatate into the higher wages and discovered thatthose\\n\\'higherwagesdidn\\'tgo far with the higher prices ofthenorthand\\ntheaddedexpenses oflaundering andcatering thatyoung\\nunmarried immigrants had to face\\' (Partridge, p. 430).(Southern\\nmales were clearly used to relying on unpaidlabourfor food and\\nclean clothes!) In thatcombination ofindustrial andcommunity\\nconditions, ofwork-life and home-life, what had been a potential\\nweakness turnedtostrength. \\'Lackofindustrial experience\\' can\\nlead to indiscipline as well as to submission. \\'Butthesoutherners,\\nespecially, weren\\'treally used to discipline like the northerners ... Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 85\\nthey talked amongthemselves, sometimes they didn\\'t give a shit ...\\ntheydidn\\'tunderstand anything - but precisely becausetheydidn\\'t\\nunderstand the rules ofFiat,it was really they who began mass\\ndiscussions, who began to breakdiscipline...So Ithinkit was\\nreally the southerners atFiatwith their \"badmanners\"...who\\nstartedto discuss the problems\\' (Parlanti, undated, quotedin\\nPartridge).\\nIt was in the contextof this experience thatFiat\\'smovement\\nsouthbegan.Maybein adifferent geographical setting,home-based\\nin their own region, outof thecompany ofthestudents and the\\nothermanufacturing workers of theindustrial triangle, and with\\nlessstrength in thelabourmarket, southern workers would be\\ndifferent. Thespatialstrategy ofdispersion within the south,\\nmoreover, seemed designed to the same end, reinforcing through\\nisolationoflabourmarketsthe general characteristics ofthe region.\\nWhatFiathadmanaged to do was to combine particular aspectsof\\nthe technical division oflabourwithspatialdifferentiation in the\\nworkforce. Itmanaged toestablish aspatialstructure which was\\nhierarchised in terms bothofadministration andcontrolandof\\nstages and statuseswithinproduction and for a while at least it was\\nsuccessful.\\nBritishcapitalin theUnitedKingdom carindustry has not\\nsucceeded in achieving the same results. Until about1960the car\\nindustry inBritainwasoverwhelmingly concentrated inthewest\\nmidlands and the south-east ofEngland. In 1959, these areas\\naccounted for 72 per cent of totalUnitedKingdom employment\\nin theindustry (Keeble, 1976, p. 181). But in the early sixties this\\npatternchanged considerably with all the majorcar firms setting up\\nnew factories or large plantextensions in thedepressed areasofthe\\ncountry, primarily in Merseyside and in Scotland . In 1959 the\\ndepressed regions - the northofEngland, Wales, Scotland and the\\nnorth-west ofEngland - had only 11.8per centofworkers in the\\ncarindustry in the United Kingdom ; by 1968they had22.4per cent\\n(Friedman ,1977,p.243).The basic reasons for this decentralisation\\nofproduction activity are fairly generally agreed, regional policy\\nandgovernment pressure rankingfirst, but combined with avail\\xad\\nabilityofunemployed male workers (see, for instance, Friedman,\\n1977,p.221;Keeble, 1976,pp.186-7).Whatever the precise\\nbalanceofthese two factors, the factofdecentralisation created\\nthepossibility ofestablishing conditions ofproduction more\\nfavourable tocapitalthanthosewhichexistedin theolder- 86 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nestablished locations. The car workers ofthe west midlands, as we\\nhave seen, were strongly organised and had won for themselves\\ngood rates ofpay and favourable skill ratings (Beynon, 1973,p. 65;\\nFriedman, 1977,pp. 221-4). This local strengthwas aninheritance\\nofdecades and of the long-established importance of engineering in\\nthe west midlands region. One strategy for the car companies was\\nclearly to undermine this strengthsimply by changing location, by\\nmoving outside the geographical reach of this levelof organisation.\\nThe workers in the new areas faced bleak prospects as a result of\\njoblossesin the industries previously dominating those regions, and\\nit wasclearly possible thatsuch gloomy conditions would produce a\\nvulnerable workforce. Certainly anattemptwas made to play upon\\nthese disparities, though to different degrees in the different firms.\\nWages in Ford\\'sandVauxhall\\'s large new factories were quickly\\nbroughtinto line with those in their older factories in the south\\xad\\neast. But Rootes, BMC and Leyland continued to pay far lower\\nrates than in their midlands factories. The difference in approach\\namong the firms reflected wide pay differences between midlands\\nfactories (especially those in Coventry) and those ofthesouth-east\\n(Friedman, 1977,p. 221).6\\nTheattempt toimpose different conditions onworkers in\\ndifferent regions did not confine itself to pay. Friedman points\\noutthatmanagers hoped the \\'vulnerable\\' workers in the new plants\\nmight be \\'moreamenable to managerial initiatives\\' (p. 243),and he\\nquotesChrysler\\'s attemptto initiate Measured Day Work at its\\nLinwood plantinScotland. Theimportance ofthis aspect of\\ncontrolover the workforce, as well as the more obvious money\\ndifferentials, isalso stressed by Beynon (1973)in his examination of\\ntheestablishment ofFord\\'sHalewood factory. Quotingmanagerial\\ndirectives, he pointsoutthatexpansion away from traditional areas\\nmade it possible for the car companies to organise production free\\nof the job controlthathad built up in the old factories:\\'when Ford\\ncame to Liverpool \"restrictive practices\", the activities of shop\\nstewards andmanagerial prerogatives dominated the minds of\\nmanagement and supervision\\' (p. 65). Management and foremen\\nin the new plantwere recruited from Dagenham . Mostofthe\\nlabour,on theotherhand, was \\'green\\' and recruited locally. \\'Many\\nofthemanagement team had been involved in conflicts with\\nsteward organisation atDagenham andweredetermined to\\npreventa similar situation developing at Halewood\\' (Beynon,\\np.65). Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 87\\nThe strategy, however, did not work. Those employed in the new\\nfactories resisted the imposition ofsuch differentials. Fromthe mid\\xad\\nsixtieson, disputes demanding parity between factories, both within\\nand betweencompanies, began to replace disputes over differentials\\nwithin factories as the majorsource of wage grievance in the\\nindustry. A series ofmajor parity strikes in the late sixtiesand early\\nseventiesbegan with a six weeklong dispute in 1966involving 4000\\nworkers at Leyland\\'s Bathgate factory in Scotland over parity with\\nitsStandard-Triumph factory in Coventry. \\'Coventry \\'s high wages,\\nmade more visible because ofthe Coventry Toolroom Agreement,\\nwere held up to employers as a standard for the whole industry in\\nBritain . . . the strategy ofbuilding a periphery ofworkers within\\ncar firms in this country, separated fromCoventry andother\\ntraditional motorareas, began to crumble duringthe late I960s\\'\\n(Friedman, 1977,pp. 221-4).7\\nSimilar battles took place over attempts to establish differentials\\ninshop-floor organisation. At Halewood the policy failed, stimulat\\xad\\ninginsteadmuchconflict. \\'By 1964 a strongshopstewards\\ncommittee had been established in each ofthe three plants on the\\nHalewood estate, and the company had been forced to amend its\\npolicyofrestriction\\' (Beynon, pp. 66-7).\\nTheestablishment ofa spatialstructure, then, isnot justamatter\\nof a simple calculation on the partofcapital. Its success or failure\\ncanbea function also ofworkers\\' ownattitudes and strategies, in\\nthis case their determined resistance. \\'The requirements of capital\\'\\ndo not always have it their own way.\\nThere were also interesting differences between the British and\\nItalian cases. Most importantly, perhaps, in the United Kingdom\\nthe technical division oflabourwas not so clearly co-ordinated with\\nskill difference and spatial separation as itappearsto have been in\\nthe case of Fiat. Both were part-process spatialstructures, but in\\nthe Britishcasethere wasa lesssystematic and clear-cut hierarchical\\nrelationship between technical division oflabourand geography.\\nHalewood and Ellesmere Portincluded majorassembly plants, but\\nthen, as we have seen, Fordand Vauxhall did not succeed in the\\nstrategyofwage-differentials for very long. Certainly it has not\\nbeen the case thatonly lessskilledjobs have gone to peripheral-area\\nlocations. Without thatbasisofdivision, therefore, the way was\\nopen for worker resistance on the basis ofdirect parity claims,\\nbased on identical work, and management\\'s strategy of paying\\nlower wages was, therefore, dependent entirely on the workers in 88SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe new areas being more vulnerable than those in the old. It\\ndepended, inother.words, on management\\'s assessment simply of\\ngeographical differences within the labourforce,ofitsgreater\\nstrength in relation to labourin the depressed areas and on a lack\\nofsolidarity between regions. It was a division based on location\\nratherthanrace, sex or skill (Friedman, 1977,p. 221). It depended\\nentirely upon geographical differences in the strength of otherwise\\nsimilar workers.\\nBut neither were the geographical disparities in the labourforce\\nthe same in the two countries .They were undoubtedly moremarked\\nin Italy, where the contrast was between the organised workers of\\ntheindustrial northand people being draftedin from a rural\\npeasantsociety in the Mezzogiorno. The distance from Turinto\\nNaples is far greater thanthatfromCoventry to Merseyside, not\\njustin terms of kilometres or miles but also in terms of social\\nrelations.\\nThe workers who were recruited on Merseyside and in Scotland\\nwere not green workers in the same way as those of southern Italy.\\nThey may have been vulnerable to thethreatofunemployment, but\\nthey were not without experience of organisation . This was a\\nworking-class area and some of the new recruits had been union\\nworkers. Few, however, had been activists, and Ford\\'srecruitment\\npolicy was designed to keep things thatway. Given the employment\\nconditions elsewhere in the area \\'everybody wanted to go to Ford\\'s\\nbut not everybody was allowed in. Ford\\'shad the pick ofthelabour\\nmarket, and the Company followed a recruitment policy...\\nconsistent with . . . obtaining atrouble-free planton Merseyside\\n...Family men with commitments came first. Stable men who were\\ntied down with debt and responsibility were given priority. Men\\nundertwenty were formally barredand there was little welcome in\\nHalewood for men off the dock or the buildings. Seamen weren\\'t\\nvery high up the list either. Neitherwere the unemployed\\' (Beynon,\\np. 89). Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port operated a\\'pointssystem\\' for\\nrecruitment , based on similar criteria (lWCMotorsGroup,1978,\\np. 11). The aim, in otherwords, was to overcome the potential\\nmilitancy of theworkforce and to reinforce its \\'geographical\\'\\nvulnerability . Beynon reportsa steward recollecting thatit was\\n\\'nota typical Merseyside labourforce at all\\' (p. 89). But it was still\\nin, andpartof, Merseyside.

By the late sixties the\\ncar workers ofScotland and of Merseyside were amongthe best\\norganised and most militantin theUnitedKingdom .\\nCompared with the Italiancase, then, in Britain not only was the\\nattempt at divisiveness more dependent simply on specifically\\ngeographical differences inlabour\\'s strength, butalsothose\\ndifferences, in spite ofmanagerial efforts to reinforce them, were\\nthemselves less marked. Bothmanagement strategy inrelationto\\ngeography , andgeography itself, were different.\\nSuch things are influential , but they are not determinant.It still\\ntook aconscious effortoforganisation (Wright\\'s organisational as\\nopposed tostructural capacities) to buildstrength in the car plants\\nof theperipheral regionsofBritain. And in the factories ofsouthern\\nItaly such effort has eventually been able to overcome thestructural\\ndifficulties and to establish a reputation fororganisational strength.\\nIn the British case certainly, and increasingly in the Italian,\\nlocational separation and thehoped-for effectsofdifferences in the\\nsituation ofworkers, proved to be an insufficient basis on which to\\nestablish furtherdifferences, in wagesand conditions, between those\\nworkers. In the British case it was a locational strategybothwithin\\na singlecountryand between areas all ofwhich had a long history\\nofunionisation, even if not in thatparticular sectorofindustry. In\\nthe years since the failure ofthatattemptwithin one country, many\\nmajorcar firms havemanaged toestablish such differences but on\\naninternational scale,bothbetween metropolitan andperipheral\\nEuropeand between Europeas a whole and the countries ofSouth\\nAmerica and the FarEast. The plantsestablished in the British\\nDevelopment Areas in the sixties operated in acontextwhere there\\nwas essentially a United Kingdom carmarket,with therelationship\\nto the world production andmarketsystemoperating primarily\\nthrough exportsandthrough United States ownership ofgroups\\nwhichoperated asseparate entities. Therewas some degree of\\nmanagerial subordination but little in the way ofaninternational\\npart-process structure . But by the seventies themultinational\\nproducers were well on theirway to establishing atechnical\\ndivisionoflabouratinternational level.Imports to Britain rose\\nsharply, but a sizeable proportion ofthe increase was due to\\nimports byUS/UK manufacturers themselves. In 1982 Ford\\nimported morethanitexported from the United Kingdom\\n(Gooding, 1982). It was a reflection not justofincreasing trade, 90SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nbutoftheestablishment atinternational levelofaspatialstructure\\nwhichincluded thegeographical separation ofdifferent stagesof\\nproduction .Thenextroundofcarplantsin theDevelopment\\nAreas, such as Ford\\'s engine plantat Bridgend, were part-process\\nplantsbutnot for assembly, and they were sited on the basis ofan\\ninternational choiceoflocations .

Once againthenational patternmust be analysed in an\\ninternational context. And inthatwidercontextthe difficulties of\\norganising battlesoverparityare fargreater.Onceagain,geogra\\xad\\nphymatters.\\nAnexample\\nThedevelopment ofthefootwear industry in theUnitedKingdom\\nover the last 200 years illustrates anumberofthese themes. Up to\\nthebeginning ofthenineteenth centurytheindustry was largely\\nconcentrated inLondon. Butaroundthattime rising labourcosts\\nandincreasing militancy amongworkers stimulated amajor\\ngeographical shift.Foster(1974) writes of\\'theeffortsofthegreat\\nLondon contractors (forlong the -controlling powerwithinthe\\nindustry) to sidestep the effects ofwartime wageinflation\\' (p. 85).\\nIn cost terms the contractors were being pressured onbothsides.\\nFormarkets, they relied mainly on exportordersand fixed-price\\npurchasing fromtheArmyandNavy.Theywere,therefore,\\nparticularly vulnerable to rising labourcosts.Thewayoutwhich\\nthey chose was to divertmoreandmoreoftheirordersfrom\\nLondon to thesecondary, provincial centresofproduction in the\\nnorthand,especially, the midlands. Thecrucialdifferences between\\nLondon andtheprovinces lay in the costoflabourandthe\\norganisation oftheworkforces. Theprovincial centres\\'offered\\nnotjustcheapersubsistence but alabourforcethatwasunorga\\xad\\nnised\\'(Foster,p. 85).Theshift in the geographical centreofgravity\\noftheindustry resulted fromwhatFostercalls\\'thisblacklegging\\ndiversion ofwork from London\\' (p. 86).Conversely ,geographical\\nmobility enabledaccumulation tocontinue.\\nNorthampton was one ofthe main centreschosenfor this\\nexpansion .Therewere anumberofreasonsfor this. Therewas, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 91\\nforinstance, aneasily-available supplyofleatherfrom the\\nsurrounding agricultural area. But, as Fosterindicated, perhaps\\nthe most important considerations had to do with labour.The\\nlabourforce here was abundant and it was cheap. Forthe social\\nrelations in agriculture in this area were changing, and this ensured\\naconstant streamoflandless, workless people. The east midlands\\nwas a region where the establishment oflarge-scale commercial\\nfarming came ratherlate, incomparison with the rest ofEngland.\\n\\'In most partsof the region the open field system ofagriculture\\npersisted for a long time - as long as anywhere in England \\xad\\nenclosure not being completed until the early nineteenth century,\\nandcompact villages and well-knit village communities remained\\ntypical\\'(Dury, 1963,p. 363). This was, then, justthe period when,\\nin thispartof England, labourwas being thrownofTthe land and\\nwas therefore abundant. Itwas also cheap, partlybecause of its very\\nabundance and partly, Fostersuggests, because it was \\'probably\\nopen to covert subsidy from the poorrates\\'(p. 85).\\nBut theattraction ofNorthampton was not simply thatlabour\\nwasavailable. but also that labourwas, incontrastto the workers in\\nLondon, completely unorganised into any form ofunion. In part\\nthis was because most of the workers were new to the industry. But\\nalso the fact thatthere was a constant streamofthis surplus labour\\ncoming in from the rural areas to Northampton itself and to the\\nvillages made it likely that the workforce ofthe newly-established\\nfootwear industry would remainunorganised .Northampton did not\\nhaveanything approaching alabourmovement. Itwas not for want\\nof trying. There were a numberofattempts toorganise unions but\\non each occasion it was possible to attractonly a small numberof\\nworkers for any length oftime and \\'fromthe 1830s to the 1850s\\nevery singlestrike in the shoe-making industryseems to have ended\\nindisaster\\'(Foster, p. 102).As Fosterpoints out \\'Giventhenature\\nof the local economy, this of course is justwhat one would expect.\\nThe whole patternofNorthampton\\'s growthdepended on the\\ncheapness of its labour,its lack of militancy and the constant influx\\nof new workers from the surrounding countryside\\' (p.102). He\\nquotes a union organiser, speaking in 1834,early on in this struggle\\nto build a labourmovement. \\'There is no class ofbeing in\\nChristendom thatmore requires the aid of a well-conducted and\\nproperly regulated union than the operative cordwainers of the\\ncounty; they having long been reduced to the lowest stage of\\npoverty, privation and want and far sunk in the black night of 92SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nignorance....\\'(quoted on p. 102). Sixteen years later, by the\\nmiddle of the century, thesituation was much the same. The\\ncontinued influxofpeopledesperate forworkmadeunion\\norganising virtually impossible. According to ajournalist ofthe\\nMorning Chronicle: \\'Thesociety [of shoemakers] hasendeavoured\\nfor some years to keep up the price oflabour,but all their efforts\\nhave been ineffectual. \"Twoorthreeyearssince,\"saidthe\\nsecretary, \"westruckin one of the shops in the town. It was no\\nuseourholdingout for the scabs from the countrywent in and\\nfetched the work for whatever price the mastersliked to give\"\\n(quoted inFoster,p. 103). Indeed, by this time, insteadof\\nfunctioning in the main to improve the pay and conditions of\\nworkersin its own area,as might be expected in a locality where the\\nindustry had now been well established for some decades, the\\nNorthampton shoemakers\\' societyoperated mainly as a tramping\\norganisation which helped its members find work in otherpartsof\\nthe country! \\'Inall this the rootproblem was clearly a labour\\nmarketthatstretched far beyond the town itself and included (as a\\nresultofthe rural clearances) a pauperized massoflabourwilling to\\ndoalmostanything to getwork\\'(Foster,1974, p. 103).\\nNow, as the industry established itself in the Northamptonshire\\narea, ittookon aparticular spatialstructure, and this too, like the\\nweakness ofthelabourforce, was a direct function ofexisting,\\nwider social relations.Itwasduringthemid-nineteenth centurythat\\noneimportant aspectoftheorganisation ofproduction in the\\nindustry wasestablished which has remained ever since and which\\nhas affected both labour-movement organisation andlocational\\nstrategy. A system developed whereby men were employed direct by\\ncapital,on a factory basis in the town or village, to make shoes.\\nVery frequently, however, the men would in turn farm outto\\nwomen the \\'closing\\' process - stitching the uppers on to the soles.\\nThe women were subcontracted labourandworked athome,\\nmainlybasedin the\\'compact villages andwell-knit village\\ncommunities\\' whichDuryreferred to as still being so important\\nin the area around Northampton. Withintheindustry a sexual\\ndivisionoflabourthus developed which reflected social divisions in\\nthe world outside- and in particular theconfinement ofwomen to\\nthe home. New relations ofproduction, a sexual division oflabour,\\nandalocalinternal spatialstructure werethusestablished\\nsimultaneously. UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 93\\nLater in the nineteenth century, however, pressure fromimports\\nincreased and capitalin theindustry wasagainfaced with the need\\nto cut costs. \\'Onceagain,therefore, with no help from machinery,\\nand with wages alreadydown to subsistence level,some furtherway\\nhad to be found ofmaintaining profitability\\' (Foster, p. 86). The\\nsolutionadopted this time was to changethe social relations within\\ntheindustry and, aspartand parcel ofthis, once more to alterits\\nspatialstructure . Themajorshift was a massive expansion in the\\ndirectemployment bycapitalofwomen and children infactories in\\nthe town ofNorthampton itself. By the middle of the centuryover\\nhalfthewage-labour forceoftheindustry in theareaconsisted of\\nwomen and children. \\'Thelarger social importance ofthis was not\\nso much their employment itself (they had to some extent been\\nemployed at home before) as the fact thatthey were now employed\\ntogether, undersupervision , in the town centreworkshops\\' (Foster,\\np. 86). This shift in boththe social and the spatialorganisation of\\ntheindustry had afurthergeographical consequence. Along with\\ntheincreasing severity of the poorlaws itencouraged a mass influx\\nofimmigrants, this time from the surrounding villages to the town\\nitself. \\'Where previously shoemaking families had been able to work\\nwithout difficulty in quite distantvillages, they now had to be\\nwithin daily reach of the town\\'sclosingshops\\'(Foster,p. 86). The\\nby-now established sexualdivision oflabourin theindustry,\\ncombined with the fact that women continued to beresponsible\\nfordomestic labourin the home and therefore were unable to travel\\nfar to work outsidethe home, meantthatachangein the social\\nrelations inproduction (the establishment ofthe closing process on\\na factory basis) had considerable geographical implications. The\\nchanging organisation ofproduction and the stubbornly unchan\\xad\\ngingrelations between the sexes together accelerated the process of\\nurbanisation in thenineteenth-century eastmidlands ofEngland.\\nBy1851Northampton\\'s population had reached 26,000 and almost\\none in two ofits families were dependent on the shoe industry.\\nInside the production process theprevious division between\\nfactory and domestic (closing) organisation wasformalised as two\\nseparate stages of production ,performed bydifferent groupswithin\\ntheworkforce , butbothnowoperated on afactorybasis.Labour\\ncosts were reduced at this stage, not by a changein the kind of\\nlabourwhich was used, nor by a change in production technique\\n(for the work ofclosing the shoe remained exactly as it had been 94 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nwhenperformed in the women\\'s own homes) but by a change in\\nproduction relations. This enabled the more direct enforcement of\\ndiscipline over the actualwork process: controlover the time,\\namountand pace ofwork for each individual worker. This change\\neventhoughit was confined to something asapparently intangible\\nas \\'social relations\\' intumhadmajorand immediate implications\\nfor the spatial organisation ofproduction in the industry.\\nBut while production relations and social structure underwent\\nmajorchanges, the sexual division oflabour,established initially\\nbecauseof\\'theplace of women in the home\\', became more firmly\\ninscribed in the organisation oftheindustry. From now on, men\\ndidcutting(clicking), women did closing (see also Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982).It was a social allocation ofdifferent kinds of\\nworkers to different stages in the process of production, and along\\nlines of division accepted within and by the workforce, which was\\nbased on a sexual division oflabourin the wider society, and taken\\nup and thereby reinforced within production .Itwas to have further\\nimplications for the spatial structure oftheindustry.\\nFirst of all, it played an important role in the course oflabour\\nrelations within the industry. The level of labourmilitancy in the\\nfootwear industry hasremained low. The two mainunions\\n(NUFLAT and the Rossendale Union) are seen by the employers\\nthemselves as moderate andaccommodating . Areportby the\\nEconomists Advisory Group(undated) commented that\\'workers\\nin theindustryareorganised into two industrial unionsratherthan\\non a craft basis. EAG believes thatthis ismost satisfactory and is a\\npartialexplanation ofthe generally good industrial relations in the\\nindustry....We consider thatthe present union leadership is\\nawarethatbadindustrial relations could cripple the footwear\\nindustryat a time when it is already vulnerable\\' (p. 133).\\'Evidence\\nof the fairly moderate attitudeof the unions at local level\\' is then\\ndetailed. The importance ofthis union amenability was revealed\\nwhen employers readily agreed to a closed shop in the industry.The\\nquid pro quo for this seems to have been twofold. First, it was a\\ndeterrent to theunions\\'being taken over by a more general union,\\nwhich might be more militant: \\'The introduction of the closed shop\\ninMarchthis year will significantly increase the two unions\\'\\nmembership and funds . . . . This strengthening ofthe unions is\\ndesirable to the extent thatit makes them less vulnerable to take\\nover by some otherunion. We doubtwhetherofitself it will make\\nmuch change in relations within the industry\\' (Economists Advisory Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 95\\nGroup,undated, p. 133).Second, the sexual division oflabourwas\\nretained: \\'We are unaware ofany restrictive practice in the industry\\nsave two which are so glaringasapparently not even to be\\ndescribed as such by managers in theindustry; therestriction of\\nclicking to men and ofclosing to women. We do not accept that\\nthere is any aspect ofeitheroperation which precludes the use of\\neithersex. We doubtwhether thiscustom conforms to the\\nrequirements ofrecent sex discrimination legislation\\' (p. 134).It\\nstillcontinues to exist in practice, however.\\nThis sexual division oflabourstill has effects on the geography of\\ntheindustry. Muchofthefootwear industry in the United Kingdom\\ntoday is located in the small towns and villages ofregions such as\\nthe eastmidlands and East Anglia. But these are regions to which,\\nsince the Second World War, otherfemale-employing industries\\nhave begun to decentralise. This has meant competition forlabour\\nand pressure on wages. Women\\'s wages in the industry have been\\npushed up. Such changes have not been takingplace in the market\\nfor male labour(though inabsolute terms men\\'s wages remain\\nhigher than women\\'s). This differential availability (at those wages)\\nofmale and female labourhas led to an increasing degree of\\ngeographical separation between the two stages ofproduction: a\\nnew spatial structure. TheEconomists Advisory Groupreportsthat\\ntheshortageofclosers (women) has necessitated the establishment\\nofclosingroomsawayfromthemainfactory (p. 134). In other\\nwords,a social division ofjobsbetween workers, which has\\nabsolutely no technical basis in the present form of organisation\\noftheindustry, continues to influence its spatialstructure . It is a\\nstory we shall take up again in Chapter 4.\\nIn thefootwear industry in Britain today, then, it is not justthat\\nthere isa variation in the balance ofemployment between men and\\nwomen in different areas. Divisions which have been established\\nwithin the organisation ofthe process ofproduction itself have been\\na necessary precondition for these variations in thegeographical\\npatternofemployment. Butneitherhas it been true thatthe\\ntechnical division oflabouritself, or the natureofthelabour\\nprocesses within the industry, have been the determinant ofthe kind\\noflaboursoughtbycompanies in theindustry. Theallocation of\\ndifferent groupsofpeople to different jobshas had more to do with\\nsocial and ideological structures established outsidethe factory than\\nwith any requirements of thelabourprocess itself. And \\'place\\' has\\nbeenimportant in the history oftheindustry too. The spatial 96SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nseparation ofhome and work reinforced the initial sexual-social\\ndivisionoflabourwithinproduction . The wider characteristics of\\ntheregionand its\\' social organisation , and in particular the\\nnineteenth-century changes in agriculture , have left their markon\\nunionorganisation within the industry. Such were the problems\\nposed by the continual influx of new workers that,to refer back to\\nWright\\'s terminology , theorganisational attempts made within the\\nindustry were powerless in the face ofthe lack ofstructural\\ncapacities, inthiscaselargelytheproduct ofthekindof\\ngeographical area in which the industry was located. The relation\\nbetween the technology ofproduction , social conflicts and defini\\xad\\ntionswithinandoutside thefactory, andgeographical form\\ncontinues to be one ofmutualinteraction and determination.\\n3.3Spatialstructures of production and geographical inequality\\nNot two-dimensional patterns, but underlying relations\\nThegeographical organisation ofproduction can, then, be con\\xad\\nceptualised in terms of the spatialstructure oftherelations of\\nproduction . And if this is so then what are often referred to as\\n\\'interregional relations\\' are also a reflection of the spatialstructure\\noftherelations ofproduction . Thenotionof\\'spatialrelations\\', in\\nthis sense, refers to the fact thatone function in the organisation of\\nproduction isoperating between two different places. While other\\nfunctions operatein a single location it is at this pointwithin the\\ndivision of labourthatspatialseparation iscombined with the\\naspatialdivision of tasks. Different regions have allottedto them, in\\ndifferent spatialstructures, particular bundlesoffunctions within\\nthe overall relations ofproduction .Itis what is often referred to as\\n\\'theroleofthe region\\' in the countryas a whole.\" And this in turn\\nmeansthatthegeography ofdominance andsubordination can take\\nmany forms. Fordifferent spatialstructures -different waysof\\norganising therelationsofproduction over space - can then be seen\\nto imply very different kinds of \\'interregional relations\\' .Different\\nwaysoforganising capitalist production underlie, and lead to,\\ndifferent kindsof\\'regional problem\\' .\\n* * *Thespatialstructure characterised by thelocational concentration\\nofownership andproduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 97\\nany sortofinterregional relations ofdominance andsubordination.\\nThetotalspanoffunctions ofrealownership and possession and\\nthe full range of production activities underanyindividual owner\\xad\\nship are present within each region. All \\'planned\\' relations, thoseof\\ndirectcontrolwithin a firm, are intraregional. And allinterregional\\nrelations consist of \\'unplanned\\' markettransactions between firms\\nor between firms,and consumers. It is,moreover, at least in some\\nlogical sense possible for every region to have exactly the same\\nmixture and spreadoflocally-owned production . This logical sense,\\nhowever, is one which considers only the formal range ofpossible\\npatterns, ratherthan the mechanisms of their production. Such\\nidyllic pictures ofbalance and equal exchange do not, ofcourse,\\nhave many historical referents. Historically, this form of spatial\\nstructure has been associated with specialisation anddifferentiation ,\\nand unequal marketrelations.\"\\nInparticular , in so far as this use ofspace has been associated\\nwith regional differences, it has most usually been one based on\\ninterregional relations structured aroundindustrial spatialconcen\\xad\\ntration.The role which any region plays within the larger system is\\nthus defined by its sectoral contribution orspecialisation . This was\\nthedominant situation ininterwar Britain, analysed by Carney,\\nLewis and Hudson(1977).Thereare anumberofways in which\\nsuchindustrial differentiation between regions can produce a\\nstructure ofinterregional subordination and/orinequality. Much\\nofthe history of capitalist societies so far has consisted ofthe\\nopening up, domination andsubsequent desertion ofareasby\\nparticular industries . The kind of dependence which can exist in\\nsuch cases is, ofcourse,structural (meaning sectoral) dependence \\xad\\n\\'over-representation\\' in theproduction ofparticular commodities\\nor ranges ofcommodities. Theemployment structure ofsuch areas\\nmay become heavily dependent on thefortunes ofparticular\\nindustries , and at any particular historical moment some will be\\nleading and otherslagging in the process ofeconomic growth. In\\ntermsofthis useofspace, it is sectoral concentration - the kind of\\ncommodities produced - which is likely to differentiate regions one\\nfromanother, and which defines their role within the overall\\nregional system.\\n* * *This form ofinterregional distinction does not characterise either\\nthe cloning or the part-process spatialstructures. In both these\\nlattercases all the regions in the system may have exactly the same 98SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nindustrial structure, andconversely anyindustry maybepresentin\\nall regions. Whatdistinguishes the regions in a case like this is their\\nrelationto a single unitofownership . Inboththese cases even an\\nequaldistribution ofindustries wiIIbeassociated withinequality,\\nwithinterregional relations ofdomination andsubordination. But\\nthereare also significant differences between these two spatial\\nstructures . Inboth,branchplantsaresubjecttoexternalownership\\nandcontrol,but in the part-process structure , where there is botha\\nmanagerial hierarchy andgeographical separation ofstagesof\\nproduction, regions\\'lowerdown\\'thehierarchy willbesubjectto\\nbothexternal ownership andproduction-dependence, andthe\\neffectsofthese two forms ofsubordination are very different.\\nTakefirst the case of the cloningspatialstructure . Here it is only\\ntherelations ofeconomic ownership andpossession which are\\ndisaggregated over space. In otherwords,theproduction activity\\xad\\nitself the same in all regions - is in the non-headquarters region\\nultimately subordinate toadministrative andfinancial control\\nlocatedoutsidethe region. Itis this which has cometobereferred\\nto as \\'the problemofexternalcontrol\\', \\'theproblemofthebranch\\xad\\nplanteconomy\\', andas such is reputed to have all kindsof\\nundesirable effects.Conceptualised moreprecisely, however, what\\nexternal controlreallymeansisthat,in theseregions,certainparts\\nof thefunctions ofeconomic ownership andpossession are missing.\\nAndconceptualised like this, someofitseffectslookrather\\ndifferent.\\nOnecommonly-cla imed effect ofexternal ownership is the\\nleakageofprofitsfrom the region ofproduction to the region of\\ncontrol.Thecomplaint isthatexternal controlleads to remissions\\nofprofitto aparentplantfrom where it need not bereinvested in\\nthe region oforigin. In its usual form this is a complaint which is\\noverstated andmisforrnulated.!\" Whatare at issue are the relations\\nandfunctions ofeconomic ownership. Fulleconomic ownership\\nconsistsofcontrolover the overall investment andaccumulation\\nprocess.Itis the loss ofthisfunction which leads to the likelihood\\noftheleakageofprofitandinvestment funds from the region. But\\nwhatdoes\\'theregion\\' mean?Thereisusually animplicit\\ncomparison with times gone by, yet in fact neither\\'theregion\\'as\\nanentity,whatever thatwould be, northedirectproducers within\\nit, ever had control, undercapitalist relations, overprofitsand\\ninvestment. Theusualargument putsthefocusentirely on\\ngeographical location to thecomplete exclusion ofclasslocation. Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 99\\nEven with geographically localownership ofproduction such\\nprofitscouldbewithdrawn from\\'theregion\\'andinvested else\\xad\\nwhere.Regionally-based capitalis not necessarily regionally \\'loyal\\';\\nindeed, given thatit isreasonably enterprising, it would be foolish\\nto be so. Here the social natureandorganisational structure of\\ncapitalisimportant. Certainly ownership bylargerandalready\\nmulti-regional companies will goalongwithincreasing geographical\\nflexibility and mobility.Thereare likely to behigherleakages of\\nprofit,therefore, butit is not by any means a new phenomenon\\nintroduced byexternal ownership. Nordoes the solution to the\\nproblem lie inspatialredistribution - in a fairer distribution of\\ncapitalists between the regions of a country-butin achangein, not\\njustthegeographical, but also the social locationoffulleconomic\\nownership.\\nThisreformulation ofwhatthequestion ofexternal ownership is\\nabout,inotherwords,changes also the political question -what\\ndoes it mean politically tocomplain ofexternalcontrol? Oneofthe\\nrecent policy responses in theUnitedKingdom ,partlyto this issue\\nand,conveniently, to the fact thatbig,multi-regional firms are no\\nlongerasourceofso much new employment , has been an emphasis\\non asmall-firm strategy;\\'backing localbusiness\\', \\'encouraging local\\nentrepreneurship\\' . As aresponse to the simple complaint ofexternal\\ncontrolthisstrategy is perfectly adequate, butittherebyprecisely\\nshows up the dangersof such a complaint. Forit failscompletely to\\nattackthedeeperissue, the combination ofgeographical andsocial\\ncontroloverinvestment. Even in the (unlikely) eventofsuch\\nstrategies succeeding, in terms ofthegrowthoflocalcontrol,that\\ncontrolwould simply mean the emergence orre-emergence of a\\nlocalcapitalist class.Foranything whichcouldmeaningfully be\\ncalled local control, reorganisation is needed not justofthespatial\\nbutalsoofthe social form oftherelations ofproduction. Itis a\\nfunction, not a class, which shouldbe reclaimed.\\nButthatraises afurtherissueaboutwhat\\'control\\' means in this\\ncontext. It isoftenarguedthatoneofthemajoreffectsofexternal\\nownership isthatit leaves the plantor locality \\'atthe mercy of\\nexternal forces\\'. Again, however, is this really new? Itwasexternal\\nforces - the external forcesofthemarketandofchanging\\ninternational relations - which laid waste the coalfields ofBritain\\nin the early partof thetwentieth century. Whatisdifferent isthat\\n\\'blame\\' can now be laid at an identifiable door- inDetroit, in New\\nYorkor inLondon. The locus ofresponsibility is nowpersonified. 100SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nInstead of suffering directly from the unplanned relations of the\\nmarket,people working in a branch plantexperience them through\\nthe mediation of plannedrelations within a company. But to see\\nthatas somehow \\'worse\\'than the previous situation is to blame\\nindividuals while accepting as inevitable the operation ofmarket\\nforces.Itis to givecredence to the marketas \\'natural\\', to accept in\\notherwords one of the fundamental underlying ideological tenets of\\ncapitalist social relations.\\nWhere, anyway, does \\'control\\' lie? It does not lie in individual\\npersonnel (in spite of the very real and considerable degree of\\nautonomy exercised by large corporations, and the degree of\\ncontrolover the marketconferred by monopoly power) but in the\\nwider relations of which they are part.Toreturnto an earlier\\ndiscussion, the personal qualities of a Henry Ford,a Michael\\nEdwardes or an Ian MacGregor, are not negligible in their effect\\noncompany behaviour but they have their effects within their\\nhistorical times. NeitherEdwardes nor MacGregor is likely to\\nrevive, single-handed, the production of cars or ofsteel. The logic\\nof economic forces does not determine the precise response of\\nindividual managers or of different types of companies, but neither\\nis action simply taken in a vacuum. Itisa response to something, to\\nwiderconditions of which those companies and managements are a\\npart.\\nAndthat, too, has its implications for policy. If real control, in\\nthatultimate sense which would be restricted by circumstances not\\nbeing of one\\'s own choosing, liesoutside the relations of production\\nin an individual firm, it follows thatit is not only insufficient to\\nchange the geographical location of control,it is also insufficient to\\nchange its class location if all thatmeans is thatdifferent people\\ntake over. A profit -oriented co-operative in a sea of marketforces\\nmay have all kinds of othersocial and political advantages, but it is\\nno less subject to the \\'external forces\\' of the marketthan is the\\nstraightforward capitalist firm. To get real local controlover\\nemployment it is necessary also to remove production from the\\nplayofmarketforces.Itis notjustthatthe claim should be for\\nfunctions of controlratherthan for a new breed of local business\\npeople, but thatthe functions too must be redesigned.They cannot,\\nif localcontrolis to be real, remain simply as defined by the wider\\nstructure of capitalist relations.\\nSome effects of thatbroad,descriptive thing \\'external control\\'\\nhave, then, perhapsbeenoverestimated or misread. They are real, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 101\\nbut in forms, and with political implications, ratherdifferent from\\nthosecommonly adduced.\\nThereareothereffects too, also more easily interpreted when\\nexternalcontrolisconceptualised - andtherefore disaggregated - in\\ntermsofgeographically absentfunctions within the overall relations\\nofeconomic ownership andpossession .\\nFirst,branch plants may have lower local multipliers thanwould\\nbe the case if the whole enterprise werelocatedin one place. This\\nresultsfrom the loss to the headquarters regionofthemore\\nstrategic functions ofpossession, in otherwords from the centra\\xad\\nlisation of majorpurchasing functions dealingbothwithcapital\\ninvestment andwith services, particularly the whole rangeof\\nbusiness services. Ithas been found in a numberofstudiesthat\\nsuchfunctions may be missing from branchplantsandthatthatin\\nturnmay mean a lower proportion ofpurchases being made locally\\n- hence the lower local multiplier effects. The importance ofsuch\\neffects is open to empirical investigation and willcertainly vary, for\\ninstancedepending onwhetherthemarketareas for such goods and\\nservices would in any case be constrained toregional or local level.\\nTo the extent thatsuch an effect does result, however, it has a\\nnumberofimplications. It reduces the potential propulsive effectof\\nStateregional policies designed to attractinto declining regions\\ninvestment by multi regional andmultinational capital. And it\\nimpoverishes the level ofintegration ofa localeconomy, reducing\\nit to a collection ofisolatedproduction units with little connection\\nineconomic terms to each other.Bothofthese may make it more\\ndifficult to providethemomentum for\\'self-sustaining growth\\'in a\\nregion.\\nBranch-plant economiescan be a problem inotherways, too, for\\nthose who work in them. Branch-plant statusmay greatly increase\\nthedifficulties facingtradeunionnegotiators -andhere the\\nproblems areexacerbated if theheadquarters isabroadand not\\nmerely in anotherregionofthe same country. The difficulties are\\ntwofold. Above all, local management, low down the management\\nhierarchy but stillrequired to sit across the negotiating table, may\\nsimply not have the functions and levels ofcontroland responsi\\xad\\nbility which are being bargained over.Thosefunctions are located\\nelsewhere. Further, where the branchplantispartofa cloning\\nstructure, or where there is any degree ofdual-sourcing ,itis all too\\neasy for management tothreaten toplayoff oneplantagainstits\\nduplicate elsewhere. 102SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nThese, then, are some ofthecharacteristics andproblems ofthe\\nabsence from a locality with only branch-plant statusofsomeofthe\\nhigher-level functions ofeconomic ownership and possession. They\\nareattributes, therefore, which will characterise , to one degree or\\nanother and in some form or other,allbranch-plant formsof\\norganisation. They will characterise boththe cloning and the part\\xad\\nprocessspatialstructures.\\n* * *While in the cloning structure itis\\'only\\'these functions ofownership\\nand possession whichare removed from the branch-plant location, in\\nthepart-process structure branchplantsaredoublypenalised. Not\\nonly aremanagerial functions removed but soalso are wholesections\\nof the wider technical division oflabourinto which the plantis\\nembedded. Notonly is the plantsubordinated to anexternalised\\nhierarchy ofownership and possession, it is also subject to what\\nmight becalled \\'production dependence\\' .And the effects ofthis kind\\nofdependence arequitedifferent, andhavedifferent political\\nimplications, from those ofexternalownership alone.\\nFirst, thepart-process structure isalso likely to result in low local\\nmultipliers in thebranch-plant regions, but the reasons for this, and\\ntheimplications, are very different from those which result from\\nexternal ownership alone. To begin with, the cause is different. In\\nthis case the lack ofeconomic relations with the local economy\\nresults not from the centralisation ofordering procedures and\\ndecisions at head office but from the fact thattheactualmaterial\\nflowsofinputsandoutputsto theplantwill come from and go to\\notherplantswithin the same corporate structure. A factory or office\\nisjustone stage in the company\\'s production ofthecommodity .\\nThis means thatwhileexternal ownership may affect service links\\nmore than material ones (because of its relation to the functions of\\ncontrol),part-process dependence overwhelmingly affects material\\nlinkages (precisely because ofthenatureoftheplant\\'sinsertion into\\nthespatialstructure). Because external controldoes not require\\nproduction dependence butproduction dependence doesentail\\nexternal control, one would expect that, when\\'branchplants\\' are\\nconsidered as anundifferentiated category, service links will be\\nmore affected thanmaterial ones.ThusMarquand\\'s survey (1979)\\nfindsthatthe effect ismore marked, whenbranchplantsas a whole\\nareconsidered, in service than in manufacturing linkages. On the\\notherhand, studies ofindividual sectors whose forms ofspatial\\norganisation includeproduction dependence (e.g. some partsof Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 103\\nelectronics, andcars)oftenhavealmostno local material linkages.\\nThisdifference alsomeansthattheeconomic isolation ofplants\\xad\\ntheirlackofconnection to the local region- is likely to be much\\nstronger in the case ofpart-process dependence thaninthatof\\nexternal ownership alone.Plantswhichareembedded inboth\\nmanagerial andpart-process hierarchies reallyare\\'cathedrals in\\nthedesert\\'.Again,as withexternal control, apart-process structure\\nwillmakelifedifficult fortradeunionsandworkerorganisations,\\nbutagainthereasonsaredifferent fromandadditional tothose\\nwhichresultfromexternal ownership alone.Oneobvious reasonis\\nthatin apart-process structure localsympathetic actionbyworkers\\ninnearbyrelatedplantsandindustries may be moredifficult to\\norganise.Theveryisolation, thelinkageintocorporation rather\\nthanregion,willmeanthattherearefew, ifany,nearbyplantsand\\nindustries whicharerelated.\\nFinally, apart-process structure willmakemoredifficult any\\nattempts at local takeover andtheestablishment ofautonomous\\nproduction .Nowit may be askedwhatis thedifference between a\\nwholeseriesofplantsownedbydifferent companies butproviding\\neachotherwithinputs,andtheproduction hierarchies ofapart\\xad\\nprocessstructure? Are they notjustallpartofthegeneraldivision\\noflabourwithinsociety? In fact not;forplantsin apart-process\\nhierarchy aresubjectto anadditional kindofdependence.

As such the\\nplantcannot soeasilybeestablished as aseparate pointof\\nproduction ofprofit; it is less easy to takeoverandrun as a\\nlocally-autonomous entity.\\nObviously much,too, will dependon thetechnical natureofthe\\nproduction process, on thedegreetowhichthecapitalequipment is 104 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nparticular to theindividual product, but in general terms exactly the\\nsamecontrasts apply incomparison with a simple cloning structure .\\nThe high degree ofspecification ofproduction itself to a particular\\nbroaderstructure entailedin apart-process spatialformsubstan\\xad\\ntially increases the difficulty ofany moves towards localcontrol,\\nwhether in the form of nationalisation, where the interregional\\ndependence is alsointernational, or in the form ofworkers\\' control.\\nWithproduction dependence, it isnot only full economic ownership\\nwhich is missing - a situation rectifiable by takeover - but the\\nbroader productive structure as apartof which the particular\\nfactory has been planned.\\n* * *Eachofthe three spatialstructures, then, can be the basis for a\\ndifferent setofinterregional relations and form of interregional\\ndependence . In each ofthe three cases justlooked at the individual\\nregions play different kindsof\\'roles\\'within the overall system. So it\\nmattersin what kind ofspatialstructure aplantisembedded. It\\nmatters intermsofthekindofrelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination which exist between plantsindifferent localities, it\\nmattersfor the people who work in the plants,and itmatters\\npolitically.\\nItalsomattersmethodologically andconceptually. Oneofthe\\nunderlying themes implicit in all this is thatit isimportant to get\\naway from discussions ofapparently simple\\'objects\\', andto\\nconceptualise processes and relations. Objects are not simply given\\nto analysis, but are themselves products, and must be conceptua\\xad\\nlised in such a way as to incorporate, notjusttheir descriptive\\ncharacteristics, but also the process of their production, the larger\\ndynamic ofwhich they are part.Thenotionof\\'branchplant\\'is a\\ngood example. Itisprobably fair to say thatthephenomenon of\\n\\'branchplants\\'is too often treatedeitheras anunproblematical and\\nundifferentiated category, or asdifferentiated onlyaccording to\\nmanagerial preference, currentfashions in corporate organisation\\nor descriptive dimensions such as size.12There clearly are interfirm\\ndifferences in branch-plant autonomy, etc., which do depend on\\nsuch factors, and which do have effects. Whatisimportant is also\\ntoconceptualise thedifferent rolesbranchplantscan play in terms\\nofthedifferent spatialstructures in which they are embedded and\\nthedifferent larger processes and relations which they reflect. The\\ncontrast between branchplantsin apart-process hierarchy and\\nthose in a simple cloningstructure is an excellent case in point.The Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 105\\npossible differences in levels ofservice and material linkages have\\nalready been referred to, and there may be otherdistinctions. For\\nwhile the first kind ofbranchplantrepresents one stage of\\nproduction , the second represents additional capacity for all stages\\nofproduction. Thischaracteristic might lead the two types of\\nbranchplantto have very different relativepropensities to closure\\nduringdownturns in economic activity. Closures or reductions in\\ncapacity in branch plants in the part-process structure could not\\nreally take place withoutotherproduction locations experiencing\\nsimilarcutbacks (this does not, of course, apply to Rand0\\nfacilities). Such branchplantsdo not in any way perform the\\nfunction offlexible extra margins tocapacity. Itis, however,\\nprecisely this function which is played by branchplantsin the\\ncloning spatial structure and it is this kind ofbranchplantwhich\\none would expect to be more vulnerable toclosurein business\\ndownturns . There has been considerable debateover the years over\\nwhether ornot\\'branch-plant economies\\' aremoreliableto\\nemployment cutbacks andfluctuations because ofahigher\\npropensity to closure. Itwould certainly be worth investigating\\nwhether an analysis oftheir distinct roles within different spatial\\nstructures affects the implications for recipient regions ofnew\\nemployment with a high branch-plant component. A more analy\\xad\\nticaldistinction along these lines might help to throwlight on the\\napparently conflicting empirical evidence, and perhapsevenpoint\\nto avariation over time as different kinds of\\'branchplant\\'became\\nmorecommon.\\nThese examples oftheconnection betweenspatialstructures and\\nspatialrelations could be multiplied. A conglomerate formof\\nenterprise structure, forinstance, isdifferent again,and has\\ndifferent implications .Inthis case the specifically intersectoral\\nnatureofownership may, as a result ofthe kindofcharacteristics\\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2, Characterising capital)add a\\nfurtherdegreeofvulnerability becauseofgreaterflexibility of\\ninvestment. Inthe caseofsubcontracting, the technical division of\\nlabour,and the overall production process, is underthecontrolof\\none firm which sends out certainstages, or partsofcertainstages,\\ntoothercompanies . Thus the legal independence oftheproducing\\ncompany is nullified by the actual controlofmany aspects of\\nownership and possession by the larger enterprise , while the form of\\ntheproductmaybeinfluenced by its defactosubordination into a\\npart-process hierarchy. The effects ofthis in terms ofdependence 106SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nandpotential instability ofemployment are well known. Subcon\\xad\\ntractingmay also take on a systematic spatialform. Pedersen (1978)\\nanalyses such a situation inDenmark , and its relationto regional\\ninequality . The three examples being used here are to illustrate an\\napproach, and within each there are numerous possiblevariations .\\nAnd many otherdifferent kindsofspatialstructure exist.\\nSpatialstructures and social structures\\nApartfrom leading to distinctkindsofinterregional relations, each\\nofthe different spatialstructures can also be associated with a\\ndifferent patternof socialdifferentiation between localities.This can\\nbeshownbylinkingup thedistinct geographical patterns of\\nrelations ofproduction which define each spatialstructure with\\nthe social characteristics ofthegroupsperforming thedifferent\\nfunctions .Itis notjusttherelations ofproduction which have a\\nspatialshape: so does the division oflabourbetween the social\\ngroupsperforming thedifferent functions within those relations. It\\nis possible, therefore , to link up the discussion ofsocial class in\\nChapter 2 withthatofspatialstructures earlierin thischapter.\\nFigure 3.5 summarises theargument so far.Ittakes anumberof\\noccupational groups, defines them in terms offunctions in the\\nrelations ofproduction , and thereby schematises their typical class\\nlocation. Iftheseconnections are now related to the specifically\\ngeographical organisation offunctions in each spatialstructure, the\\ndifferent social-geographical implications ofeachstructure are\\nimmediately apparent.\\nFirst, and most obviously , while a spatially-concentrated struc\\xad\\nture may leave each region with a locally-based capitalist class, this\\nclass will be lacking in those regions subject to external ownership\\nundertheothertwospatialstructures. Even in the region of\\nownership, moreover , thenatureofthecapitalist class may well\\nbedifferent fromthattypicalofspatially-concentrated production .\\nWhile in the lattercase it may consist ofindividual owners and\\ntraditional capitalists, in larger multi-regional corporations capital\\nis more likely to be personified in theshapeoftopcorporate\\nexecutives and top managers .

Certainly, regionsdominated byspatially\\xad\\nconcentrated production will include the full range ofadminis\\xad\\ntrativejobswithin their industries .Itmay well be, however, that\\nthosecompanies, precisely because they are small and confined to a\\nsingle region, are the ones with the more compressed managerial\\nhierarchies . This is indeed to be expected because the development\\nof such service functions ,through theextension of the division of\\nlabourincontrolandsupervision, ispartandparcelofthe\\nemergence oftheotherspatialstructures . Suchcontrasts may\\nsignificantly reduce (or reverse) the difference, withintheperipheral\\nregions, between plantsin thisspatialstructure and those in the\\nothertwo. This isa matterforempirical investigation . But the main\\npointisthatthecomparison at issue is between regions, and\\nbetween interregional variation indifferent spatialstructures .Itis\\nnot, as is sometimes supposed, between externally-owned plants\\nandlocally-owned ones within the same region. The argument is\\nnotprimarily - as it is sometimes seen to be - thatspatialstructures\\nwithinterregional hierarchies ofcontrolare\\'worse\\'in this way in\\nabsolute terms forperipheral regionsthanthelocationally-concen\\xad\\ntratedspatialstructure, butthattheyexacerbate thedifference on\\nthis score between peripheral andcentralregions. Indeed,in the\\nUnitedKingdom , manyofthe local areas which are now suffering\\nthe highest levels of externalcontrolare those in which white-collar\\nadministrative jobshave anyway for long formed a relatively small\\nproportion oftheemployment structure . The low numberofsuch\\njobsisnota newphenomenon. It is as a result ofacomparative,\\nnotanabsolute, worsening oftheirrepresentation inadministrative\\nandmanagerial jobsthatthe issue is now comingto the fore as an\\naspectof theregional policydebate.\\nOnceagain,moreover, conceptualising thingsintermsof\\ncapitalist relations ofproduction brings home the real issues. What\\nhasactually been lost to these regions is not a type ofjoband\\nassociated personnel (since such jobsand elements ofthe social\\nstructure hardlyexisted in these regions before) but a function\\nwithintheoverallsocialrelations ofproduction .Thespatial UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 109\\ninequality consists not so much in the uneven distribution ofjobs\\nofdifferent social types (and thus in some way of geographical\\n\\'equality ofopportunity\\') but in the removal from some regions,\\nand theconcentration inothers,of the more powerful, conceptual\\nandstrategic levels of controloverproduction. Moreover, it is\\nprecisely the development ofthe division of labourand the social\\nseparation of such functions to be performed by aseparate social\\ngroupwithin an extended hierarchy, which enables their geogra\\xad\\nphical removal. Once again the organisation ofproduction and the\\norganisation ofspace go handinhand.Particular formsof\\ngeographical inequality have as a necessary condition particular\\nformsoforganisation ofproduction. And inturn,the desire to take\\nadvantage ofspatialdistanceand difference can be what stimulates\\nthosedevelopments withinproduction.\\nThe three uses ofspace will also differ in their implications for\\ntherangeofjobsavailable toproduction - asopposed to\\nadministrative - workers. Obviously, the implications for thispart\\nof theemployment structure willdepend on the actualnatureofthe\\ntechnical division of labour,thenatureoftheassociated labour\\nprocesses, the kinds ofwagesand statusattached tojobs,and so on.\\nWhatcanbe said, however, is thatin the case oflocational\\nconcentration , the whole range ofworkers involved in production\\ninthatsector will be presentin one region. This range may be\\nnarrow, but such narrowness is not a function of thespatial\\nstructure itself. Much the same is likely to be true ofthe simple\\ncloningstructure - this use of space does not involve a part-process\\ndivision and the existence of a managerial hierarchy does not in\\nitself imply any differentiation inproduction jobs. Where there isa\\npart-process structure, however, themonofunctionality ofthe\\ndifferent plants may well lead to an accentuated separation of\\nparticular types of production workers into different regions. And\\nthese different types of production worker may belong to different\\npartsof the overall class structure. Once again, therefore, the\\npushing forward ofthedivision oflabour, this time within\\nproduction , when this also takes the form ofageographical\\nhierarchy, ismirrored ininterregional social difference. In the case\\nof the\\'electronics hierarchy\\' this social differentiation isparticu\\xad\\nlarly acute. Ifthedescription ofjobsin Figure 3.2 is put together\\nwith the definitions ofsocial class in Figure 3.5 it is clear thatthe\\nspatialhierarchy ofproduction coincides with a social hierarchy.\\nThis time the social hierarchy is, following Wright\\'s characterisa- 110Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ntion,thatbetween petty bourgeoisie andworking class,alonga\\ndimension related to the level ofindividual jobcontrol. This\\ncontrasts with the social class spectrum associated with the\\nhierarchy ofownership andcontrolwhich, being primarily a\\nfunction ofcontroloverproduction as a whole. and with super\\xad\\nvision, follows the gradations betweenworkingclass and bourgeois.\\nThis element of \\'themiddle class\\', the RandDworkers, thus has a\\ndifferent origin from thatofthemanagement hierarchy. Here the\\ncontrolis over their own labourprocess,ratherthan the labourof\\nothers.Once again, this aspect of spatialstructures ofproduction\\nhas been raised as a political issue. This time the problem is\\ninterpreted as being a lack of RandDjobsinperipheral regions.\\nBut once again the claim for a \\'fairshare\\'ofthehigh-status\\ntechnocrats, as for a fair share ofupper-management orcapitalists,\\nseems a curiousone for the labourmovement to make. In local\\nStatepolicy terms the issue is mirrored in theestablishment of\\nscienceparksfor the privatesector,inadvertising thearea\\'s\\nuniversities and its environmental attractions (usuallyofthe\\'rural\\nidyll\\' variety). Everywhere wants to be Silicon Valley.\\nBut it is clear thatnot everywhere canbecome Silicon Valley.\\nBoth the impossibility ofsuch plans and hopes and the fundamental\\nambiguity ofdemands for more high-status jobsare clarified by\\nseeing, behind the kind ofemployment itself, the social function it\\nperforms in the overall structure ofcapitalist relations ofproduc\\xad\\ntion - and the fact thatit is precisely the result ofthe division of\\nlabourinto such unequal specialisms. The very fact thatthereis\\nSilicon Valleymeans thatthere must be production-only outposts in\\nperipheral regions, both inter- and intranationally. Forwhat is\\ndistributed aboutthe world is not just\\'kindsofjobs\\',butfunctions\\nwithin the overall structure ofcapitalist production. It is the fact of\\naparticular formoftechnological development, andofa corre\\xad\\nsponding technical division oflabourwithinproduction which\\nenables this form of spatialinequality to develop. The absence of\\nRandDworkers from the ThirdWorldandfromnational\\nperipheries, andtheircongregation insuchareasasSilicon\\nValley, has as a necessary prerequisite thedevelopment ofa\\ndivision oflabourinproduction where some peoplehave a\\nmonopoly ofthatkindofstrategic brain-work, and where such\\nwork isattached to highstatusand high reward, while othersare\\nrelegated to the tedium ofassembly. Once again, it is not so much\\ntypes ofjobswhich people in peripheral regionsshouldreclaim, but Uneven Development and SpatialStructuresIII\\nfunctions, integral partsofthe overall structure andrelations of\\nproduction .\\nThese are very simplified examples. The position in any real case\\nwill be more complex. Therewill, forinstance, beaccountants and\\notherprofessionals within the managerial hierarchy. Suchemploy\\xad\\neesare really partofwhat might becalled the production processof\\nmanagement. They are outsidethe direct supervisory structure of\\nauthority and have a considerable degreeofautonomy inorganis\\xad\\ning their own work. They will be more likely to fall in the spectrum\\nbetweenproletarian andpetty-bourgeois. Conversely the division of\\nlabourwithinproduction generates its own specific supervisory\\nstructure .Alongside the assembly workersat thebottomendofthe\\nhierarchy will be technical \\'testers\\'ofvarioussortswhose social\\nposition - asformally derived from theirposition in thejob\\nstructure - might take them out ofthestraightforwardly proletar\\xad\\nian and on to (though onlyjuston to) the spectrum with the\\nbourgeoisie. The actualformofdifferentiation in anyinstance is an\\nempirical question.\\nThis, then, lays out a formal means for investigating the links\\nbetween spatialstructures ofproduction and the geography of\\nsocialstructure . In later chapters it will be developed inrelationto\\ngeographical patterns inGreatBritain. But, to pick up again the\\nargument ofChapter 2,relations ofproduction are not all that\\nmatters. Figure 3.4 includes two industries in which assembly work\\noften forms one stage ofproduction:electronics and cars, yet the\\nsocialimplications of assembly work in the two industries are very\\ndifferent. Inelectronics, thejobisusuallydonebywomen,\\nsometime sworking part-time and always receiving low wages. In\\nthe carindustry theequivalent workers(if they are not replaced by\\nrobots) are male and form partof the core oftradeunioneconomic\\nmilitancy. This difference is not obvious from the natureofthejob\\nitself. Such aspects ofsocialstructure are notderivable from simple\\nexamination ofthejobstructure involved in a particular organisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction .Neither,therefore , is thegeography ofsocial\\ndifferentiation simplyderivable fromspatialstructures ofproduc\\xad\\ntion.Itis at this point thatthe processes ofsocialallocation of\\ndifferent partsofthepopulation todifferent kindsofjobsbecomes\\nimportant. Existing social conditions outsidethefirm/sector , in\\notherwords, help determine the social organisation ofproduction\\nwithin it. And geography isimportant here too.\\n* * * 112SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nIt has been arguedin this section thatdifferent uses of space by\\nindustry (different spatialstructures) mayproduce distincteffects\\nonparticular regions, as well as alternative structures ofdifferentia\\xad\\ntionandpossibly inequality between regions. But equally, if not\\nmore,important isthatunderneath thishasgoneaparallel\\nargument whichemphasises stillfurtherthe need for theoretical\\nclarity.Forwhatmay look like a very similar regional phenomenon\\ncan have very different implications in terms of the interregional\\nstructure ofwhich it is part.Takean example: three different\\nregionsmay each have the same employment structure, all in\\nbranchplants,but indifferent industries and, crucially, in different\\nspatialstructures. In one it is the closing process in the footwear\\nindustry which is dominant, in the second electronics assembly, in\\nthethird,light engineering. In terms of employment in eachofthe\\nregions the effect is broadlythe same - a jobstructure dominated by\\nlow-paid anddistinctly uninspiring jobsforwomen, andonly\\nmiddle-level administrative jobs. But,apartfrom the common fact\\nofexternalownership, thestructures ofdifferentiation in which the\\nregions are embedded aredifferent in each case.\\nInfootwear, the region will be playinga role in a technical\\ndivisionoflabourwithin the industry. Theotherstages are not\\nresearch and skilled production, as inelectronics, but thecutting\\nprocess. As we have seen, this is performed by men and the two\\nstages may be separately locatedwhen the cost-surfaces ofthe two\\nkinds of labourare different. To the extentthatthis is ahierarchy\\nat all, it is one based on differences within manualworkersand on\\nsexualdiscrimination . Simply, in one region the men have jobs,in\\ntheotherthewomen,andin the first regionwagesare,in\\nconsequence, higherthanin the second. The income and status\\ndifferences in the electronics case, and consequently the degree of\\noverall regional inequality, are fargreater.They involve a span\\nbetween semi-skilled, skilled manualandhigh-status technical jobs.\\nIn the case oflightengineering, no technical division oflabourmay\\nbe involved at all, in which case the region will have the same\\nproduction employment structure asothersin which production\\nexists.\\nThereis more to a \\'distribution ofemployment\\' thanmeets the\\neye. Such a distribution is notjustapattern;it is the result ofan\\nunderlying structure .Whatis at issue is the way in which different\\nlocalities can beincorporated into the developing relations of\\ncapitalist production. In this example, similaremployment effects UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 113\\nin aparticular regionactually result from very different structures\\nandconsequently havedifferent implications for\\'interregional\\nrelations\\'. Andwhat this means in turnisthatthey have also very\\ndifferent implications foractionif thoserelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination are to be combated.\\n3.4The uniqueness of place\\nNo two places are alike. People who only stopover atairports(to\\nand from conferences ,perhaps) might get the impression ofa\\npervading similarity, but any deeperexploration will soon dispel\\nthatillusion.Geographical variation isprofound andpersistent, and\\nthis is true even within a country asapparently homogeneously\\ndeveloped as theUnitedKingdom . Wetalkof\\'theperipheral\\nregions\\', but they are all very different. The term \\'innercities\\'\\nincludes Merseyside, Glasgow andLondon, asdifferent as can be\\ninculture,political historyand thecharacter ofthelabourmove\\xad\\nment. Any trainjourney acrosscountry provides ample evidence:\\ndifferent kindsofpeople get on andoffatLancaster ,Grange-over\\xad\\nSands and Barrow-in-Furness.\\nAs we have alreadyargued, these differences matter.Mostpeople\\nstill live their lives locally, their consciousness is formed in a distinct\\ngeographical place.Atanyone timedifferent areasmay be\\nchanging incontrasting ways;different battlesare being fought\\nout,different problems faced.\\nSo how can this variety be analysed? Spatially-differentiated\\npatternsofproduction are one ofthe bases ofgeographical\\nvariation in social structure and class relations. They are not the\\nonlycause,butthey are significant. Theanalysis ofregional\\ncontrasts andconflicts in Belgium in Chapter 2showedclearly\\nhow the organisation ofproduction can be an important condition\\nfor the development of social andpolitical culture. Gramsci\\'s\\nanalyses ofTurinbringout many ofthe same points:\\'Turin. . .\\nis theindustrial city, theproletarian city,parexcellence .. .like one\\ngreatfactory...powerfully united by industrial production. The\\nTurinproletariat was able to advance so faralongtheroadof\\nSoviet-type massorganisation precisely because ofthispowerfully\\nunitedcharacter ofthe city\\'s industry\\' (1920, p. 151).\\nIt is not, of course, as simple as that.Forone thing, local areas\\nrarely bear the marksofonly one form ofeconomic structure . They 114SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nareproducts oflong and varied histories.Different economic\\nactivities and forms ofsocialorganisation have come and gone,\\nestablished theirdominance, lingered on, and later died away.\\nViewed more analytically , andconcentrating for themoment on the\\neconomic, thestructure oflocaleconomies can be seen as a product\\nofthecombination of\\'layers\\',ofthe successive imposition over the\\nyearsofnewroundsofinvestment, new forms ofactivity.\\nThese new forms oflocal activity are each related to a wider\\nsetting.Spatialstructures ofdifferent kindscan be viewed\\nhistorically (and very schematically) as emerging in a succession\\nin which each is superimposed upon, and combined with, the effects\\nofthespatialstructures which came before. In each ofthesespatial\\nstructures economic activity in an individual local area plays a\\nspecific role and exists in certainrelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination witheconomic activity in otherareas. Each spatial\\nstructure is a system ofinterdependence into which the industrial\\nactivityofany local area is inserted. So if a local economy can be\\nanalysed as the historical productofthecombination oflayersof\\nactivity, those layers also represent in turn the succession ofroles\\nthe local economy has played within wider national andinterna\\xad\\ntionalspatialstructures .\\nEach new layer, each new roundofinvestment, brings with it\\npotentially neweconomic basesofsocialorganisation, new\\n\\'structural capacities\\' anda newoverallposition withinthe\\nbroadergeographical divisionoflabour. In the preceding section\\nwe drew outsomeoftheinternally necessary implications ofa\\nrangeofdifferent spatialstructures. But the effects ofspatial\\nstructures in aparticular situation cannotbepredicted from such\\na logic alone. The actualimplications willdepend,notjuston the\\nnatureofthe new roundofinvestment, but also on the existing\\ncharacter ofthe areas affected. The combination oflayers is a form\\nofmutualdetermination, ofthe existing characteristics ofthe area\\nor regional system with those ofthegeographical patternand\\neffectsofprevious uses.Thus,for example, while a spatially\\xad\\nconcentrated structure implies a local capitalist class and other\\nspatialstructures donot,if those uses ofan area succeed each\\nother,onequestion will be how the class related to the earlier\\nspatialstructure reorientates itspositionwithin the region. Clearly,\\nthe kinds ofchanges which do occur will dependbothon the\\ncharacteristics oftheincoming industry, the way its activity in the\\narea isincorporated into its overall spatialstructure, and on the Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 115\\nexistingstructure of industry in the area (e.g. Lojkine, 1977).Lipietz\\n(1977, pp. 85, 89 et seq.)pointsto the kinds of battles between\\ndifferent parts of capital, and the consequent changes in the local\\nbalance between them which can ensue from the entry ofnational\\nandinternational firms into an area hithertodominated by smaller\\nand more regionally-based companies. Theincorporation ofa local\\narea into a new division of labouris likely to cause change and\\ndisruption , economically and socially. This, too, is a social and\\nhistorical process. So Foster\\'s (1974) analysis ofthefootwear\\nindustry in Northampton does indicate how the natureof the\\nlabourmarketthere, and the particular use made ofit, was one\\ncondition for the weakness ofthelabourmovement. But \\'if this was\\nthe problem, it only proved insurmountable because it was not\\npossible to use the same tactics as in Oldham\\' (p. 103).And this in\\nturnwas due to an inheritance ofhistory:\\'Unlike Oldham,\\nNorthampton hadexperienced littlewartime radicalism and\\ncertainly no breakdown in law and order. A food riot in spring\\n1795had quickly been smashed up by the Horse Guardsand by the\\nsecondquarterof thecenturythere was an efficient police force and\\napermanent garrison.Consequently withoutanytradition of anti\\xad\\nstatelaboursolidarity and with strong-arm tactics ruled out, there\\nwas almost no way ofimposing union discipline on the constant\\nstreamofimmigrant workers\\'.Itwas not justlabour-market\\nconditions but the lack of a history of organisation which made\\nunionisation so difficult. And this in turn was the result of conflict.\\n\\'In terms ofindustrial coercion the bootwas very much on the\\notherfoot. Savage punishments - flogging, imprisonment - were\\ninflicted for work offences, jailings were successfully used to break\\nthe trades movement of1834\\'(p. 103).And the effects of this were\\ntocolourlocal politics for a long time ahead. \\'So, instead of a\\nlabourmovement, all thatexisted were small islands of organised\\nworkers ...Northampton politics reflect this situation closely ...\\nIndeed it is this . . . that holds the key to Northampton politics\\nright up till the ascendancy ofBradlaugh\\' (pp. 103-4).\\nTheoutcomeofthedisruption, and the form and direction of the\\nchange,thatresults from the insertion ofa local area into a new\\ndivision of labour,willdepend on the existing character ofthe area,\\nitself the result of an alreadylong and complex history. Local\\nchanges and characteristics are notjustsome simple \\'reflection\\' of\\nbroader processes; local areas are not justin passive receipt of\\nchanges handed down from some higher national orinternational 116SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nlevel. The vast variety ofconditions alreadyexisting at local level\\nalso affects how those processes themselves operate.\\nIt isalso more than this. We are talkingprimarily oftheeconomy\\nand\\'theeconomic\\', yet the sequence ofwidercontexts within which\\nlocalities are set is also ideological and political; social in a much\\nbroadersense. The social changes in an area, the shifts in prevailing\\nideology and temperament , are not boundup only with economic\\nchanges within thatlocality. They reflect also broadershifts and in\\notheraspectsofsociety. The layers ofhistory which are sedimented\\nover time are not justeconomic; there are also cultural, political\\nand ideological strata,layers which also have their local specifi\\xad\\ncities. And this aspect oftheconstruction of\\'locality\\' further\\nreinforces theimpossibility ofreading offfrom a \\'layerof\\ninvestment\\' anyautomatic reverberations on thecharacter ofa\\nparticular area.\\nConceptualising things in this way makes it possible to combine\\nanunderstanding ofgeneral trends with a recognition, alongside\\nand within that,of very great diversity. The uniqueness ofplace and\\ntheconstantly evolving and shifting systems of interdependence are\\ntwo sides of the same coin.\\n* * *When,in the middle decades of the twentieth century, geographers\\nswitched their main concernfromunderstanding the complexity and\\nuniqueness ofregionstowardsthe vigorous pursuitofempirically\\xad\\ngeneralisable laws, the debatewas often posed in terms ofthe\\nspecific and consequently descriptive versus the generalisable and\\nsupposedly scientific. Therewas, it was argued,little one could do\\nwith the uniquesavecontemplate it; the aim shouldbe to identify\\nempirically-observable relations which had a sufficient degree of\\nregularity to be graced with the statusof\\'law\\'.Theargument here is\\nthattheopposition presupposed inthatdebateis itself a false one.\\n\\'General laws\\' are aboutcausation , not empirical correlation. They\\nare as well if notbetterestablished incausalstudiesofthe\\nparticular, themuch-maligned \\'casestudy\\'. And by the same\\ntoken, the unique, the productofmanydeterminations , iscertainly\\namenable to analysis. It is indeed time thatregional and local\\nparticularities werereinstated as acentralfocusofgeographical\\nthinking. This is not to argue for a returnto\\'goodold-fashioned\\nregional studies\\' but to suggest thatthe same subject mattercan\\nnow beapproached within a rigorous analytical framework, with\\nsomeunderstanding oftherelationbetween the general and the UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 117\\nparticular, andwith anappreciation ofhow each local areafitsinto\\nthe wider scheme ofcapitalist production andsocialrelations. There\\nis a basis for a new regional geography .\\nTheimplications ofthisimpinge onotherdebates, for if the\\nactualempirical implications ofany given spatialstructure cannot\\nbe logically deduced, but must be analysed as theresultofits\\ncombination with the existingcharacter ofanarea, it follows that\\nthe effects ofany given productive activitymay vary from region to\\nregion.Merseyside andtheMezzogiorno, SaoPauloandBridgend\\nhave all been drawninto theworld-wide production ofcars,but the\\nimplications for each have been very different. Theeffectsofthe\\ninstallation ofmajorcoastalsteelandpetrochemical complexes\\nhavenotbeenreplicated in each case. Theinvestments atDunkirk\\n(Castells andGodard, 1974), Fos-sur-Mer (Bleitrach andChenu,\\n1975) and Taranto (Courlet, 1977) were notexactlythe same in\\ntheirimpact.Theyvariedaccording to theparticular characteristics,\\nthehistoryandpresentconditions ,ofeach local area.Andthe fact\\nthatthese effects ofparticular spatialstructures will vary according\\nto theconditions in which they operatemeansthatit is fruitless to\\nexamine the real world for an empirically-generalised outcome in\\nordertosubstantiate someinherent logic.Theinternalnecessity of\\naspatialstructure does not get \\'actedout\\'in the real world in pure\\nform.Whattakes place is the interrelation ofthe new spatial\\nstructure with theaccumulated resultsofthe old.The\\'combination\\'\\noflayers, in otherwords, really does mean combination, with each\\nsideofthe process affecting theother. So this way oflookingat the\\nworld is in no sense deterministic .\\'Structural analysis\\' as it has\\nsometimes beencalled,doesnotnecessarily mean\\'top-down \\'\\nanalysis; far from obliterating thepossibility ofvariety,itprovides\\nanapproach to itsexplanation.\\nMoreover ,notonlymayagivenproduction facility have\\ndifferent effectsindifferent regions, butareaswithdifferent\\nhistories may also provide advantageous locations for the same\\nkindofproduction.

But those\\nlabourreserves came out ofverydifferent socialhistories. Location\\ntheoryhastendedto seelabouravailability as a\\'location factor\\'. It\\nis,ofcourse; but such \\'location factors\\'are also the productof\\nsocialrelations, ofaregion\\'s previous succession ofroles in the\\nwidernational andinternational spatialstructures. Thisbringsus 118SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nfull circle: it is precisely because areas have different histories that\\nthe arrival of a new form ofeconomic activity has in each case\\ndistinct social and economic results.\\nSo far in this section it has been implied thatthe economic\\nstructure of a region is the productofa seriesof simple and discrete\\nroundsof investment, in each of which one new spatial structure\\nwill bearticulated with a given spatial surface. But the historical\\nprocess is more complex than this. At any given time, more than\\none new spatial structure may bein the process ofestablishment, be\\nundergoing changes, or be disappearing with decline. Itis the effect\\nofthecombination of all these changes with the existing geogra\\xad\\nphicalpattern(itself the result of previous uses ofspace) which\\ncontributes to the distinctive economic characteristics of local areas.\\nThe veryfact thata region may, throughthe variety of itseconomic\\nactivities, be embedded in a multitude of spatial structures, each\\nentailing different organisations ofdominance andsubordination,\\nserves to emphasise thatit is not regions which interrelate, but the\\nsocial relations of production which take place over space. The\\nresultsofall this in terms ofthe geographical distribution ofsocial\\nclasses and groups is a geographical. or spatial. divisionoflabourin\\nthecountryas a whole. And it is this which forms the basis - the\\nnew locational surface - for subsequent patternsof investment.\\nTheincorporation ofan area into anew,dominant, spatial\\nstructure may have one ofanumberof different effects on the\\nsocial and economic statusof that region. Itmay well be thatits\\nnew role simply reinforces the social and economic advantage or\\ndisadvantage of the area. Itmay, however, be thatthe fortunes of a\\nregion are reversed, that in terms of a given range of indicators its\\n\\'performance\\' becomes closer to thatofthenational average. Yet\\nagain, it may be thatthe relative advantage ordisadvantage of the\\nregion is maintained in some general sense but thatit ischanged in\\nitsnaturein termsofthe indices on which it can be measured. In\\notherwords, both the economic structure which underlies inter\\xad\\nregional inequality, and the way in which thatinequality is\\nexpressed socially, are transformed .Geographical differentiation\\nhas been reproduced, but in a changed form. Each ofthese\\nsituations isentirely different, but any approach toregional\\nanalysis must be able to handle\\'them all. The cumulative causation\\nmodel of Myrdal (1957),and adoptedby Holland (1976),can only\\nhandle the first case. The equilibrating mechanisms ofneoclassical\\neconomics are happy only with the second. Neitherofthem can Uneven Development and Spatial Structures 119\\ndeal with the third. But they all happen.Unfortunately, someofthe\\nalternative approaches to analysis developed recently (see Chap\\xad\\nter 2) also tend to be restricted to expecting only one outcome - in\\nthis case usually increasing inequality . Anyadequate framework\\nmust be able to deal with any ofthese cases. Itis notenoughto\\nresort to a separate, andtherefore deterministic ,\\'model\\'for each\\ndifferent empirical outcome.\\nUp to now we have been dealing with the effectsofthe\\ncombination ofnew forms ofeconomic activity with the existing\\ncharacteristics ofaparticular area. It was implicit thatthis\\'area\\'\\nhadalreadybeen defined. In fact, however, shifts in the dominant\\nspatial division oflabourmayproduce acomplete change in the\\nverygeographical patternofspatialdifferentiation .Thishas\\nimportant implications forwhatismeantby \\'aregion\\'or \\'a\\nlocality\\'.Itis very possible for the patternofgeographical\\ninequality to change. Regions themselves are products ofthese\\nprocesses, so the geographical framework for studies ofspatial\\nstructures must allow for the possibility ofits owntransformation.\\n* * *Thishistorical process can also be schematised atnational level.\\nHere, successive layers ofspatialstructures ofproduction lay the\\nbasis for a sequence ofspatialdivisions oflabour.At anypointin\\ntime the geographical patternofeconomic activity which is\\nassociated with the new spatialstructures isoverlaid on and\\ncombined with the patternproduced in previous periods. And each\\nnewcombination ofsuccessive layers produces , or may produce, a\\nnew form and a new distribution ofinequality, which in turn is the\\ngeographical basis for the next roundofinvestment. \\'The regional\\nproblem\\', orspatialinequality moregenerally, is thus a very\\ncomplex thing. Itwillchangeover time in bothform and pattern.\\nItmay alter in terms ofthenatureoftheunderlying interregional\\nrelations, in termsofthe social differences and inequalities on which\\nit ismeasured , and in the terms ofitsgeographical shape. And this\\nshifting intranational inequality isitselflockedintoawider\\ninternational setofspatialstructures and division oflabour.\\nThe fact thatthere is such geographical differentiation within a\\ncountry,thatthere is regional inequality or an\\'innercityproblem\\',\\nhas animpacton theoperation ofwhat are often thoughtofas\\n\\'national\\' processes .Itmay help orhindernational ratesof\\naccumulation .Itis not possible to make any a prioriassumptions\\naboutwhetherthe effects ofthepatternofspatialdifference will be 120SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nproblematical orpositively useful for capital, butthere will be\\neffects.Indeed,it isentirelypossible thattheimplications will be\\ndifferent fordifferent partsofcapital.This was clearly the case in\\nItalyover the pastfew decades (see Chapter 2).Spatialinequality\\nandgeographical differentiation may also be influential in the\\nformation ofnational political alliances and the formulation of\\napparently national, as well as clearly spatial, policies. Therewill be\\neffects, too, on national classrelations andclassstructure. Seen in\\none way, the sum totalof all the changes going on in the different\\npartsofacountrymayaddup to an \\'aggregate\\' national effect. But\\nit may also be thatgeographical separation andgeographical\\ndifferentiation areimportant to theproduction ofthatnational\\neffect. Once again,\\'geography\\' isnotjustaproduct ofsocial\\nrelations; itis anintegralpartoftheirdevelopment. Lipietz (1977)\\nwrites: \\'La structuration de I\\'espace est la dimension spatialedes\\nrapports sociaux, et, ceux-ci etantluttesde classes, lastructuration\\nde l\\'espace est luttes de classes, nonseulement en ce sens qu\\'elleen\\nest Ieproduit, mais en ce qu\\'elleen est un enjeu et meme un moyen\\'\\n(p.90).\\nOneofthearguments ofthe restofthisbookisthatchangesof\\nthissort,wheregeography is animportant component of classand\\npolitical relations, are going on now in the UnitedKingdom . 4\\nSomeChanging SpatialStructures in\\ntheUnitedKingdom\\n4.1Settingthe scene\\nThe inheritance: social and spatial\\nMuchofwhat is peculiarly characteristic of \\'British capitalism\\', of\\nBritisheconomy and society, stems from the long inheritance ofits\\ninternational positionand role. Frommerchant capitalism, through\\nthe heyday of Empireand the dominance ofinternational trade\\nthrough its role as workshop of the world, to the long twentieth\\xad\\ncenturyprocessofdecline, this international orientation ,though\\nchanging in its form and in its implications, has been fundamental\\n(Gamble, 1981). And this inheritance hasnotbeen one which\\nregistered only in economic terms. The economic role within the\\nnineteenth-century international divisionoflabourleft itsmarkin\\nthe form of a particular setofclassrelations andparticular contours\\nofclassstructure. Itisthrough theseclassrelations andtheir\\nconsequences fornational politics that\\'theBritisheconomy\\' ,\\naccumulation within the geographical boundaries of thenation\\nstate,continues to beaffected,constrained, andoftenunder\\xad\\nmined, by its inheritance from the past.\\nThestructure ofthecapitalist class still shows these marksvery\\nclearly.Probably the most celebrated effect is the unusualdegreeof\\nseparation which has historically existed in Britainbetween banking\\ncapitalandindustrial capital(see Brett et al.,1975;Gough,1975;\\nGroves et al.,1975;National Economic Development Office\\n(NEDO), 1976; Hu, 1975). The fact thatfor years British banking\\ncapitalhadthewholeworldtochoosefromwhenselecting\\nprofitable investments enabledthegrowthofapowerful financial\\ncentreandencouraged in it an international andspeculative\\ncharacter ratherthananypropensity to invest in home-based\\nBritishindustry. ThegrowthofEmpire and ofa wider world\\nrole, which went handinhandwith the development ofthepower\\nbaseof\\'theCity\\',afforded too many otheropportunities . The\\n121 122SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncorollary, of course, is thatthe health ofthe financial sector has a\\nhigh degree of independence from the health of the home-based\\neconomy. The money which British bankingcapital lends to British\\nindustry tends to be in the form of short-term (and more recently\\nmedium-term) loans ratherthan of long-term commitments . The\\neffect is not so much a shortage of cash for investment in industry\\n(the claim sometimes made) but a certain separation of interests\\nbetween\\'theCity\\' and \\'industry\\' and a relative lack ofinstitutional\\nconnection between the two.\\nButthatdivision within British capital is not the only one, nor\\neven always the most important. Thecharacter ofindustrial, and\\nparticularly manufacturing , capital has also been moulded by the\\nlegacyofEmpire and the international domination ofa century and\\na half ago. Again for reasons of opportunity historicaIly available\\nto British capital more thananyother,Britishmanufacturing\\nindustry has had a particularly high tendency to direct investment\\noverseas. One effect ofthis has been the development within British\\nindustry of a veritable chasm between on the one side highly\\ninternationalised sections with a major, often themajor,orientation\\noverseas and on the othersections where production is confined to\\nthenational or even regional levels.Theimportance ofthe\\ninternationalised sections in turn lies behind the relatively low\\nlevelsofinvestment \\'athome\\', the increasingly outdated capital\\nstock and the tendency to falI behind competitors in levels of\\nproductivity . Muchofthe investment which goes overseas is in the\\nnewesttechnologies and the newest products. British industry\\nprovides at the international levela telling example ofthepoint\\nmade in Chapter 3thathaving your capital owned locally, \\'your\\nowncapitalist class\\', is no guarantee at all of local reinvestment.\\nThese lines ofdivide, between financial and industrial capital and\\nbetweeninternational and national elements within industry, cross\\xad\\ncut each other, each having its effect on political formation and on\\npolicy. Their combination has meant thatfinancial and interna\\xad\\ntional perspectives and interests have been more powerful politicaIlythan has nationally-based industrial capital. This has been reflected\\nin theorganisation of the State. The natureanddominance\\nofthe\\nTreasury is frequently acknowledged, but the impact goes deeper\\nthanthat- asGamble(1981)points out \\'therehas never . ..been a\\npermanent government department to speak for and represent the\\ninterests of the national economy and national industry\\' (p. 180).\\nNot surprisingly, this internalstructure ofBritish capital has also Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 123\\nfound its reflection in policy, and in particular in the concern for\\nthestrengthof sterling. The two strongest and most dynamic parts\\nof British-owned capital - the banking sector and big, internatio\\xad\\nnalised industry - have interests which coincide neither with the\\nrequirements of astronginternal economy nor on all occasions with\\neachother\\'s. British capital and the British economy are by no\\nmeans the same thing. And both the political strength of the City\\nand ofinternationalised industry and the conflicts between those\\ninterests and those of the British nationaleconomy continue to this\\nday.\\nThe early and wide extension of capitalist relations ofproduc\\xad\\ntion, and the legacy of Empire and international dominance, had\\neffects also on the working class. The British labourmovement is\\nstrongin economic and industrial terms. It is a strength which in\\npartderives from both its sheer numerical importance and the\\nability of British capital in the nineteenth centuryto appease its\\n\\'own\\'working class with a share of the imperial spoils. But it is an\\neconomic strengthratherthan a political one. The relation between\\nparty and trade unions is the reverse ofthatin, for instance, Italy\\nand France. In the United Kingdom the unions gave birth to the\\nLabourParty, and thus was established a separation between the\\npolitical and the economic wings of the labourmovement. The\\ntrade union movement\\'s considerable strength, itscomparative\\nindependence from the State and the importance of itsshop-floor\\nlevel oforganisation have, with notableexceptions, tended to be\\nassociated with a sphere ofactivity more or less confined to\\neconomic defence and a resistance to changes in production which\\nhas occasionally been characterised asLuddite.Infact, over the\\nperiod dealt with here, the union movement has countenanced huge\\nlosses of jobsin the name oftechnological progress. But in many\\nsectors of the economy capital\\'s attempts atmodernisation did not\\ncome until too late, until decline had alreadyset in.Undersuch\\ncircumstances, programmes ofinvestment, modernisation and\\ntechnical change inevitably produced consequences more at odds\\nwith the immediate interests of labourthanthey would have if\\npursued in a period of expansion.\\nThe conflicts, then, were complex. Within capitalthere was a\\nstraightforward conflict between the dominant elements with their\\npoliticalcommitment to themaintenance ofthetraditional world\\nrole,andtherequirement tomodernise thesocietyandthe\\neconomy. The dominant political interests have been reflected in 124SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe liberal bias ofa State which has been consistently unwilling\\neitherto tackle the archaicinstitutions ofBritish society, which\\nserved to preserve Empire and class rule ratherthan the interestsof\\naccumulation in the home economy (\\'interests\\' for which there was\\nno powerful political voice), or to intervene directly in industry to\\npromote rationalisation orgreaterproductivity. This went together\\nwith the indisputable factthatsuch a process would in any case be\\nproblematic, given the economic and defensive strength ofthe\\norganised working class.\\n* * *Geography was integral to all ofthis. The internalgeography ofthe\\ncountryreflected its international position. Thedominance ofCity,\\nEmpire and tradecontributed to theimportance ofState, financial\\nandcommercial activities, and of the employment associated with\\nthem, in London. Thedominant formofregional problem in the\\nUnitedKingdom throughout theearlierpartofthetwentieth\\ncenturywas also in partaninheritance ofEmpire.Itresulted from\\nthe decline ofmajorsectorsofthe economy with particular formsof\\nspatialstructure.Itwas those spatialstructures whichmoulded the\\nnational geography ofemployment from the nineteenth centuryup\\nto the 1930s, and which were characteristic ofa smallgroupof\\nindustries -coal-mining andexporting , iron and steel manufacture ,\\nshipbuilding - which owed their dominance in thegeography of\\nemployment to the role ofthe United Kingdom overthatperiod in\\ntheinternational division of labour.Itwas the United Kingdom \\'s\\nposition as animperial power, its early lead in the growthof\\nmodern industry, and its consequent commitment to freetrade\\nand to its own specialisation inmanufacturing withinthisinterna\\xad\\ntional division oflabour, whichenabledthe rapid growth, up to the\\nFirst World War,ofthesemajorexporting industries . Thespatial\\nstructures which were established by those industries were those\\nwhere all stages ofproduction of thecommodity areconcentrated\\nwithin single geographical areas. The comparatively low level of\\nseparation offunctions within the process of production , and the\\nrelatively small variation inlocational requirements between such\\npotentially separable functions , were not sufficient to make geo\\xad\\ngraphical differentiation a major attraction . Inestablishing this\\nspatialpatternofproduction within the United Kingdom these\\nindustries soughtaccess to portsforimportofrawmaterialand for\\nexporting goods, a plentiful supply oflabour, and, to some extent\\nstill, access to coal. Since these were characteristics not evenly Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 125\\ndistributed overthecountry, thegeographical pattern which\\nevolved was simply thateachofthesemajorindustries concen\\xad\\ntrateditsproduction on one, or a small numberof, regions. Ships in\\nClydeside andthenorth-eastofEngland, coal insouthWales,and\\nso on.Conversely, given the simple quantitative importance ofthese\\nindustries, anumberofmajorregionsofthecountrybecameheavily\\nspecialised in one or two oftheseindustries .\\nThisgeographical structure was based on the dominant roleof\\nBritainin the world economy andon thecharacteristics of the\\nconsequently dominant industries. Itwas theformerwhichensured\\ntheimportance ofthelatter.Inthe early twentieth century, halfof\\nBritish iron andsteelproduction and athirdofcoaloutputwas\\nexported directly(DeaneandCole, 1967), while bothwerefurther\\nused inotherindustries which in turn were also based on Britain\\'s\\ninternational role. Ontheotherhandit wasthestageof\\ndevelopment oftheindustries themselves whichinfluenced the\\nkindofspatialstructure which was adopted.\\nThespatialdivision of labourwithin the countryas a whole was\\nthus based primarily ondifferent sectoral specialisations .Itwas\\nonly when the UnitedKingdom \\'srelation to theinternational\\neconomy changed, with its decline as a world tradingpower,that\\nproduction in theseindustries felldrastically andthesepreviously\\xad\\ndominant spatialstructures produced aregional problem. Muchof\\nthis old basis of Empire andinternational dominance has over the\\nyears been nationalised andthecapitalwhich once owned them,\\noftenitselfregionally based, has moved offintoothersectorsand\\nothergeographical areas.The new industries ofthetwentieth\\ncenturygrew up in the south-east andmidlands ofEngland. At\\nfirst, too, there was some acquiescence on thepartof theupper\\nechelons ofthetradeunionmovement (itself for the same reasons\\nundergoing achangein itsinternal balance of power) to this\\nsectoralandgeographical refocusing oftheeconomy. \\'The demise\\nofthebasicindustries wasaccepted as a\"second industrial\\nrevolution\" particularly byCitrine(TheGeneral Secretary) and\\nBevin(TGWU General Secretary)\\' (Cooke, 1981b, p. 25). Such\\nunion leaders, as representatives ofthe new industries andin the\\ncontextoftheir new co-operation with the State,therebyeased the\\nway for the establishment of thenewly-emerging spatialdivisionof\\nlabour.\\'Theinterests of theright-wing generalunions(TGWU and\\nNUGMW) in the new semi-skilled industries , andtheirsubsequent\\ninvolvement ingovernment , most obviously in the shapeof Bevin, 126SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nreflected the regional as well as the sectoral shiftthathadtaken\\nplace in the power-relations ofindustrial Britain\\'(Cooke,pp.26-7).\\nBut the decline ofthe old basic sectorsproduced appalling poverty\\nandapersistent \\'regional problem\\'.For,becauseofthespatial\\nstructure oftheseindustries, andtheirdominance ofparticular\\nregions, the effect ofthischangeineconomic andpolitical relations\\nwas simply thatsectoral declinebrought with itregional decline.\\nTheindices on which this kind of regional inequality wasregistered\\n(inotherwords,the kindofregional problem which was produced)\\nwere the ones which becamethe classic measures of\\'theregional\\nproblem\\' inBritain. Themostimportant ofthesemeasures was\\nunemployment, with the level ofoutmigration , percapitaearnings,\\nandthe level ofmanufacturing employment playing subsidiary\\nroles.\\nTherewere,ofcourse,othergroupsofindustries which were\\nimportant, bothin thenational economy andin thegeographical\\nstructure, whichderivedmuchof theirpre-eminence fromBritain\\'s\\ninternational position andwhichhavesubsequently declined.\\nTextiles, primarily cottontextiles, are the mostobvious example.\\nBut there are interesting differences between textiles on the one\\nhandandcoal, iron andsteelandshipbuilding on theother.First,\\nthey are from different partsoftheeconomy andhavedeveloped\\nvery differentformsofcapitalorganisation .Thesetwofactorsare\\nlinked.Thevitaleconomic andpoliticalplaceofcoal,steelandeven\\nshipbuilding was animportant consideration in their subsequent\\nnationalisation .Thechangeincapitalorganisation as a result of\\ndeclinewas very different intextilesandalthough therewas\\nconsiderable government intervention toorganise theprocessof\\ndecline the industries haveremained entirelywithinprivateowner\\xad\\nship. A furthercontrast arosefrom the sectors\\'different labour\\nprocesses andlabourrequirements.

Spatially, the Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 127\\ndecline has been accompanied byinterregional consolidation into\\nlarger units ofproduction , but the main changeinspatialstructure\\nhasconcerned ownership , withnationalisation andcentralised\\ncontrolreplacing privateand,often, regional ownership .\\nTheFifties: a wasted decade\\nThesecharacteristics of the United Kingdom\\'s economy, society\\nandgeography werereinforced duringthe fifties. The long post-war\\nboomoftheinternational capitalist economy allowed British\\nindustry tocoastalongwithoutthoughtof serious reorganisation.\\nAt thebeginning oftheperiod,Britishmanufactures stillaccounted\\nfor 25 per cent ofworldexports. But this decade was to see the\\nbeginning of the end ofthatposition. Thetraditional orientation of\\nthe\\'State and of important sectionsofcapitalcontinued . Politically\\nthere was more concern with Suez and with organising areasonably\\ndignified withdrawal from Empire, than with the domestic econo\\xad\\nmy. And British capitalinvested massively abroad.\\'Theopportu\\xad\\nnitiesthatBritain\\'s imperial tradingandfinancial connections\\nprovided led to the development after1950ofsome vast and very\\nsuccessful international businesses\\' (Gamble, 1981, p. 113). The\\nworld vision ofsectionsofmanufacturing capitalwas thus rein\\xad\\nforced, and the conflict between the interests ofinternationalised\\nindustry and finance, and the requirements ofthedomestic econo\\xad\\nmy wasexacerbated. Little was donetoupdateproduction within\\nthe United Kingdom itself.Moreover , extensive expansion drew\\nheavily on domestic suppliesoflabour.Immigration provided extra\\nworkers, butthatsourcetoo began to be cutback with the\\nincreasing restrictions from the early sixties on. The fifties were a\\ndecade when the complacent claimthatwe had never had it so good\\ntemporarily concealed the fact ofyawning structural weaknesses.\\nMuch the same complacent inactivity appliedalso toquestions of\\ngeography . In the fifties regional inequality did not figure promi\\xad\\nnently on the political agenda.Throughout thatdecade the main\\nconcern expressed aboutgeographical differences wasthatthe\\ndifferential tightness ofregional labourmarkets mightcause\\n\\'overheating\\' in theeconomy as a whole. Itwasreasoned thatthe\\nstrengthoflabourin the relatively full-employment regionsofthe\\nsouth-east andmidlands ofEngland, combined withnational\\nbargaining structures, would push up wages to a level above what 128SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncouldhave been won hadunemployment beenmoreevenly\\ndistributed aboutthecountry. Theargument seems never to have\\ncarriedsufficient political weight to get an active regionalpolicyoff\\ntheground. This omission was akin to British capital\\'s tardiness in\\nupdating itsproduction techniques , and it too was to have serious\\nconsequences . Itshouldbe noted, to begin with, thatthe lack of\\nregional policy was in no way a reflection ofwhatwashappening to\\nregionalinequality. Differences in unemployment levelswere in fact\\nquitehighduringthe fifties. Absolute levelsofunemployment,\\nhowever, except for those in Northern Ireland, were low, with the\\nold basic industries enjoying for much ofthe decade a relative\\nboom. The low absolute levels seem to have had more political\\neffectthanthe relatively high levels ofdisparity, and\\'theregional\\nquestion\\' was not a majorpolitical issue. This relative quiescence,\\ncombined with aConservative government committed todecontrol,\\nresulted in almosta decade of virtualinaction, a passivity broken\\nonly by the occasional ad hoc.andsometimes ill-judged, interven\\xad\\ntion in direct response to social pressure (seeBoardofTrade,\\n1955-6). The decision to split investment in a steel stripmillproject\\nbetween Llanwern insouthWalesandRavenscraig inScotland was\\nsuch a political response. In this way, the rest ofthe long boom, the\\nperiodwhichprovided themostpropitious conditions for a\\nsuccessful regional policy, was wasted. IndeedasHudson (1982)\\namplydemonstrates, there were clear decisions nottoattractjobs\\nfor men to the north-east, for fearoflosinglabourfrom the mines.\\nThesubsequent periodofactive regional policy has been conducted\\nunderconditions ofmanufacturing employment decline.Forthe\\nendofthe longboombroughtwith it also the returnoftheregional\\nproblem.\\nThe cracks begin to show\\nBy the early sixties the long-term weakness ofthe British economy\\nwasclear.Theset-back ofthelatefiftieshadgiven the first\\nintimations, the recession of1957revealed the vulnerability of\\nbasic sectors, and by the early sixties it was irrefutable - every\\nindicator ofgrowthandcompetitiveness was on the slide. The\\ninternational capitalist economy washeaving itselfintoa new\\nposition, a new international division oflabourwasasserting\\nitself, and the British economy wasbothchanging its role and\\nlosing out. Some ChangingSpatial Structures in the UK 129\\nInemployment terms, 1966was the turningpoint.It was in that\\nyearthatmanufacturing employment began to decline, notjust\\nrelatively, as a proportion oftotalemployment in theeconomy, but\\nin termsofthetotalnumberofjobsitprovided. And since 1966the\\ndecline has continued, with only occasional and very briefperiods\\nofgrowth.Itwasaroundthe mid-sixties, too, thatunemployment\\nbegan to shift upwards to a level markedly higherthanthatabout\\nwhich it had oscillated for most oftheperiodsince the Second\\nWorld War. Even before 1966, ofcourse, many majorsectors of the\\neconomy were declining in employment terms.Agriculture , mining,\\nmetalmanufacture, shipbuilding, textiles,clothing,transport... all\\nhad been losing jobssince well before the mid-sixties. Indeed,\\nproduction industries as a whole were showing employment decline.\\nBut in 1966 manyoftheindustries associated withpost-war growth\\nbegan to employ fewer people - the SIC Ordersoffood,drinkand\\ntobacco, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering ,construc\\xad\\ntion, gas, electricity and water, and the distributive trades.The\\ngroupsymbolises the building andconsumer boomof the fifties.\\nBetween 1966 and 1979 otherindustries followed, equallysymbo\\xad\\nlically - instrument engineering and public administration. By the\\nendofthe 1970s insurance, banking andfinance, professional\\nservices and miscellaneous services, were the only SIC Ordersstill\\nregistering a net increase in employment.\\nIthas,ofcourse, beenadeclinewhichhasvariedinintensity\\nbetween different partsofthe economy. The old basic sectors,and\\nmechanical and electrical engineering-based means-of-production\\nindustries, declined the fastest, while some consumer andproducer\\nservicescontinued toexpandemployment for much oftheperiod.\\nThe decline has also varied in nature, being morecombined with\\ninvestment and technical change in the early partof theperiod,\\nmoredominated by simple cut-back at the end (Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982). But, in one way or another, employment decline\\nhas been important throughout the period.\\nThe decline in production industries is not,ofcourse,peculiarto\\nBritain.Itistakingplace in most industrialised capitalist countries,\\nand the diminishing proportion ofemployment inmanufacturing is\\na reflection oflong-term and generalised changes in thelabour\\nprocess and the division oflabour.Theabsolute decline in the\\nnumberof people employed in manufacturing is alsocommon to a\\nlargenumberofcountries .Thefactthatthisgeneralised downturn\\ntookplaceratherearlierinBritainthanelsewhere, and thatit has 130SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nbeenmoresevere, is a reflection ofthelong-term structural\\nweaknesses in British economy and society. In the contextofa\\nshiftinginternational divisionoflabourand,later, aslowdown in\\nthe world capitalist economy as a whole, these structural weak\\xad\\nnesses came home to roost.\\nIt was all this thatlay behind the decline. The crises in major\\nsectionsoftheeconomy have been accompanied by aheightened\\nconflictofinterest,if not always explicit conflict, between different\\nsectionsofsociety, and particularly betweencapitalandlabour.As\\nonprevious occasions , too, a shift in international position has had\\nits moredetailedreflection in the internalgeography ofthecountry.\\nMuchofthe restofthebookconcerns precisely this.\\n* * *One thing can be notedbriefly now: the periodsince the mid-1960s\\nhas been very different from the shift in the international order\\nwhichovertook theUnitedKingdom in the early decades ofthis\\ncentury. Inparticular itcontrasts with the thirties.Forthis is a\\ndifferent kind of changeinBritain\\'s place in the world. In the\\nthirtiesthe final end of economic dominance was signalled by the\\nheadlong collapse ofa small numberofparticular, thoughvery\\nmajor,primary andsecondary sectors. Since the 1960s it has not\\nbeen the end oftheEmpirewhich has been at issue, but more\\ngenerally the UnitedKingdom as amanufacturing economy. The\\ndeclinehas been far morewidespread, encompassing mostof\\nmanufacturing industry, and it has also had a different geogra\\xad\\nphy. The decline oftheindustries on which imperial dominance was\\nbuiltdragged down whole regions with it, butit leftotherpartsof\\nthecountry, notably themidlands andthesouthandeastof\\nEngland, relatively intact.This time the patternis different. The\\nverygenerality ofmanufacturing decay means thatfew areas have\\nescaped entirely. But it is the old manufacturing specialists which\\nhave,inevitably, beenhardesthit - the north-west ofEngland, and\\nthe west midlands. In theperiodsince the early sixties the latter\\nregion has plummeted down the regional rankings. Ithas left the\\ncore and joinedtheperiphery, indeed the whole line between the\\ntwo has been redrawn. Over this period,too, it has become clear\\nthatthe old \\'regional\\' level (in the formalsenseofStandard\\nRegions) is less and less relevant for drawing mapsofindustrial\\nchange,orcharting relativeprosperity and decline. Fromthe mid\\xad\\n1960sto the mid-1970s the biggest disparities inemployment decline\\nwere not interregional but between the cities and the non-conurba- SomeChanging SpatialStructures in the UK 131\\ntion areas (Fothergill andGudgin, 1979; Keeble, 1980). The cities\\nhave suffered heavily, and for a whole range ofreasons.Ithas not\\nprimarily been a result of the concentration thereofoldindustries,\\nthoughthis has had some partto play.Ithasratherbeen because\\nthe cities tendedto have the olderandmorelabour-intensive\\ncapacity within any sector,andweretherefore more liable to suffer\\nfromprogrammes ofcapacity-cutting andtechnical change,and\\nfrom the fact thatwhatnewinvestment wasavailable soughtout the\\nattractions oflessurbanareas.The decline in the cities, bothwithin\\nDevelopment Areas(Newcastle, Merseyside, Clydeside) andin the\\nnon-assisted areas(London, Coventry), hasagaintherefore notjust\\nbeen a simple parallelofthe thirties; the economic changesto which\\nthis decline is a response aredifferent fromthoseoffifty years ago.\\nButjobloss in the old basic industries oftheDevelopment Areas\\nhascontinued at a high rate, although unevenly, throughout the\\nperiod.In coal, in steel andinshipbuilding, huge declines in\\nemployment havetakenplace. As we shall see, this process has\\nbeen of fundamental importance in the whole wider patternof\\ngeographical changeinindustry as a whole. Ithasenabled the\\ncreation ofabrandnew reserve of labour,a reserve which has\\nfunctioned indifferent ways atdifferent timesandindifferent parts\\nof theeconomy . Thecontinuing declineofthe basic sectorshas also\\nremained a keycomponent of political relations,againchanging in\\nitsnaturebutalmostalways being significant.\\n* * *Theperiodsince the early 1960s, then, has been characterised by\\nnational-level economic declineandstagnation, apersistent regional\\nproblem, aninability torethinkthe conflict between a traditional\\ninternational orientation and the presentpressing needsofthe\\ndomestic economy , and along-term classstalemate. But it has not\\nbeen astaticstalemate , anequilibrium . On the contrary, theperiod\\nsince the early sixties has seen a shiftingsearch for a solution at the\\npolitical level. Different political alliances have been constructed, a\\nvarietyofstrategies have been tried, andregional policy and spatial\\npolicies more generally have risen andfallen intheirimportance and\\nchanged anumber oftimes in theirnature.Theaimofthe\\nremaining chapters is to use this period,beginning in the early\\n1960s, to explore andillustrate someoftheconcepts andthe\\napproach outlined in the first halfof thisbook.Threedifferent\\nslices are takenthrough theproblem. The rest ofthischapter\\nexamines changes in anumberofindustrial sectors; Chapter 5 132SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ntakes aspatially-defined focus and looks at the impactofthese\\nchanges in specific areas, and Chapter 6 examines variations over\\ntime.\\nTheremainder ofthischapter, then, explores the changing spatial\\nstructures ofa fewmajorsectors of the economy . Eachsectorhas\\nbeen affected by the shiftingeconomic andpolitical circumstances\\noftheperiod,but each has been affected in different ways. The\\nresponses have likewise been different. The pointofthediscussions\\nisnottopresentdatabut toreconceptualise it. Each discussion\\nstartsfrom an SIC definition ofapartoftheeconomy andexplores\\nwhatdifferent kindsofcapitaloperatewithin it. Each startsfrom\\nchangesinemployment patternand asks what spatialstructures of\\ntherelations ofproduction underlie these patterns.Whatis at issue\\nis the way in which contrasting sectionsofBritishcapitalhave been\\nreorganising themselves intonewspatialstructures, eachofwhich\\nforms the basis for new kinds ofgeographical differentiation, and\\nwhichtogether are animportant element in the changing intrana\\xad\\ntionalspatialdivisionoflabour.\\n4.2 Electronics and instruments industries\\nThe character ofthe industry\\nThegroupofproducts classified underthegeneralheading of\\n\\'electronics\\'has been a focus of growththroughout thepost-war\\nperiod.Evenafterthe mid-sixties employment in this field in the\\nUnitedKingdom continued toexpandquiterapidly,thoughby the\\nearly 1980s there was job-losseven here. Nonethe less the size of\\ntheindustry inemployment terms, and its relatively fast growth,\\nmeansthatit has been a significant elementshapingthechanging\\nindustrial geography oftheUnitedKingdom over much of the\\nperiod.Itis also an industry which has gained world-wide notoriety\\nbothsocially and spatially. Socially for the enormous contrasts\\nwhich it encompasses, from the jet-setting microchip scientist/\\ninventor/entrepreneur, male and flying Ambassador Class, to the\\nyoungassembler ofsemiconductors, female, paid around20 cents\\nanhour(in the 1970s), andlikely to lose her jobin acoupleof years,\\nif thecompany hasanywaynotmoved on by then, as her eyesight\\nfails.

Itdoesn\\'tjuststretch, it is\\ndeliberately spaced, from Palo Alto, California , to theMasanFree\\nProduction Zone,SouthKorea.\\nThis is an international spatialstructure, oneofthe classic\\ncornerstones of the new international divisionoflabour.And it is\\nwithinthatoverallcontextthatthespatialorganisation ofthe\\nelectronics industry inanyone country mustbe set. It is an\\ninternational divisionoflabourwhich has only really takenshape\\nsince the 1960s. \\'Itwas not until 1966 ...thatworldmanufacturers\\nbegan to appreciate theadvantage ofusingKorea\\'sabundance of\\ncheap, diligent labour\\'(TheTimes.26September 1975;quotedin\\nFroebel,Heinrichs andKreye, 1980). Since then, each .national\\ngeographical structure has reflected in its own reorganisation this\\nmassivereorientation ofworldproduction .\\n* * *In the United Kingdom, the initial post-war growthofthegroupof\\nindustries known as \\'electronics\\' wasoverwhelmingly concentrated\\nin thesouth-east especially in GreaterLondon, with asubcentre in\\nthenorth-west ofEngland, primarily aroundtheManchester region.\\nAs late as 1959, the earliest datefor which precise figures are\\navailable, over 60 per cent of jobsin theindustry were in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, with the north-west trailing second with 8\\nper cent (Keeble, 1976). Such sectoralconcentration mirrored that\\nofotherindustries in the same period,and waspartofthepatternof\\nregionaldifferentiation basedprimarily onsectoraldifference. Since\\nthen, this patternhas begun to change,primarily intraregionally but\\nalsointerregionally . While the south-east\\'s sharehas fallen only\\nslightly,otherregions, in particular Scotland, have increased theirs.\\nWithin regions, and particularly within the south-east, there has\\nbeenmarkeddecentralisation (Keeble, 1976). While London\\'s share\\nhas slumped, stretches of theoutermetropolitan area and beyond\\nhave witnessed majorgrowth,bothabsolutely and relatively. Two\\nareasofmajorexpansion since the fifties have been the New Towns\\nofScotland andtheareabetween London,Southampton and\\nBristol. But a wide range ofotherareas, from the coalfields of\\nsouthWales to the coastalresortsofthesouth-west, experienced\\nsomeexpansion .\\nBehind these descriptive statistics lies arestructuring of British\\nelectronics in the contextofworld-wide reorganisation, and a shift\\nin theindustry\\'s useofthe British space. While employment\\ncontinued to grow through the sixties and much ofthe seventies 134SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ntheindustry none the less faced fiercer competition internationally\\nfrom the mid-1960s onwards. Whole sections ofit came under\\npressure to cut costs. The increasing vulnerability, particularly in\\nthecapitalgoodssections, brought apolitical as weIl as an\\neconomic response. The importance ofthispartoftheeconomy\\nbothinincreasing productivity over theeconomy as a whole and in\\nbeing\\'thenewtechnology \\' gave it a political centrality which,\\nalthough it varied greatly in importance ,remained throughout the\\nperiod.Stateintervention ,exhortation and aid were important now\\nin thefurtherevolution oftheindustry,justas they had been in its\\nbirth. Thiscombination ofincreased competitive pressure andState\\naid had a dual effect. First,itencouraged , over the late sixties in\\nparticular ,changes in thestructure andorganisation ofcapital.\\nOwnership wasconsolidated and there was a significant increase in\\nthe sizeofthemajorindividual companies . This in turnenabledthe\\nfinancing ofthe second development: anacceleration oftechnolo\\xad\\ngical change within the production process itself, in response to the\\nincreased pressure to cut costs and especiaIly to increase labour\\nproductivity. Together with the development ofnewproducts and\\ntypesofcomponents, this led to increases in the importance of\\nstandardisation andofmass-production. These were not brandnew\\nchanges. They were reinforcements of existing processes (long-term\\ntechnolog icalchange; the rise in importance ofcommodities and\\ncomponents which could be produced bymass-production techni\\xad\\nques), but as a result ofchanged economic conditions they became\\nmoreimportant.\\nNorwerethesechanges characteristic ofthewholeofthe\\nelectronics industry. The word \\'electronics\\' refers to the technologi\\xad\\ncalnatureofthecommodity produced, but thecharacter ofcapital\\nengaged in thatproduction varies widely. To begin with, there are\\ndifferences of product andofplace in the economy. \\'Electronics\\'\\ncovers the range from militaryequipment throughcomputers for use\\ninadvanced production processes to TV games. These differences are\\nmirrored inothers.Militaryelectronics andadvanced computers are\\nat thefront-end oftechnological development, heavilyresearch\\xad\\norientated ,fast-changing and with an emphasis on theunstandar\\xad\\ndised.At theotherend, the manufacture bothofconsumer\\nelectronics andofcomponents such as integrated circuitsand\\nsemiconductors is geared towardslarge-scale mass-production and\\nuniformity. Itis not,though,justaquestion ofproduct. Thereare\\nalsootherconsiderable contrasts between firms \\'in electronics\\'.

At theotherendofthe spec\\xad\\ntrum,thedistribution ofhighly-trained andhighly-paid technical\\nandscientific workers wasofincreasing locational significance.\\nThequestion ofwhodoeswhatjobin thepresentorganisation of\\ntheelectronics industryhas been firmly answered, as has the social\\nstatuswhich is deemed to goalongwith each, statusinsideand\\noutsidetheworkplacereinforcing eachothertoproduce a rigidly\\nhierarchised social system ofproduction.Thetechnical ,research\\nanddevelopment workisoverwhelmingl ydonebygraduates : it is 136SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nalso,although this is in no way required by thenatureof thejob,\\nalmostalwaysdoneby men.

This is usually arguedto be a result\\nof therequirements ofproduction becauseofwomen\\'s supposedly\\ngreater\\'dexterity\\' . \\'Aspokesman fromInmosadmitted recently\\nthatthecompany wouldbeoffering \"thesortofdetailed, fiddly\\njobsthataretraditionally doneby women: they have a special\\naptitude forthatkind of work\\'\" (Marks, 1980). As Markspoints\\nout,\\'Female workers come at special prices too\\'. Ifdexterity really\\nis the issue it seems surprising thatnotmorewomenget to do the\\ndetailed, fiddlyjobofbrainsurgery.Itis not, in the end, much to\\ndo with the requirements ofproduction in atechnical sense; it is\\nmuch more to do with the fact thatwho does whatjobispartand\\nparcel of the reproduction ofsocialstructures in society as a whole.\\nMuchthe same applies to the low skill statusattached toelectronics\\nassembly .WalkerandStorper (1982) argue thatsemiconductor\\nassembly skills are often objectively higher thanthoserequired in\\ncar assembly. Whatisdifferent aboutthelabourprocessisthatthe\\ntasks are less technically interdependent andhighturnover conse\\xad\\nquentlyless of a preoccupation withmanagement.

The high levels ofturnover combine\\nwith the lack ofunionattention to women workers\\' statustoensure\\nthatthe official skill definition of the work will remainlow.\\nEachofthesepartsofthelabourforce -different socialgroups\\xad\\noperates indifferent ways as a \\'location factor\\'; the way it affects Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 137\\nthelocationofindustry isdifferent in each case.

Thispartof thelabourforce\\nisoverwhelmingly concentrated in theoutermetropolitan areaof\\nthesouth-east ofEngland, stretching intoHampshire, EastAnglia\\nand west towards Bristol. Buswell and Lewis (1970) showedthatin\\n1968, 63 per cent of electronics engineers in theUnitedKingdom\\nlived in the south-east ofEngland.Thereareotherclusters, notably\\ninnorthCheshire, and in the Edinburgh area,but by far the largest\\nconcentration of these social stratawas inEngland\\'s \\'sunbelt\\'.Itis\\nalso to this areaaboveallthattheRand0partofelectronics has\\ngravitated. Theinteresting question is \\'why?\\' Whatliesbehindthis\\nclustering and the choice of these particular locations?\\nThereappearsfor thispartofthelabourforce to be an intimate\\nandmutually-reinforcing relation between location andsocial\\nstatus.Industries cometo these partsofthecountry, cluster\\nbetween the Solent andtheCotswolds, becausethatis where these\\npeopleare.Thereareotherreasons, too, which we shall take up in\\nlaterchapters, but the simple presence of these partsof thelabour\\nforce isofimmense importance . This is not, though, amiddle-class\\nequivalent oftakingwork to the workers, believed to be a social\\nprinciple behindregional policy. These workers are highly mobile;\\nthey are not stuck,norare they moving aboutthecountryin search\\nofemployment.

Thislabourmarketdoes not operatein\\ntermsofsimpleavailability, ofnumerical supply and demand.

Thenatureofcompetition in theseindustries reinforces\\nthe significance of this. Firmscompete through technology and\\nthroughquality,innovation and new products, at least as much as\\nthrough price.Whatis being boughton thelabourmarketisnot\\njustlabourpowerbut scientific knowledge. Poaching between\\ncompanies iscommon. \\'Some... hightechnology companies . . .\\nhaveattempted to tie up their expert employees with contracts that\\npreventthem from competing with their employer for several years\\nafterthey leave\\' (Kehoe, 1982a). Legal battlesarequitecommon.\\nThis, then, is a highly differentiated labourmarketcreating a\\ndynamic ofcompetition in which it is necessary for bothsides,\\nemployer and employee, to have detailedknowledge of themarket;\\nto be in on the scene.

On the whole,\\nwages are higher,the degree oftradeunionorganisation stronger\\nand things such as absenteeism lower where such workers have less\\nhistoryofemployment incapitalist wagerelations. Thereare\\ntherefore locational advantages , so far as access to this kind of\\nlabourisconcerned, where there are reserves ofnewworkers\\ncomingon to the capitalist labourmarketfor the first time.

Theimportant characteristic ofthislatterpart\\nofproduction, however, is thatit isdeclining. Investment in the new\\ntechnology nolongerrequires suchlocations; being freed from its\\nprevious ties to skilled labour,newinvestment can now be made in\\nthe\\'bottom-rung \\' regions ofthehierarchy .Thisprocessisspeeded\\nup because ofthe overall lack ofgrowth, for even while industry\\ncontinues toupdateitstechniques in the face ofincreasingly severe\\ncompetition, itcannotaffordin many cases to expanditsoutput\\nsignificantly.

This is the experimental/developmental\\nfirst stage ofproduction ofa newproduct. It differs in a numberof\\nways from the production processes justdescribed . It isnot\\ndeclining, for it is at the new end ofthe process oftechnological\\nchange. Moreover, thelabourrequirements areratherdifferent.\\nMuchofthelaboursoughtmay in fact be ofthe assembly-line,\\nsemi-skilled type, but precisely because this is an experimental stage\\nofproduction there is a requirement also for skilled labour,and the\\nskillsrequired will benotonlyofthe\\'old-fashioned\\' engineering\\ntype but also new technical skills. This difference in labourtype\\ncombines -with the need for contactwith centres ofRandD to\\ninfluence the location ofsuch facilities. Such production is then,\\nveryfrequently, in or close to the \\'top-end\\' regions of the hierarchy.\\nFinally, these top-end regions themselves are defined by the\\nlocation within them oftheupperechelons of all the hierarchies.\\nTheyinclude thetopmanagerial staffwiththeirassociated\\nfunctions ofownership and overall control, theRandDworkers\\nwith their functions ofconceptualisation, and the early develop\\xad\\nmental stages oftheproduction process itself, including assembly,\\ncraftand technical workers. As we have seen, within the United\\nKingdom thisconstellation offunctions and social strataoccurs\\nabove all in the southand eastofEngland, withoutliersparticularly\\nin thenorthCheshire area(southofManchester) and in the south\\xad\\neastofScotland, especially aroundEdinburgh.\\nAll these spatialstructures ofbig firms in electronics shareone\\nfeature, the locational separation ofresearch from production . Such\\nseparation is not always simply a response to highly differentiated\\nlocational requirements .Spatialstructures areestablished through\\nsocial processes. In the early days ofelectronics many firms with a\\nlonghistoryin electrical engineering, staidandworthyin their own\\nfields but nonetheless on a loser, tried to keep abreastofthe times\\nby moving into electronics . Suchcompanies had well established\\nstructures, theirpersonnel were set in their ways, and the new\\ngrowthwas seen as potentially disruptive . Inpartthis was precisely\\nbecause it wasgrowing, and at the expense oftheelectrical\\nengineers, andinpartit wasbecause thewholeethoswas Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 143\\ndifferent; old-time engineers facedelectronics whizz-kids. The\\nanswerto the social problem wasoftenspatialseparation. Burns\\nandStalker(1961)document manysuch cases (one, indeed,where\\nspatialseparation wasreduced to the effective andtellingsymbo\\xad\\nlism ofbuilding a brick wall through theplant!)in theScottish\\nindustry of the 1950s.

The solution, again, has often been spatialseparation .\\n\\'The way outofthesetroubleswas seen by the headsoffirms to liein\\nseparating the new groupas far as possible, administratively and\\nphysically, from the existing establishment.

Some non-UK firms have only production facilities\\nhere,American firms in Scotland for example, and German and\\nJapanese companies in Wales. The orientation ofthedifferent\\nregions reflects the international position too. While partsofthe\\nsouth-east try tocompete with Silicon Valley the regions with only\\nassembly jobsmay loseeven them to a ThirdWorldFreeProduction\\nZone, or win production back only when there has been sufficient\\nautomation to reduce substantially thecriticalimportance oflabour\\ncosts, and therefore thenumberofjobs. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 145\\nSpatial structures ofsmallfirms\\nBut not all firms, by any means, could adoptthis kind ofspatial\\nstructure. There is within the electronics and instruments industries\\na range of companies which are different in two crucial respects\\nfrom those so far discussed: in the character of the capital involved\\nand in the nature ofthedominant labourprocess. These companies\\nare small, often entrepreneurial operations, and they do not on the\\nwhole use mass-production techniques. These two closely-linked\\naspects-capitalorganisation andlabourprocess-together\\ncondition a locational strategy which is very different from the\\nspatialstructures just described, but which none the less reinforces\\nsome of their regional effects.\\nThis is, parexcellence .smallcapitaloftheventuresome,\\nadvanced-technology variety. In spite ofits size it operates in an\\ninternational scene. Its smallness is partly a reflection of the nature\\nofthelabourprocess. Much production ofinstruments and\\nadvanced electronics takes place on a small-batch basis, is labour\\nintensive, and is geared to competition based less on cost than on\\ntechnological characteristics. Production is often for specialised\\nmarkets, often on the basis of customer specification, and requires\\ndevelopment ofandadaptation to acontinually changing technol\\xad\\nogy. There are few opportunities formass-production and fewalso\\nforeconomiesofscale.\\nLabourrequirements clearly reflect these characteristics. Soft\\xad\\nwarescientists, microchip people and technologists are very\\nimportant. Manualworkers, too, tend to be specialised and highly\\nskilled, and the most significant aspect of this skill is adaptability.\\nThe work is non-repetitive, with a high degree of on-the-job\\ncontrol.\\nAll this determines a veryparticular setofconstraints on\\nlocation. The small size of the firms means thatit is difficult to\\nlocate research and production separately. The frequent one-offor\\nsmall-batch character cuts down on the possibilities for mass\\xad\\nproduction and requires a much more intimate relation between\\nresearch, development and operations on the shop floor. These\\nthings together immediately rule out a spatial structure of the\\nmultiregional, hierarchical, part-process variety. These companies\\nare single-region affairs and usually also single-location. Further,\\nthedemand for skilled labourrestricts the range of possible\\nlocations, concentrating themparticularly , and once again, in the 146SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nsouth-east of England. This applies not only to the research kind of\\nskilledlabourbut also to the technically skilled shop-floor workers,\\nwho often do jobs which precisely involve the integration of\\nconception and execution (Oakey, 1978) .5Some evidence indicates\\nthat,although thesouth-east does not in fact always have slacker\\nmarketsfor such labour,it is often nonetheless perceived to be a\\nbetterregion for bothskilled operative and administrative labour\\n(Oakey, p. 207).The resulting concentration of these firms thus\\nreinforces the region\\'s existing dominance in the distribution of\\nskilled and technical workers. And numerous studies show thatthis\\ndifferential distribution of \\'key workers\\' is real as wellas perceived.\\nOne of the cases Oakey presents is of a small company (about150\\nworkers) which was trying to concentrate a previous hierarchically\\xad\\nstructured location pattern.Whatis more, it was attempting\\nconsolidation in the lower end of the hierarchy, in a Development\\nArea. A manufacturing plant at Camberley, Surrey, which had 20\\nper cent of the organisation\\'s totalmanufacturing, and all the\\ncompany\\'s administration and research and development facilities,\\nwas closed in 1977, and the activities moved to an existing\\nproduction plant at Runcorn. The Runcorn planthad been in\\noperation since1968on a new government-built factory estate and\\nhad previously had 80 per cent of the company\\'s production, but\\nalmost no administration (p.275).\\nThe decision to consolidate on the Runcorn site was governed by\\ntwofactors- thesmallerdisruption toproduction and the\\navailability of regional policy assistance. But problems arose in\\nattracting skilledlabour.First, only a small proportion ofthe\\n\\'highly skilled technical and administrative staffcould be per\\xad\\nsuaded to move north. Second, \\'a shortage of \"local scientific\\nengineering and skilled manpower\" (questionnaire response) that\\nhad been present since the Runcorn plant\\'sinitialestablishment in\\n1968,havingintensified since the Camberley relocation, had\\nvirtually forced the company to close the Runcorn plant\\'(p.276).\\nThe plant did survive - with the help oftheTemporary Employ\\xad\\nment Subsidy - but the example illustrates well the kinds of\\nconditions which might keep in the south-east boththatpartof\\nthese industries which requires predominantly skilled and technical\\nlabour,andthatpartwhich consists of firms which, though they\\nmay have some processes performed by semi-skilled labour,are too\\nsmall to establish a hierarchical spatial structure. No mention is\\nmadeofanyattempts by firms to train their own labour. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 147\\nThis, however, is an example ofanattempted move to the\\nindustrial periphery .Thereis more evidence ofsuccessful moves\\nby such firms to the ruralregionsbordering thesouth-east, and in\\nparticular thesouth-west ofEngland andEast Anglia. In these\\nregions the environmental preferences ofmanagerial and technical\\nstaffare more likely to be met (Spooner, 1972;Cornwall Industrial\\nDevelopment Association, 1977).Indeed,oneofthecomplaints in\\nthesouth-west isthattoo many ofthesejobsare taken by in\\xad\\nmigrants -thoughclearly there are exceptions even here (see\\nNote5). The evidence is, however, thateven in these regions such\\nmovesprovideonly aminority ofincoming employment, the bulk\\nof it being production work inbranchplants.Moreover ,although\\nresidential preference has been important inattracting such firms to\\nthe regions it has not saved them from a faster-than-average closure\\nrate in recent years (Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b;Cornwall\\nIndustrial Development Association, 1977).\\nThispartoftheindustry bears witness againto the negative\\nsocialpoweroverlocation of\\'thebeststaff\\'. They could not be\\npersuaded to go to Runcorn, and in St Austell there was a lack of\\nartisticandcultural entertainments : theinterpenetration ofthe\\neconomic and the social again. Whathasartisticentertainment got\\nto do with makingaprofitinelectronics? It is not a demandofthe\\nproduction process directly. But the technology being developed in\\nelectronics is based on a division oflabourwhichincreasingly\\nseparates conceptualisation fromexecution, and the social polarisa\\xad\\ntion with which this is associated is inpartthecondition for, and in\\npartreinforced by,ideological factorswhich go far beyond\\nproduction. The kinds ofsocialstratawhich occupy the top end\\nofbothmanagerial andproduction -technology hierarchies in these\\nindustries have been centralto therhetoricofeconomic strategy\\nthroughout theperiodsince the sixties, thoughin vastly varying\\nways. In the sixties they were the linchpin oftheState-backed white\\nheatoftechnological, andmanagerial, revolution. By the eighties\\nthey were transformed, at least ideologically, intothedynamic\\nentrepreneurs (thetwo-men-in-a-garage), towhatwould be left\\nwhen the dead wood ofBritishindustry (andStateintervention)\\nhad been cut away, when they would have space to breathe,expand,\\nand save the economy . Inbothguises they manifestly failed, but\\ntheir social statusremained untarnished . Thedevelopment ofa\\nparticular social form and ideology ofthetechnology ofproduction\\nis theprecondition for aparticular formofgeographical differ- 148SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nentiation. Equally, geographical form itselfcan help to reinforce the\\nsocial divisiveness of a division of labourwithinproduction.\\nAs itstandsatpresent, then, the spatialstructure most\\ncharacteristic of this kind of smaller company is that of geographi\\xad\\ncalconcentration . All stages of production as wellas of ownership\\nandmanagement are in general to be found in one area. And being\\nable neither to establish a hierarchical spatial structure nor to\\ndecentralise the whole of production they were unable to take the\\nsameadvantage of the existing form of geographical inequality.\\nClearly, therefore, it is not possible to generalise aboutthe spatial\\nstructures ofthetechnologically-advanced/means-of-production\\npartsofthe economy. For these firms, the characteristics of the\\nlabourprocess and oftheorganisation of capital were far more\\nimportant determinants of locational structure.\\nNevertheless, this spatial structure reinforces, although it does\\nnot replicate, the patternofspatialdifferentiation implied by the\\nlocational hierarchies of production characteristic ofotherpartsof\\nelectronics and related industries. Itreinforces the concentration of\\nsupply and demand for particular kinds of skilled labourin the\\nsouthand east, and it reinforces the concentration of ownership,\\nandofuppermanagement andcontrol, in the same area. The\\nlocational structure ofsuch firms thus contributes further to the\\nreproduction ofthe differential distribution withinGreatBritain\\nboth of capital itself and of its immediate representatives , and of\\nelements of those stratawhich Wright places between the working\\nclass and the petty bourgeoisie.\\n4.3 Clothingandfootwear\\nThe character ofthe industry: increasing pressures\\nEmployment in the clothing and footwear industry in the United\\nKingdom has been declining for decades. This is an old industry,\\ngrown out of domestic production of essential consumer goods,\\nrising tonationalsignificance in the nineteenth century, to undergo\\nsince the Second World War, and especially since the 1960s, a\\nradical shift in location away from industrialised capitalist countries\\nof the first world. Itisan industry which wasearly in, and has been\\ncentral to, the emergence of a new international division of labour.\\nThedramatic decline in employment has not prevented, however, Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 149\\ntheevolution ofnewspatialstructures within the UnitedKingdom .\\nIndeed, the pressures which have brought aboutdecline also lie\\nbehind those new structures. Decline is not necessarily a process of\\nstagnation orofsimple closure; it can also involve quite dramatic\\nreorganisation.\\n\\'Clothing\\', then, is a very different industry, with a very different\\nhistory and place in the economy, from those we have looked at so\\nfar. These contrasts meanthatfirms in the clothing industry are\\nsubject to different economic pressures and also adoptdifferent\\nlocational strategies .Descriptively, thegeographical patternof\\nemployment inclothing and the present changes in thatpattern\\nare well known and undisputed. The decline in jobs(thoughnot in\\noutput)islong-term ,thoughvarying in pace. The geographical\\nchanges are again long-term, but they accelerated between the mid\\n1960s and early 1970s. The mainshifts have been from the\\ntraditional centresofLondon, WestYorkshire andManchester\\ntowards both rural areas and peripheral regions. The change can\\nthus be described on two axes: on the one handfrommajorurban\\nareastowardssmaller towns and rural partsofthecountry; and on\\ntheotherfromnon-Development Areastowards Development\\nAreas.\\nThis, however, is justadescription ofthetwo-dimensional\\npattern.Whatlies behind it is a complicated setofchanges, both\\nin theorganisational structure ofcapitaland in the relations\\nbetween capital and labour.\\nInorderto examine this furtherit is necessary to look first at the\\ncharacteristics ofcapitalin thisindustry.Forthe\\'Clothing and\\nFootwear\\' OrderoftheStandard Industrial Classification is a\\nclassic case where, because they produce the same kind ofoutput,\\nvery different kinds of firms are aggregated together underone\\nheading. In terms oftheorganisation ofcapital,thenatureof\\nproduction relations andmanagement, and therelationto technol\\xad\\nogy and to the market,theclothing industry is split into a number\\nofdifferent parts. At least two significantly different kinds of\\ncapitaloperatewithin it.\\nAnimportant segmentoftheindustry is owned by small capital.\\nBut this is not the small capitalofelectronics and instruments\\nproduction . As in those sectors, the survival and importance of\\nsmallcompanies is inpartdue to the lack ofeconomies ofscale in\\nproduction . But in total contrast to theinstruments industry, this is\\nhere aresult,notofthecontinuously advancing natureof 150SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ntechnology, butofthe fact thatit isbackward andrelatively\\nstagnant. The basic labourprocess in the clothing industry remains\\norganised around theindividually-operated sewingmachine \\xad\\nconveyor-belt production is stillunusual (NEOO, 1974a;Econo\\xad\\nmistsAdvisory Group,undated) .Although there are differences,\\nthiskindoflabourprocess isbroadly typicalthroughout the\\nindustry. The small firms, however, tend to be concentrated in\\nthosepartsofthesectorwhich are as yet least mechanisable and\\nwhere long runs and mass-production are rare. This varies both\\nbetween mlhs and between partsofthemarket(depending on the\\ndegreeof\\'fashion-orientation\\', etc.). The social natureofthese\\nfirms isdifferent too. Inclothing, small firms tend to be in rather\\nunentrepreneurial family-ownership and this in turnmeansthatthe\\ntechnological backwardness isreinforced by the\\'old-fashioned \\'\\nnatureof much ofthemanagement in theindustry. ANEOO\\nReportcommented thatit wasofacharacter tomanageacraft\\nindustryoflowtechnological content, smallcapitalinvestment and\\nshortturnover times, but thatanyattempt to raise-technological\\nlevelsand capitalintensity wouldcreate\\'largeproblems inmanage\\xad\\nmenteducation \\'(NEOO, 1974c).\\nAreporton thefootwear industry came to much the same\\nconclusion aboutthenatureofcapitalandmanagement there.\\nAgain in totalcontrast to themushrooming new firms in high-tech\\nsectors, firms in footwear tend to be old. \\'Very few new footwear\\ncompanies have been formed since the Second WorldWar and the\\nmajority ofthemedium andlargecompanies datefromthe\\nnineteenth century\\' (Economists Advisory Group,undated, p. 95).\\nThischaracteristic inturnhas resulted in a relatively high average\\nageofmanagements in family businesses, much of it in its secondor\\nthirdgeneration .\\'Anageingstructure ofenterprise andmanage\\xad\\nment is, it appears, a general characteristic ofUKindustry, but it\\nmay beexceptionally pronounced in thefootwear industry where, in\\nthenatureofthings,technological changehas been relatively slow\\'\\n(Economists Advisory Group,p. 95). This is for the industry as a\\nwhole, but there are clear divisions within it: \\'Thegeneralqualityof\\nmanagement in theindustry ispoorexcept in the few very large\\nmanufacturers where it is professional, trainedandcompetent\\'\\n(p. 130).

Theadvantages they gain from size are different.\\nCertainly, largefirmsaremorecommon in themore-easily\\nmechanisable partsoftheindustry, and where mass-production is\\nmorefeasible. They are, therefore, able to take some advantage of\\neconomies ofscale in production , but even in these partsofthe\\nsector(for example, shirtproduction) sucheconomies are relatively\\nlimited. The real advantages of size lie in the ability to dominate\\nmarketrelations, particularly with the distribution sector.\\nItisgenerally recognised thatthese two partsofthesector- small\\nfirmsandlarge - have behaved ratherdifferently in thepost-war\\nperiod, the former experiencing greaterdecline, the lattersome\\nexpansion andgreatermobility (primarily byestablishing new\\nbranchplantsin newlocations) .

However, because ofthesector\\'svery\\ndifferent structural position within the economy, the effects of these\\ndevelopments onclothing firms were not the same as the effects in\\nelectronics andinstruments. The recession hit different partsofthe\\neconomy in verydifferent ways.Over the long term, but particularly\\nsince the mid-I960s, the clothing industry has come underincreas\\xad\\ningpressure to cut its costs ofproduction .Mostobviously there has\\nbeencompetition fromimports (fromtheThirdWorld,from\\nComecon, from the UnitedStates) which couldout-compete the\\nproducts made in Britainlargely because they were cheaper.More\\xad\\nover, at the same time as the home markethas been invaded by\\nimports it has been slowing down in its overall rate ofgrowth\"\\n(reportsofClothing SectorEDC).

In the 1960s, this supply\\nwassupplemented byimmigration , but with political changes this\\nsourceofnewlabourbegan to diminish also(Winyard, 1977).

A study by the Clothing EDC,\\nreported on in 1980, foundlow pay to be the majorfactor\\ninfluencing peopleto leave the industry (NEDO, 1980), with\\nboredom coming second. Pay was particularly significant in\\nLondon - a reflection ofgeographical variation incompetition\\nforlabour. Thiscompares with an earlier study (NEDO, 1967) in\\nwhichboredom emerged as the single majorfactor. Wagecompeti\\xad\\ntion was relatively late on the scene. Indeed from the mid-1960s the\\ndisparity between wages for women in the clothing industry and in\\nmanufacturing as a whole increased dramatically .From98.4 per\\ncentofall-manufacturing average in 1965, women\\'s wages in\\nclothing fell to 89.4 per cent in 1970 and to 82.1 per cent in 1978\\n(Department ofEmployment data). This steep relative fall reflects\\ntheincreasing pressure on theindustry over this period; it also\\nreflects the ways in which capitalresponded. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 155\\nThe search fornew labour: two different strategies\\nThisresponse mirrored onceagainthe difference between large and\\nsmallcapitalin theindustry. The two behaved verydifferently .\\nManyvery small firms are more tied to the traditional andurban\\nareasofproduction, bothbecause they tend to bemoregearedinto\\nthe fashion end ofproduction (the existence ofwhich is itselfone of\\ntheconditions for the survival ofsmallcapitalin thesector)and,\\nmoreimportantly, because their very smallness andtheirfamily\\nnaturemeansthatthey are less able to respond tochanging cost\\npressures through geographical mobility. And it is precisely in the\\nurbanareaswhere these firms are concentrated thatthemost\\ndramatic increases in pressure on costs have takenplace(Depart\\xad\\nmentofTradeandIndustry, 1973; Keeble, 1976). Small capitalwas\\nthus often left stranded in the face of these rising costs - literally\\nimmobilised .Quitefrequently it gave up the ghost,anddied\\n(Keeble, 1976).\\nForthose small firms which survived it was necessary to reduce\\nlabourcosts while remaining in the same general location. Extensive\\nmechanisation andautomation wereimpossible ,bothbecausesuch\\nfirms did not have sufficient capitalorborrowing potential and\\nbecause such small firms are precisely concentrated in the less\\xad\\nmechanisable partsofthesector.Otherstrategies hadto be\\nadopted. The work process was intensified, thusincreasing its\\nspeed and also its monotony.\" Further, unableto escape from\\ntheseareasofincreasing competition forlabour, small firms turned\\nto more vulnerable sectionsofthelabourforce, in particular to\\nimmigrants andolderandmarried women, andformsoflabour\\norganisation such ashomeworking (which in the late seventies was\\nestimated , see King, 1981, p. 10, to account for 40 per centof\\nproduction inLondon, the highest level in the country) . This\\nreduced the bargaining powerof theworkforce andenabled the\\nemployers thus to hold down wages. Unabletochangelocation to\\nsearch for cheaperlabour,theyturnedtoothersocialstratain their\\nexisting areas and whatcame to be called \\'thenew sweated sector\\'\\ngrew up in London.!\"\\n* **\\nLargerfirms have been in a very different position, andable to\\nadopta verydifferent strategy.First,they were oftenbetterable to 156SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsurvive simply because ofthe extra financial resilience given to them\\nby size. Second, the fact thatthey tended to be in the more easily\\nmechanisable andautomatable partsof thesector, andthatthey\\nhad more capitalto invest, meantthatthey were more able than\\nwere small companies to reduce costs by technological changes in\\ntheproduction process. This allowed them bothto reduce the\\namountoflabourper unit ofoutputand to use the opportunity\\nofthechangeinproduction methodtointroduce cheaperworkers.\\nKing (1981) describes how technological innovation, byallowing\\nthereclassification ofjobs,enabledbetter-paid maleworkers to be\\n\\'boughtout\\'withredundancy payments and women to be employed\\nat a lower rate (Winyard , 1977; Disher, 1980). Such replacement\\nalsooperated between different groupsofwomenworkers. When\\nsearching outnewsourcesoffemalelabour,management in these\\nfirmslookedinparticular for women with no previous experience of\\nworking in theclothing industry.\\nHowever, even amongthe biggest firms the labour-cost savings to\\nbe made by changes inproduction were not major,andother\\nmeasures were also taken.Inparticular, thesecompanies were\\nbetterable to survive because, unlike the small ones, they were\\ngeographicaIly mobile.Insteadofbeingtrappedinhigh-cost areas,\\nthey were able to take advantage ofthechanges going on at the\\nsame time in the geography of the female labourforce. These big\\ncompanies wereunconstrained by the family ties ofownersand\\nmanagers , and they were large enoughand had sufficient capitalto\\ntakeadvantage ofcheaper conditions ofproduction elsewhere in\\nthecountry. Socially, they were a completely different entityfrom\\nthe small companies , and their response was likewise different. And\\nthedifference ingeographical mobility mattered. Thespatial\\npatternofcost and availabilityoflabourwaschanging . While\\ncosts were going up in urbanareas there was a growing female\\nlabourreserveavailable as a result of accelerated declineofmale\\xad\\nemploying industries in theDevelopment Areas,andalsosignificant\\nreserves outsidethemajorcities in smallertowns.IIThese alter\\xad\\nnativesources of female workershadnumerous advantages for the\\nclothing industry.Firstofall, the labourwascheaper. Keeble\\n(1976),summarising theconclusions oftheILAGsurvey,reports\\nthatavailability and cost offemalelabourwere the main factors\\ninducing movement byclothing firms between 1964 and 1967, and\\nininfluencing the choice ofnewlocation. \\'Theestablishment of\\nsmallclothingplantsin many rural and peripheral areas to tap local Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 157\\nsuppliesofunderemployed womenworkers is aprimary reasonfor\\ntherecentdispersal oftheindustry\\' (p. 179).\\nSuchlabourwasnotonlyavailable andcomparatively cheap,it\\nwas also new to the industry.Keeble\\'s (1976)analysis shows\\'avery\\nmarked negative relationship withexisting clothing employment\\',\\nandtheNational UnionofTailors andGarment Workers\\n(NUTGW) reported thatthelaboursoughtby these firms was\\nmainlyfemale,unorganised andnon-trad itionalclothing workers.\\nTherewas far less competition for it from othersectorsthanthere\\nwas inmajorurbanareas.

Smaller, moreperipheral, labourmarkets are ideal (as\\nindeed, in the contextofbigger cities, are homeworkers).\\nLike the small firms in the sector, then, big capitalturnedto more\\nvulnerable sections of theworkforce .

Third,in\\ntheir choice ofnewlocations geographical dispersion andmonopoly\\nover local labourmarketsenabledthese large firms to reinforce the\\nvulnerability of their new employees.\\nSpatialstructures ofbigfirms\\nLet us look moreclosely then at the kind ofspatial structures\\nevolved by these larger multiregional andmultinational companies\\nin theclothing andfootwear industry. How has big capitalin this\\nindustry, anindustry sodifferent fromelectronics, attempted to\\ngainmaximum advantage fromtheexisting formofuneven\\ndevelopment ofthe British space?\\nFirstofall,multiregionality itself means thatthespatialstructure\\nis one in which headquarters functions arecarriedoutin one region\\nwhileproduction in theothersis subject to external ownership and\\nultimatecontrol.Thereis, inotherwords, a hierarchy ofownership,\\nsupervision andcontrol, ahierarchy of therelations ofeconomic\\nownership andpossession. Moreover, increasingly thelocationof\\nheadquarters isinLondon.This results bothfrom the establishment\\nofbranchplantsoutsidethesouth-east by firms already based\\nthere, and from anotherprocess which has been underway at the\\nsame time, thatoftakeover andmerger. This latterprocesshasboth\\nreflected and furtherincreased thestrengthofbig firms in relation\\nto small andhasreinforced thedominance ofLondon as a\\nheadquarters location. Leigh, whose studywasoftakeovers in the\\nsectorin 1973, provides evidence ofhow this processofcentralisa\\xad\\ntion istakingplace largely by moderate-sized andlargercompanies\\ntakingoversmallones(p.12)and, intermsofthebroader\\ncharacteristics ofownership, that\\'themajorpattern. . . isof\\npubliccompanies acquiring privatelimitedcompanies, or, less\\nusually,acquiring thesubsidiaries ofotherpubliccompanies. No\\npubliccompanies were\"acquired\" (Leigh, 1975, p. 5). Moreover,\\nthispatternof typesoffirm ismirrored in ageographical pattern.\\nLeighreportsthatthepictureis one of \\'increasing \"metropolita\\xad\\nnisation\" ofthe United Kingdom clothing industry byLondon\\xad\\nbased firms\\' (p.20). Such companies were at thatperiodactively\\ntakingoversmallerLondon firms as well as provincial companies .\\nTherewas, on the otherhand,littlecounter-provincialisation ofthe\\nindustry \\'sinceprovincially-based firms tend to take over other\\nprovincial firms, not metropolitan ones\\' (Leigh, 1975, p. 20). 160SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThus, aspatialstructure inwhichLondonis the base ofultimate\\ncontroloverinvestment andproduction is increasingly important\\nwithintheindustry. In some cases this base is attached to\\nproduction facilities in the same region, in some cases it is not.\\nTheproduction plantselsewhere are increasingly in rural and /or\\nperipheral regions. This aspect of spatialstructure is increasingly\\ntypicalofthe larger firms in the industry and,therefore , of growing\\nimportance in thesectoras a whole. This is none the lessa sectorin\\nwhich, because ofitshistoricregional bases, quite a fewlarger firms\\nstill have their headquarters outsidethesouth-east (Leigh, 1975).\\nIn its multiregional naturethespatialstructure oflarge firms in\\ntheclothing industry is very like thatof their counterparts in\\nelectronics. In otherways, however, it is clearly different. Ithas\\nalreadybeenmentioned thatthetechnology inclothing meansthat\\ntheadvantages to be derived from size are different from those in\\ntheaatomatable andresearch-based partsofelectronics . In\\nclothing, theadvantages lie in areas otherthandirectproduction\\nand R and D.,This reflects itself in spatialstructure . While this is\\nmultiplant and multi regional location it is not the multiplant\\nstructure characteristic ofelectronics. Itis not a part-process but\\na cloning structure. So, as we have seen, while there is a hierarchy\\nofadministrat ion andcontrol,there is often no hierarchy based on\\na technical division oflabour. Thiscontrast in spatial structure\\naffectsinterregional contrasts. Inclothing thereis little inter\\xad\\nregional difference in the social characteristics ofproduction\\nworkers and because the branchplantsare not embedded in a\\npart-process structure they may be more differentially vulnerable to\\nclosure in economic downturns.\\nThe low levels of technology and division oflabourhaveother\\neffects.This isnot a science-based industry; there isno concentration\\noftechnical and scientific workers in the south-east. The manage\\xad\\nmentstructure oftheadministrative hierarchy isflatter,and there\\xad\\nfore again failsto contribute much to the congregation ofhighly-paid\\nandhigh-status jobsaroundLondon. This also means, ofcourse,\\nthatthe higher proportion ofheadquarters \\'in theregions\\'does not\\nimply a large amountofwhite-collar employment thereeither.\\nThe low level ofdevelopment ofthe technical division oflabour\\nis alsomirrored at theotherendofthespectrum. Justas there has\\nbeen no majorseparate development ofscientific and conceptual\\nfunctions so theproduction jobs are less reduced to repetitive\\nexecution. Clearly theclothing industry, likeelectronics, has Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 161\\ncontributed to the influx ofjobsfor women in ruralareas and\\nperipheral regions. Certainly, too, these jobsare not well paid.\\nIndeed as we have seen the geographical shift itself has been partof\\nthemechanism whereby women\\'s wages in clothing fell behind\\nthose inmanufacturing as a whole. It would be wrong, however, to\\nsee this as entirely unskilled or semi-skilled work. Certainly it has\\nbeen the most mechanisable - and least skilled - sectorswhich have\\ndecentralised. Andlocational changesometimes wenthandinhand\\nwithproduction change. But nevertheless in1971a good 20 per cent\\nof employees even in the most mechanised sectorswere female\\nskilledmanualworkers. This is far above the proportion in any\\nelectronics sector.Thesamefactorswhichmakeeven mass\\xad\\nproduction garment assembly moredifficult toautomate than\\nassembly inotherindustries (theneed to engineer flexible,\\nstretchable two-dimensional fabric into a three-dimensional shape)\\ngives the actualjobcontentofproduction work more ofacraft\\ncharacter . TheNEDOReviewcomments that\\'theindustry has the\\nproblems ofacraftindustry without thecompensating benefit\\nwhichothercraftindustries such as ship-building andhouse\\xad\\nbuilding enjoy,ofproducing ahigh-cost article\\'(NEDO, 1974a,\\np. 47). It would seem, too, thateven these higherpercentages of\\nofficially skilled workers are anunderestimate ofrealjobcontent.\\nFortheclothing industry provides agoodexampleofthecultural\\nandideological natureoftheskillcategories themselves .Phillips\\nandTaylor(1980),analysing astudyoftheclothing industry by\\nBirnbaum (undated), show how the classification ofjobsvaries,not\\naccording tojobcontent, but with the sex oftheworker.Thereisan\\nidentification ofmen with skilled and women with semi-skilled or\\nunskilled status,and this in turnhas been generated through the\\nstruggles of men workers to retain their dominance within the\\nsexualhierarchy outsidework.Throughout thetwentieth century,\\nmachining in theclothing tradehas been donebybothmen and\\nwomen, but where it was done by men it was classified as skilled;\\nwhere it was doneby women it was classified as semi-skilled.\\nSupposed non-comparabilities between men\\'sandwomen\\'s work\\nwere used to justifythisdistinction - the women workedin larger\\nworkshops, in a more subdivided labourprocess, machining men\\'s\\ngarments, while the men worked insmaller shopsmachining\\nwomen\\'s garments . Thisdiscrimination has survived a whole series\\nofredefinitions ofthe basis for skill classification -whatever\\ndefinition wasadopted, differences werealwaysfoundand 162SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nemployed in such a way as to ensure skilled statusfor the men and\\nsemi-skilled for the women (Phillips and Taylor, 1980, p. 85). These\\ndistinctions cannotberationalised in terms of the contentofthe\\nwork.Birnbaum arguesinsteadthattheyaroseoutofthe \\'struggle\\nofmenworkers from the Russian, JewishandPolishcommunities\\ntoretaintheir social statuswithin the family, even when excluded\\nbytheirposition asimmigrants from the \"skilled\" jobstheymight\\notherwise have done. Forcedas they were to takeonmachining\\nworkusuallydonebywomenassemi-skilled, theyfoughtto\\npreserve theirmasculin ity byre-defining (their)machining as\\nskilledlabour.Withintheclothing tradeheconcludes \"theonly\\nway to become skilled was to changeone\\'ssex\" (Phillips and\\nTaylor, 1980, p. 85).\\nIn theclothing industry, then, there is not thatdevelopment of\\ntechnology andthatacutedichotomisation offunctions which so\\ncharacterises majorfirms in electronics . And this conditions a\\ndifferent geographical form. In the clothing industry there are\\nneitherthehigh-status echelons ofRand0northegrindingly\\ndeskilled jobsofsimple assembly. At the assembly end of the two\\nindustries it is the fact thatthejobsaredoneby women ratherthan\\nthe realcontentofthe work which reduces them bothto the same\\nsocialstatus. At the otherend the clothing industry has no real\\nequivalent to thescientists andtechnologists ofelectronics. The\\ncombination ofindustrial characteristics anddifferent waysofusing\\nspace,different spatialstructures, leads to contrasting formsof\\ngeographical variation .\\n** *\\nThereare also indications ofotherspatialstructures within the\\nclothing industry.Firstofall, there are cases where different plants\\ndoperform different roles in a technical divisionoflabour- where\\nthere is, in otherwords, a part-process structure . In the simplest\\ncase, each ofthepart-process plantsperforms different stages in the\\noverallassembly oftheproduct, butnonethe less has very similar\\nemployment structures . In this case, the fact thatthetechnical\\ndivisionoflabourhas thisspatialform does not show up in social\\ndifferences between different regions.Itdoes,however, have effects\\nonintraregional linkages andinterregional relations, forjustas in\\ntheelectronics hierarchy theseplantsreceivetheircomponents (in\\nthis case half-finished garments) from,andsendtheirproduct to,\\notherplantswithin the same company. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 163\\nInsomeinstances ,however, theseinterplant relations are\\nassociated with social differences in employment structure. This is\\nmainly the case where cutting,performed by men, remains in the\\n\\'central\\' regions and assembly, performed by women, is decentra\\xad\\nlised. Evidence of this spatialstructure exists in bothfootwear (see\\nChapter3;also Massey and Meegan, 1982)and in clothing(NEDO,\\n1974a), but it is difficult to know, withoutmoredetailed enquiry,\\nhow general it is.12Therationale for such a structure is, however,\\nclear.Itwas the cheap femalelabourwhich was the attraction of\\nperipheral regions; indeed, boththeEconomists Advisory Group\\n(undated) andNEDO(1974a) argue thatmaleworkers are not\\navailable in these regions. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, given\\nthe high and rising rate ofmaleunemployment in theDevelopment\\nAreas.Whattheindustries were looking for, however, were men\\nalreadyskilled as cuttersand willing to work for an industry-wage\\nwhich fell between 1950 and 1980 from 110 per cent of the male\\naverage weekly earnings inmanufacturing toaround75 per cent\\n(Department ofEmployment Gazette;Department ofEmployment,\\nNewEarnings Survey). Therewas,moreover, a wayofdealingwith\\ntheproblemofmalelaboursupply which was not available in the\\nfemale-dominated machining process. Forcuttingis more easily\\nautomatable and it seems likely that,for the larger firms which\\ncouldestablish multi-plant structures, ashortage offemalelabour\\nmay have been solved by geographical shift and a shortage of male\\nlabourbyautomation .Itis aninteresting issue which merits further\\nresearch, for it is another casewhereuneven advances in\\ntechnology , long-established andideologically-embedded tradi\\xad\\ntions of who does what job, andchanging locational surfaces (in\\nthis case changing patternsofwage levels)are all involved together\\ninproducing \\'the regional geography ofemployment\\' .\\nThe same process has been going on in the shoe industry, both\\nbetween regions and between towns and adjacent rural areas. And it\\nhas not been confined to very large companies. In theNorwich area,\\ncompetition from the service sector for female labourhaspushed\\ngrowing firms to look outsidethe town for small pocketsoflabour\\n(Moseley and Sant,1977,p. 70). In the east midlands newlocations\\n\\'in rural centres where the local communities haveprovided a small\\nbut useful labourpoolofmarried women\\' have been soughtout\\n(Mounfield, Unwin and Guy, 1982,p. 125). Labourhasnotbeen the\\nonlyfactor, but it has been critical. \\'Market towns and villages,\\nwithoutanysubstantial industrial development ortradition ofshoe- 164SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nmaking,have been chosenin many cases: Corby,dominated bymale\\xad\\nemploying ironandsteel, has provedagoodcentre,too\\'(Mounfield,\\nUnwinandGuy,1982, p. 125).\\nFinally,there is evidence ofanothersetofinterregional relations,\\nthis time at interfirm level between small andlargecompanies. This\\nis the much discussed issue ofsubcontracting. Therearecertainly\\nexamples ,thoughagainhowsignificant it isdifficult to say,of\\nplantsinperipheral regions being tied intosuch astructure . In the\\nNorthEastmanyofthesmallerfirms,particularly in theurban\\nbackstreetsofNewcastle , aredirectlysubordinate tonational retail\\ncompanies (Benwell COP, 1978b). This, again,hasparticular effects\\noninterregional differences . While legally such plantsare locally\\xad\\nowned, the real relations ofcontrollie with a largercompany\\nelsewhere. Such small firms are different from those discussed\\nearlier.Intermsofthe real relations ofproduction andthe\\ndynamic ofaccumulation they are inextricably tied in to the\\nlarge-capital partoftheindustry. In such cases, these apparently\\nindependent plantswill suffer from the vulnerability toexternal\\ndecisions , asopposed simplytodirectmarketforces,usually\\nassociated withclonedbranchplants,andwilldevelop few local\\nlinkages because they are alreadyfirmly tied into a wider structure\\nofproduction .\\nThe impact on national geography\\nAll these spatialstructures inclothing aredifferent bothin their\\nformandin some of theireffects from the spatialorganisation of\\nbig firms in electronics .\\nAt awiderlevel,though, thechanging balance ofspatial\\nstructures in thegarment industry bothreinforces andelaborates\\nthe form ofgeographical differentiation produced by theelectronics\\nandinstruments industries. Mostobviousare thedifferent distribu\\xad\\ntionsofownership andproduction, theformerincreasingly\\nconcentrated in thesouth-east, thelatterincreasingly decentralised\\ntootherregions. As has alreadybeenmentioned , this isprobably\\nlessadvanced inclothing thaninmanyothersectors. Inclothing\\nthereis still a fairly substantial degreeofownership in the\\ntraditional regions. However thefirmswhichdostillhave\\n\\'provincial\\' headquarters are often those with a moretraditional ,\\nlessdynamic structure. Leigh\\'s(1975) evidence on mergers pointsto\\nthis.Threeofthe largest firms in the sectorwereidentified as Some Changing SpatialStructures inthe UK 165\\nhavingtheirheadquarters outsidethesouth-east, butnoneof these\\ntook an active partin theacquisition process he was studying. The\\nregions where there is still a high degree oflocalcontrolinclude\\nYorkshire andHumberside andthenorth-west, together with the\\neastmidlands andEast Anglia. Overall, however, the evolving\\nstructure ofownership in theclothing industry, anditsgeographical\\ndimensions, furthercontribute to theincreasing degreeofexternal\\ncontrolofproduction in thesmallertownsandperipheral regionsof\\nBritain.\\nThese regions, together withsmallertowns in the country as a\\nwhole, have also seen an influx ofclothing jobsforwomen,again\\nmirroring thepatternof bigelectronics firms. The industry is\\nanother majorcontributor to thechanging patterns ofsocial\\norganisation in those partsofthecountry.\\nApartfromexternal controlandapredominantly femalelabour\\nforce, all the spatialstructures ofbig firms withinclothing share\\notherthings with those in electronics .Muchof the early locational\\nstructure of theclothing industry wasrelatedtocomplex patterns of\\nindustrial linkage.Firsttherewerelinkswithothersectors,\\nparticularly with the textile industry. These are now less location\\xad\\nallysignificant. Theotherintersectoral links are with the distribu\\xad\\ntionindustry.Muchoftheoutputoftheclothing industry multiples\\n(i.e.thatpartof thesectorwhich isdominant inthe.decentralisation\\nto theperiphery) isalreadydesignated for specified retail outlets\\nlinked to the firm eitherbyownership or bylong-term contracts .\\nThesecondkindoflinkage - the intrasectoral ones - is typical\\nprimarily ofthesmallercompanies in thefashionendofthesector\\nandagain,therefore, does not applyto thedecentralised production\\nfacilities. Indeed, the \\'very marked negative relationship with\\nexisting clothing employment\\' (Keeble, 1976)mustimply a low\\ndegreeofreliance on local linkage to otherclothing firms. The\\nevidence therefore suggests that, as in the case ofelectronics\\nassembly, these clothing factories willgenerate low local multiplier\\neffects,andhave little economic integration, intheirrecipient\\nregions.\\nLinks between work and community have also changed. As we\\nhave seen, some partsof theindustry, especially footwear, have for\\nlongbeenestablished insmalltownsandruralareas.Here\\nhistorically there has developed aninterpenetration offactoryand\\ncommunity life:\\'Workandnon-work roles and relationships are\\ninterlinked . Theidiosyncrasies oftheindustry are widely under- 166SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nstoodin localcommunities ... workrelationships in thefactories\\nareinfluenced, reciprocally, by thedistinctive valuesofthe ...\\nsmall scale industrial communities in which footwear factories are\\nprincipally located\\' (Goodman, Armstrong, DavisandWagner,\\n1976, p. 59, quotedinMounfield, UnwinandGuy,1982, p. 188).\\nThingsarenotquitethesamearound the new factories in\\nperipheral regions.\\nThechangesinspatialstructure in theclothing industry are also\\nreinforcing theproblems ofthe cities. Jobsare being lost as a result\\nbothofclosures,particularly ofsmall firms and,to some extent,\\ntransfers bylargerfirms. And new jobsandnewinvestment often\\ngo elsewhere. This has not led to significant levels of industry\\xad\\nspecificunemployment in the cities, precisely because there is an\\nalready-established movement ofworkersaway from this sectorand\\ntowards others,butit has been accompanied by aworsening of the\\nworking conditions amongthose left in the industry. So inLondon\\nandthesouth-east, the decline of the better-paid manufacturing\\nsectors,andtheworsening ofconditions inothers,areamongthe\\nfactorscontributing to apolarised socialstructure whichregional\\nper capita andaggregate statistics totallyfail to reflect.\\nInmanyways, then, whatis happening inclothing reinforces the\\npatternofgeographical inequality beingestablished inelectronics ,\\nbut in spite ofthesimilarities there are also majordifferences, which\\nit isequallyimportant to note. Small andlargecapitalinclothing is\\nnot at all the same as small andlargecapitalinelectronics, andthis\\nhasimplications bothsocially and for the structure ofinterregional\\ndifferences .\\nMethodological reflections\\nWhatis going on in clothing andfootwear is notjustachangein a\\ntwo-dimensional geographical patternofemployment but a reflec\\xad\\ntionofthedevelopment ofandchanging balancebetween different\\nwaysofresponding tospatialunevenness; achanging balance\\nbetween different spatialstructures superimposed on each other\\nwithin the employment patternofa single SIC Order.

As well as facing increasing\\nforeigncompetition inproduction, they also suffered from the\\ninternational metropolitan concentration of thegrowing service\\nindustries and their competition forlabour.To hold down labour\\ncosts the largerandmorelocationally-flexible companies soughtout\\nnew reserves, some of which were simultaneously beingaddedto by\\nthefurtherdeclineofthose old basic sectorswhich had once formed\\na key element in a previous international divisionoflabour.\\nTo see thisas aquestion oflocation factorsaloneis to\\nunderestimate bothitsbreadth and itssignificance .Itis also to\\nunderestimate the influence ofgeography itselfas an active element\\nin the process. Differential spatialmobility andabilitytoestablish\\nmultiregional structures ofproduction was animportant partofbig\\ncapital\\'s advantage over small duringthisperiod.Theformer\\'s\\nabilitytoestablish newbranches in new regions can only have\\nfurtherworsened the lot of smallercapital.13Anddifferent spatial\\nstrategies wenthandinhandwithdifferent strategies towards\\nlabour.\\nFurtherissues of explanation and ofmethodology are raised by\\nthecontrasts between large firms in the clothing industry andtheir\\ncounterparts inelectronics. As we have seen, although the socio\\xad\\nlogicalcharacteristics ofwomen\\'s jobsin the two industries are very\\nsimilar, the real jobcontent isratherdifferent. Thishas two\\nimplications. First, it means thatthedecentralisation ofmanufac\\xad\\nturingjobsis not, as often implied, dependent on only one form of\\ntechnological base,butcanoccurwith avarietyofdifferent\\ntechnologies andlabourprocesses. Itis as much dependent on\\nwhodoes ajob(andtherefore thenatureoflabourdemand) as on\\nrealjobcontent. Second,however, what this means in turnisthatin\\neach case a different causalstructure mustbe involved. And indeed\\nthis is so. Large firms in electronics depended for their abilityto\\ndecentralise on achangewithinproduction (including thedevelop\\xad\\nmentofnew,mass-producible commodities) which would free them\\nfromprevious ties to skilled labour.But there has been no such\\nmajorchangeinproduction technology inclothing andfootwear. It\\nhas not been this which has primarily governed itschangein\\nlocation pattern. Inthatsense the clothing industry couldfor\\ncenturies havedecentralised toruralandperipheral regions.\\nAlthough, therefore, it isimportant to know thatit was the 168 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nattraction of cheaper labourwhich induced this geographical shift,\\nit is equally important to know why it happened when it did.\\nIdentification of a location factor in itself cannotanswer this\\nquestion, nor does the explanation lie in a change in labour\\nprocess. As we have seen, the shift has been going on since the\\nSecond World War, thoughvarying over time in its intensity. The\\nquestion is why.\\nIthas been the conjunction of four factors which has been\\nprimarily responsible for this timing. The growth in competition for\\nfemalelabourinurbanareasis along-term factor,though\\nincreasing in intensity after 1960 with the accelerated growth of\\nthe service sector. The emergence of a reserve of female labourin\\ntheindustrial Development Areas is also a long-term phenomenon\\nbut again one which, in the post-war period, accelerated dramati\\xad\\ncally from the early 1960s. The third factor has been the greatly\\nincreased pressure on costs as a result of foreign competition, a\\npressure experienced particularly in the late 1960s and the 1970s.\\nThefourthfactor was the availability of regional policy incentives\\n(andpresumably especially the Regional Employment Premium).\\nTheILAGInquiry(Department ofTradeandIndustry, 1973)\\ncertainly shows regional policy to have been important in the mid\\xad\\n1960s. Such a constellation of factors indicates a very different\\nexplanation ofdecentralisation fromthatwhichobtains for\\nelectronics, and this is true in spite of the fact thatthe\\'location\\nfactors\\' (cheap female labourand regional policy) were the same in\\neach case.To limit industrial location theory to the identification of\\nlocation factors is greatly to reduce its power to explain.\\nMoreover, with reference to the various forms of multiple\\nregression which are so commonly used to string together groups\\nof factors, it must be emphasised thatthe causes which together\\nexplain the decentralisation cannotbe simply added up. They are\\nmutually interdependent andinteracting . Toattemptan assessment\\nof theautonomous influence of one ofthem is therefore to\\nmisunderstand thenatureof the causal structures . Inparticular\\nthe effectiveness of regional policy was both dependent for, and\\nreinforced in, its effectiveness by the existence ofotherconditions.\\nThoseconditions , and the way in which regional policy interacted\\nwith them, were different in different industries. In many parts of\\nelectronics a change in the natureofproduction was necessary for\\nregional policy to be a relevant influence. Forsmall firms in the\\nsameindustry eventhatwas not sufficient if the company was not Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 169\\nlargeenoughto become multilocationaI. In theclothing industry, as\\nwe have seen, the situation wasdifferent again. The question ofthis\\ncomplex role ofregional policy is taken up againinChapter 6.\\nMeanwhile weturnto theexamination ofanothermajorsectorof\\ntheeconomy .\\n4.4Services\\nThe industry: what are \\'services\\' anyway?\\nServiceindustries have been given relatively littleattention in\\nemployment studies. Yet more than halftheeconomically active\\npopulation ofthe UK now works within them. They have also often\\nbeenthought of as subject to different laws from manufacturing\\nindustry, especially in consideration oftheproduction process.\\nIndeed, for long therewas little recognition thattherewasa\\nproduction process in service industries. But events have given the\\nlieto these assumptions .Fromautomation in the office to speed-up\\nin theNational Healthand Social Security services, it has become\\nabundantly clearthatservices are indeed produced andthatthe\\norganisat ionoftheirlabourprocesses issubject to manyofthe same\\npressures andchanges as inmanufacturing industry. And these\\nchanges in theirturnhave begun to have dramatic geographical\\nimplications.\\nServices, however, are clearly not homogeneous. Indeedthey vary\\nalong all the dimensions discussed in Chapter 2. A clear conceptual\\ndistinction can be made between those services immediately geared\\nto thereproduction ofthelabourforce and those for which the\\nmarketisotherbranches ofindustry. The first group,consumer\\nservices, includes most ofthe public services (health,education),\\nmuch of the retail trade,and a vast range ofdirectconsumer\\nservices from hairdressing through cinemas to religious organisa\\xad\\ntions.Producer services, on the otherhand,include business and\\nprofessional functions such asadvertising andmarketresearch, and\\nmuchbanking andinsurance . Clearly, as throughout theindustrial\\nclassification system, few services are entirelyeitherconsumer- or\\nproducer-oriented , but it is possible to make a broadand reason\\xad\\nablyclear-cut division (Marquand, 1979, table 4.9). Thereis also\\nvariation in the natureofownership. Thereare services provided\\nthroughself-employment or by extremely small firms; in contrastan 170SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nincreasing proportion isowned and controlled by medium-scale and\\nlargeprivatecapital; finally, many consumer services in the UK are\\nfinanced and controlled by the State. Justputtingthese divisions\\ntogether withthatbetweenproducer andconsumer services gives a\\nwide range ofcategories. As we shall see, there are still further\\nsubdivisions to be made - variations inlabourprocess also have to\\nbeconsidered. All these dividing lines enable a clearer under\\xad\\nstanding ofthespatialchanges going on, the spatialstrategies\\nadopted indifferent partsof\\'theservicesector\\'.Becauseofour\\ncentralinterest in class and social structure we begin, though, with\\nanexamination ofself-employment and family enterprises, for they\\nare both an important elementofserviceprovision and distinctive\\nin termsoftheir social organisation ofproduction . As we shall see,\\nonce again social change and spatialchange in this partofthe\\nBritish economy are clearly intertwined.\\nSelf-employment andfamilyenterprises\\nIncomparison with many otherWestern European countries, self\\xad\\nemployment and family enterprises are relatively unimportant in the\\nUnitedKingdom, butbothself-employment and very small firms\\n(those with only three or four workers) are more important in the\\nserviceindustries than in any otherpartof the UK economy. Indeed\\nthe service industries broadly definedaccount foroverthree\\xad\\nquarters ofallemployers and self-employed people, most ofthe\\nrest being in agriculture and inconstruction (Marquand, 1979,table\\n1.25).Itisimportant, then, to examine these sectors in orderto\\nunderstand something ofthis aspect ofthe social structure of\\nproduction in theUnitedKingdom.\\nFormostofthe 1960sand 1970s self-employment in the service\\nindustries remained fairly constant atjustover a million people\\n(including here - since the datawill not allow their separation \\xad\\nbothemployers and self-employed). But as a proportion ofself\\xad\\nemployment in theeconomy as a whole thatin services has tended\\nto increase, going from 71.6 per cent in 1961to 78.4 per cent in\\n1975.14Thisaggregate relative healthandstability however,\\nconceals important compositional changes. There has been a shift\\ninsectoral distribution, a shift in the type ofownership and\\norganisation ofproduction and,integral to all this, a shift in\\nspatialdistribution. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 171\\nTable4.1 shows the changeinsectoraldistribution ofemployers\\nandself-employed in services from 1961to 1975. Self-employment\\ninDistributive Tradesfellbothabsolutely andrelatively and\\ncontinued to do so right through the 1970s. Between 1971and\\n1979 the numberofgrocerystoresfell by43000(41 per cent) and\\nmostofthisreduction came from the independent sector,whose\\nmarketsharedeclined from 42.5 to 25.8 (The Financial Times. 21\\nJanuary 1981). In contrast,self-employment in all the otherservice\\nsectorsincreased bothabsolutely andrelatively .\\nYet this is notsimply a shift between sectors.It is not the result\\nof\\'entrepreneurs\\' pullingoutofDistribution andgoingintoother\\npartsofthe social divisionoflabourinresponse todifferences in\\ntherateofprofit.Allself-employed peopleandownersofvery\\nsmall firms, according toWright(seeChapter 2), areeitherpetty\\xad\\nbourgeois (theself-employed) oroccupya classposition somewhere\\nalongthedimension defined between petty-bourgeois andbourgeois\\nclasscharacteristics (theownersofvery small firms). In the context\\noftheUnitedKingdom ,however, thisclassification andcharacter\\xad\\nisationneedsto beelaborated for it misses someimportant\\ndistinctions .Thereare, as we shall see, enormous contrasts within\\nthegroup.Andwhathasactually beengoingon isnotjusta\\nsectoralchangebutachangein theinternalsocialstructure ofthese\\npartsoftheeconomy.\\nSelf-employment in theDistribut iveTradesisprimarily in\\nretailing.

Supermar\\xad\\nkets increased their share of the grocery marketfrom 44.3 per cent\\nin1971to 59.2 per cent in 1979.The advance of the chain-store , the\\nexpansion ofmultiple-outlet retailconcerns, and the growing\\norganisation oftheseindependent enterprises by groupsuppliers\\nand the like, represent not simply the victory of big firms over small\\nbut a change in the dominant form of relations ofproduction and\\ncapitalorganisation; a change in the internal class structure of\\nownership.\\nThe kind ofsmall firms andofself-employment which is\\nexpanding in the service sectoris instarkcontrast. This is\\nparticularly true inInsurance and Banking and Professional and\\nScientific Services (the composition of Miscellaneous Services is\\nmore mixed). Here weare talking aboutaccountants, lawyers, those\\nrunningprivateeducation and medical services, and research and\\ndevelopment agencies.Itisa mixture, in otherwords, of high-status\\nprofessionals\\'< and new entrepreneurial capitalservicing expanding\\nhigh-technology industries. In simple sociological contrast to the\\nshopkeepers of theDistributive Trades,these people, above all, are\\ngraduates .\\n* * *If, then, what looks like simply a sectoral shift is actuallyalso a\\nchange in internal class structure, what does this mean for the\\nchanging patternofgeographical differentiation? First of all the\\nspatialstructure in all these cases of self-employment (and also of\\nthe smallest firms - for which precise regional figures are not\\navailable) is necessarily thatof simple concentration. In all cases\\nthere is, obviously, local control.Geographical differences in self\\xad\\nemployment derive from varying rates of growth and decline and\\nfromcontrasts in social characteristics (status, income, etc.).\\nTable 4.2shows regional variations in self-employment as a propor\\xad\\ntion of total employment in the different branches. The first pointto\\nnote issomewhat parenthetic andconcerns column 1. In East\\nAnglia, the south-west andNorthern Irelandtheproportion of\\nself-employment in all servicesis noticeably (and untypically for the\\ncountryas a whole) lower thantheproportion in the whole regional\\neconomy (column 1 ishigherthancolumn 2).Thisis in all Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 173\\nTABLE4.2Self-employment as apercentage oftotalsectoral\\nemployment. by region. in 19751\\nAll\\nself\\xad\\nemploymentProfessional\\nAll and\\nservices Distribution scientific\\nUnitedKingdom 7.41 8.2 13.57 5.53\\nSouth-east 7.47 7.48 11.47 7.12\\nEast Anglia 9.71 9.02 12.12 5.88\\nSouth-west 10.20 9.36 14.17 5.56\\nEastmidlands 7.14 8.70 16.58 4.67\\nWestmidlands 6.34 8.45 14.23 5.11\\nYorkshire andHumberside 7.05 9.09 15.81 4.25\\nNorth-west 6.86 8.90 15.64 4.82\\nNorth 5.31 6.53 12.20 3.24\\nWales 9.02 9.14 19.51 4.22\\nScotland 5.80 6.48 12.04 4.64\\nNorthern Ireland(1974) 10.48 6.38 14.29 4.26\\nSource: Marquand (1979, table 3.11).\\nprobability dueto the high presence inthoseregionsofself\\xad\\nemployment withinagriculture - theindividual-proprietorship\\nworking-farmer elementofwhatwe have elsewhere termed\\'in\\xad\\ndustrial landownership\\' (Massey and Catalano , 1978). The only\\notherregion which does not follow the national pattern,ofself\\xad\\nemployment beingdominated by the service sector,is thesouth\\xad\\neast,where the proportions areaboutequal.In this case the\\ndifference from the national averageis more likely to be due to a\\nhigher presence of self-employment inmanufacturing, thus con\\xad\\nfirming the analyses bothof small firms in the clothing industry and\\nofthegeography ofentrepreneurship inelectronics .l\"Again,\\nreflecting the historical structure ofmanufacturing andalso the\\ndominance ofprimaryindustries, in this case mining,it isnoticeable\\nthatthenorthandScotland have the lowest overallproportions of\\nself-employment.\\nButwhatinterests us mainly at this pointis theconsiderable\\nvariation between services in different regions. Here it is the\\ncomparison .between Distribution andProfessional and Scientific\\nServices which is important. Lookfirst at the variation in self\\xad\\nemployment inDistribution. Whatthis reflects is primarily the\\ndegree of penetration ofmoreadvanced formsofcapital,a low 174SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\npercentage representing a high level ofpenetration andvice versa.\\nThenorthern region has a long tradition oflargeco-operative s and\\ntheimportance ofsmall,independent tradersiscorrespondingly less\\nthanin regions like the NorthWest and Wales (Bennison and\\nDavies, 1977, p. 9). Overall, the noticeable thing is the lack ofbias\\nofself-employment inDistribution towards thesouth-east of\\nEngland. Indeed, theSouthEast has the lowestproportion of\\nDistribution operated on the basis ofself-employment, anda\\nDevelopment Area (Wales) has the highest. \\'In distribution, self\\xad\\nemployment isremarkably high in Wales, and high in the east\\nmidlands ,indicating the survival oftheindependent andsuggesting\\nrelatively little penetration bynational andlargerlocalshops\\'\\n(Marquand, 1979,para. 3.17).\\nThesituation isprecisely theopposite inProfessional and\\nScientific Services. Here the south-east is faraheadin itspropor\\xad\\ntion ofself-employed, followed by East Anglia. The proportion in\\nthesouth-west isjuston thenational average, and all regions apart\\nfrom these three are below it, with the northhavingaparticularly\\nlow level ofself-employment in these services. Thereis thus a clear\\nlineacrossthecountry, from the Bristol Channel to the Wash,\\nsouthofwhichthereis ahigher-than-national representation,\\nproportionately, ofthesehigh-status ,high-income formsofself\\xad\\nemployment andnorthofwhich the proportion is lower, and\\nconsiderably lower,thanthenational average.\\nIf we now putall thistogether, how do the pattern,andthe\\nchanges in it, relate to the forms of geographical differentiation\\nalreadydescribed ?Thereare twoaspectswhich are important : the\\nsocialstatusof thejobsinvolved, andthe degree oflocalcontrol\\nimplied. The pictureis clear in relationto typeofemployment. Itis\\nthesouthand east of England which has captured the bulk ofthe\\nhigh-status ,graduate-filled type ofself-employment. The shift in the\\nnatureofself-employment in services, therefore, furtherreinforces\\nthedisparities in social composition which are implied by the uses\\nof space in the industries alreadydiscussed.\\nThepatternoflocalcontrol ismorecomplicated . In the\\ndistribution trades, the degree ofself-employment is stillhigherin\\nmanyoftheperipheral regionsthanitis in the southandeast. But\\nit is precisely this form of autonomy which is declining. Again,\\nalthough theamountofself-employment is low in the south-east\\nthis does not mean thatthedistributive tradesinthatregion are\\nexternally-controlled atregional level.Forself-employment in this Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 175\\nbranchis beingreplaced bychain-stores andsupermarkets, etc., the\\nbulkofwhich are multiregional andhavetheirheadquarters in the\\nsouth-east. 17Thisdisparity between regionsisfurtheremphasised\\nby thedominance ofthesouthandeastofEngland in the fast\\xad\\ngrowing partsofself-employment.\\nTherehas,then,been ashiftbothsectoral andsocial in the\\nnatureofself-employment in services, andthis has been integralto\\nitschanging spatialform .Further, theemerging geographical\\npattern, in itsregional variations inoccupational status,ratesof\\ngrowth(intermsofemployment andintermsofaccumulation) and\\nlevelsoflocalcontrol, reinforces manyoftheaspectsofgeogra\\xad\\nphicalinequality whichhavealready beendocumented in the\\nelectronics andclothing industries .\\nOther consumer services: private capital and the State\\nTherestofthe service sectoris bestdealtwith bytaking\\'placein the\\neconomy\\' as the initial criterion ofsub-definition - thedistinction\\nbetween consumer andproducer services. It is this differentiation\\nwhichmostclearlysegments thesector,coinciding bothwith\\ncontrasts in thenatureofownership and,through thevery\\nimmediate relation todifferent markets, withcontrasts in loca\\xad\\ntion. But, as we shall see, thereareimportant subdivisions .\\nTakeconsumer services - thatis,thoseserviceindustries which\\naredirectlyrelatedto the living conditions ofthepopulation. This\\npartoftheeconomic system is controlled andorganised inthree\\ndifferent ways in the UnitedKingdom at themoment. Thesmallest\\npartisthatofself-employment andfamily-ownership , which has\\nalreadybeendealtwith.Second, thereareconsumer services which\\nare runstraightforwardly as a basis for capitalist accumulation \\xad\\nthatis, those in which privateaccumulation isnotincompatible\\nwith the reproduction oftheworkforce to the levels determined by\\nthehistoryofinterclass relations .Third,therearethoseconsumer\\nservices where this politically-arrived-at levelofreproduction is\\nincompatible with the requirements ofprivateaccumulation and\\nwhere services are provided by theState,frequently on anon\\xad\\ncommodity basis. In the UnitedKingdom ,muchofthepublic\\xad\\nsectorprovision ofsuchservices deriveshistorically from the\\nfluctuating consensus ofpost-waryears.\\nFromtheevidence available itwouldseemthatit is only in\\ncertainconsumer servicescontrolled by thepublicsectorthatthe 176SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ngeography ofemployment does not simply reproduce and reinforce\\nthe kindofspatialinequality which results from all the otherspatial\\nstructures examined so far. ISSuchpublicly-provided consumer\\nservices includeeducational andhealthservices and also the\\noperations ofthe local State.\\'\" In terms ofwageearners, there\\xad\\nfore, they are fairly heterogeneous . They include bothhigh-status\\nprofessional employees, such as doctors, groupssuch asteachers,\\nsocialworkersandadministrative workerswhich have over the last\\ntwo decades been undergoing a process of\\'proletarianisation\\' in\\ntermsofworking conditions and social status,andmanualworkers\\nin, forinstance, localgovernment and the health service. All these\\ngroupshave been important components ofthe post-1966 increase\\nintradeunionmembership (NUPE, NALGO, CPSA) and their\\nmilitancy andpolitical stancehaveundergone animportant\\ntransformation over the same period.\\nWhatdistinguishes thegeographical structure of such public\\xad\\nsectorconsumer services from, say, electronics is thatthis wide\\ndiversity ofemployment, in termsofoccupation andstatus,is not\\norganised into such a rigid spatialhierarchy . Indeed, each type of\\nemployment is fairly evenly distributed inrelationtopopulation\\n(Marquand, 1979),certainly incomparison with all the otherparts\\noftheeconomy we have examined so far. Kirwan(1981)shows that\\nthisbroadpictureremained up until 1979, thoughwith a slight\\nweakening in thepositionofsomeoftheDevelopment Areas. In\\npart,of course, this distribution results from the natureofthe\\nserviceitself(it has to be spreadoutfor the services to be\\naccessible). This is not, however, a sufficient explanation . Were\\nthe same services controlled byprivatecapitalit is unlikely that\\nsucharelatively evengeographical distribution wouldhave\\nresulted. This is not to argue thatthere is equal provision of\\npublic-sector consumer services, nor even a truly equal distribution\\nofthe types ofemployment within them. There is not. Thereare\\nmoreNational HealthServicedoctorsper head in the south-east\\nthaninotherpartsof thecountry. But there is an obligation on the\\npublic sector to a minimum levelofprovision regardless ofthe\\nfinancial calculation at eachlocation. This would not be so under\\nprivatecapitalist calculation. Were these sectors organised on the\\nbasisofprivatecapitalist accumulation manypartsofthecountry\\nmight simply go \\'unserved\\'r\\'\\'\\' Therelations ofproduction, there\\xad\\nfore, and the associated natureof the financial calculations made,\\nhave a direct effect on the geographical distribution ofemployment. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 177\\nThatdistribution cannotbeaccounted forpurelyby the\\'technical\\'\\nnatureofthesector.Indeed, theprivatecapitalwhich is operating\\nwithin the same sectors(thatis,privateeducation andprivate\\nmedicine) ismuch more biased in its distribution towards thesouth\\nand east ofEngland.\\nMuch of this relatively even distribution ofemployment inpublic\\nmedicalandeducational services is, in mostlocations, subjectto\\n\\'external control\\' andthelocation of thiscontrol(theadminis\\xad\\ntrativeheadquarters in thecentralState)isoverwhelmingly in the\\nsouth-east. But the meaning of\\'external control\\' andits effects\\ndependupon the real social relations involved. As it is at the\\nmoment therelations ofexternal controlinpublic-sector services\\nare clearly different from those in the privatesector.Thereis no\\nrelation ofaccumulation andso nogeographical patternof\\nappropriation ofprofits.Moreover, whatever therelation of\\nexternal controlas itoperates now within the publicsector,it is\\nopen to reformulation (forinstance in thedirection ofincreasing\\nlocaldemocratic control) through political action.Thisoptionis\\nnotavailable in theprivatesector.\\'Public\\'ownership andcontrolis\\na necessary, thoughclearly not a sufficient, condition for the\\ntransformation ofsuchrelationships .Morewill be said on this\\nlater,butit isperhaps worthpointing outherethatpublic\\nexpenditure cuts not only produce anincrease inunemployment\\nand a decline in services. Nordo they merely represent anattackon\\noneofthefastest-growing partsoftheorganised labourmovement:\\nthey also imply a reduction injobsin oneofthe fewpartsof the\\neconomy where the spatialstructure ofemployment is not massively\\nreinforcing geographical inequality.\"\\n* * *Thoseconsumer services which are produced on the basis ofprivate\\naccumulation can now be dealtwithquickly.Whatisclearisthat,in\\nspiteofhaving a more even distribution than,say,producer services\\n(see later), there are aspectsofunevenness which do characterise\\nthisdistribution andsomeofwhichfollowthelinesalready\\ndescribed .Marquand (1979) is once againaninvaluable sourceof\\ninformation andanalysis. Her studyshowedthat\\'therewasnothing\\nparticularly evenaboutthedistribution ofmanyconsumer services.\\nPublic services on the whole were evenly distributed, butareas\\nvaried widely in their endowment withprivateservices\\' (para. 6.28).\\nMoreover thisinequality was fairly systematic: thereis amarked\\ntendency forcertainmetropolitan areasto be less well endowed 178SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nthanotherswith the whole range ofprivateservices. Finally,most\\nof themetropolitan areas which are \\'grosslydeficient\\' inconsumer\\nservices arein theAssisted Areas(para.8.18).Even at an\\nintraregional level,privateconsumer services are less evenly dis\\xad\\ntributed thanare public, being in general more biased towards\\nlocation in larger centres (Marquand, 1979, table 4.9).\\nPuttingit alltogether, then, in terms of the kind ofjob,andthe\\nlocationofownership andcontrol,privately-run consumer services\\nincreasingly conform to the general patternofdomination and\\nadvantage in thesouth-east ofEngland. Thelong-term growthin\\nimportance ofmultiple-outlet consumer-service companies, and\\ntheirincreasingly interregional scope, has led also to the dom\\xad\\ninanceofthesouth-east as alocation fortheirheadquarters .\\nRelations ofownership andcontrolareincreasingly concentrated\\nthere. Because ofthenatureoftheir services this is a simple cloning\\nbranch-plant structure .Themaindistinctions injobtype are\\ntherefore related to the hierarchy ofownership andsupervision,\\nand once again, thoughin this case there is no great numberof\\n\\'higher-status\\' jobs,the bulk ofthem are in the southand east.\\nProducer services\\nFinally,producer services.The emergence ofproducer services as an\\nimportant andseparately distinguishable partof theeconomy has\\nmanysources.Banking and finance, the City ofLondon, were the\\nprogenitors of British capitalism itself.Themore recent emergence\\nof a wide range of otherproducer services has been closely related\\nto thedevelopment ofboththe technical division oflabourandthat\\nwithin society as a whole. Thereare anumberofratherdifferent\\naspectstoproducer services. Therearethoserelating to such\\nactivities as administration, controlandmarketing, and there are\\nthoserelating more directly to production itself. The growthof\\nserviceoccupations ofthese varied types results from different,\\nthoughrelated,developments . Thegrowthofadministration and\\nassociated functions derives from the increasing concentration of\\ncapital, from the requirements andpossibilities ofmulti-plant\\nlocation, from the increasing emphasis on anddevelopment ofthe\\nmarketing function, theincreasing complexity oflegalrelations, etc.\\nThoseservices more directly related to production, on theother\\nhand,emerge with the increasing technical division oflabour.The Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 179\\ndegreeto which the different kindsofservices aredeveloped\\ndepends, therefore, ondistinctconditions. Thefortunesofbanking\\nandfinancereflect the changing international organisation of\\ncapitalism. Thegrowthofmanagement-related services is especially\\nresponsive to the concentration ofcapital.Research andassociated\\nservices reflect the development oftechnology inparticular direc\\xad\\ntions and the political centrality oftechnology-development itself.\\nThere is also another distinction which can be made within\\nproducer services.Insome cases they are internalised -provided by\\nthe firm which uses them - in othersthey are provided byseparate\\ncompanies .Thisdistinction reflects thedevelopment ofthe\\ntechnical division oflabourgiving rise to a furtherdevelopment\\nofthe social division oflabourwith the creationofnewbranches.\\nWhatwere once functions within the overall plannedrelationsofan\\nindividual firm are now separate commercial entitiesbounded by\\nmarketrelations.

The last\\xad\\nmentioned authorssuggest four main reasonsfor thisconcentration\\nofcorporate research laboratories in thesouth-east.

The first reason relates precisely\\nto theconcentration ofindustries such as electronics, which wehave\\nalreadydiscussed.

The lattersituation isparticularly character isticofthe\\nengineering industries, and it obviously leads to a very different\\nkindofgeographical distribution : \\'Such units tend to be small and\\nscattered throughout theLondonarea, the Midlands and most of\\nthedevelopment regions\\' (Crum and Gudgin, 1978,para. 326).\\nSince most internal research and development isofthis type, it\\nmight indicate a counterbalance to thecentralisation in thesouth\\xad\\neastofthese \\'high-status\\' jobs.\\nBut things are not so simple. The very fact ofgeographical\\nlocation- atproduction sites orseparated from them - is an index,\\nbothofthenatureoftheRandD being undertaken , and of the\\nkindsofemployment involved. The Rand0 atproduction sites is\\nprimarily development work (the \\'0\\'ofR and D), more intimately\\nconnected withproduction itself, less \\'theoretical\\' and less long\\xad\\nterm.Italso involves ratherdifferent kindsofstaff. Scientific and\\ntechnical workers can be subcategorised intoresearch staff,\\nproduction engineers and draughtspeople . It is the first (research\\nstaff) which are most likely to be located away from production at\\ndetached Rand0 sites. The second two are more often located\\nalongside production. Wealreadysawindications ofthisdistinction\\nin the study ofelectronics. The overall result is thatthemajorover\\xad\\nrepresentation ofsuchworkers in theoutermetropolitan area\\naroundLondon, and inotherareas in the south-east andsouth\\xad\\nwest, is in the research occupations - scientists, general engineers\\nandtechnicians .Production engineers and draughtspeople are also\\nmore-than-proportionally presentin these areas, but for them the\\ndeviation is onlyhalfas large. Moreover, severalotherareas,\\noutside thesouth,have high proportions ofdraughtspeople, Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 181\\nparticularly the old shipbuilding andheavyengineering areas\\n(CrumandGudgin, para.85).\\nInotherwords,although areasoutsidethesouthand east are\\nbetterrepresented in these professions as a whole, more detailed\\nanalysis reveals important distinctions. And the social character of\\nthesedistinctions isclearly reflected in geographical differences .The\\nhigher-status jobsarebothmoredistantfromdirectproduction in\\ntermsofthe technical division oflabourandmoredistantfrom it\\ngeographically. They are also morelikely to be in the southern parts\\nofEngland. Thereisagain,inotherwords, a clearandmutually\\xad\\nreinforcing relationship between aspatial andspatialdivisions of\\nlabour. In this case the greater thedegreeofseparation of\\nconception fromexecution, thegreater is likely to be their\\ngeographical separation too.\\nMoreover, this is only research and development withinmanu\\xad\\nfacturing firms and therefore embedded in thedivisionoflabour\\nwithin those firms. The evidence available, however, indicates that\\nresearch and development which is separated offinto adistinct\\nbranchofproduction is evenmoregeographically concentrated,\\nand again into the south-east. ThedatainTable4.3 aretakenfrom\\nthestudyby Buswell and Lewis (1970) andshow clearly boththe\\ngeneralconcentration in thesouth-east andthehigherdegree of\\nthatconcentration in those partsofresearch which are organised\\ninto anindependent branch. These figures are for 1968, butthe\\ncumulative natureof thelocationofresearch meansthatsuch an\\nadvantage, onceattained, will not easily be lost. The difference\\nbetweenindustrial andotherprivatefirms is wide andindicates that\\nthedevelopment of thegeographical distribution ofemployment in\\ntheseactivities maydependinparton thefuturerelationship\\nbetween the developments indifferent aspectsofthe division of\\nlabour.Butwhatever this precise balance, therapidgrowthand\\ngeographical concentration which has so far occurred inresearch\\nforindustry isundoubtedly contributing to thefurtherdominance\\noftheouter-metropolitan south-east ofEngland in thedistribution\\nofhigh-income, high-status jobs.\\nOne reason frequently mentioned for the higher concentration of\\nautonomous research services in the south-east is theirattraction to\\ntheheadquarters ofmajorfirms, for it is through these head\\xad\\nquarters thatresearch contracts are assigned. Thereis thus a link\\nbetween the two typesofproducer services intheirspatial 182SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nTABLE4.3The percentage of UKresearch establishments in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, 1968\\nIndustrial firms\\nOther private firms\\nResearch Associations\\nGovernment and nationalised industries\\nTotal\\nSource: Buswell and Lewis (1970).45.2\\n77.4\\n43.4\\n54.9\\n50.2\\nconcentration . The fact thatdetached company headquarters are\\nalso biased in their location towards thesouth-east, andthatthe\\ndegreeofdetachment and bias increases the larger the company, is\\ntherefore doublyimportant. First, itreproduces the difference in job\\ntypeandin the presence /absence ofcontrolfunctions between the\\nsouth-east and the rest ofthecountry. On this, the evidence on the\\nrelation between managerial location andmanagerial function is\\nimportant. While all managerial andprofessional occupations show\\nsomeconcentration inLondonand thesouth-east, \\'there is a clear\\ngeographical split between controland executive functions. Itis the\\nformerwhich is more often centralised and the lattermore often\\nlocatedatproduction sites. Second, the concentration ofupper\\xad\\necheloncontrolfunctions in thesouth-east furtherencourages the\\nlocation thereofautonomou sproducer services. Thespatial\\nconcentration ofheadquarters ofmajorcorporations isclear\\n(Parsons , 1972;Firn, 1975;Goddard andSmith, 1978) and is\\nincreasing with the increasing centralisation ofcapital(specifically\\ncentralisation hereratherthanconcentration ; it is mergers which\\nappearto be the majormechanism). As Marquand (1979)points\\nout: \\'Theconsequences for the service sectorare serious since\\nbranch plants drawsignificantly feweroftheir services from within\\ntheregionthanlocally-owned plants,withsubsidiaries in an\\nintermediate position.(Thesame is nottrueofpurchases of\\nmaterial input.)\\'(para. 3.61). Crum and Gudgin(1978)summarise\\nwhat they see as the main reason for this spatialconcentration .\\nThey write\\nDetached head offices are locatedin thesouth-east because of:\\n(i) the positive advantages ofagglomeration thataccrue to\\nchairmen [sic]andmanaging directors because ofthe\\npotential for extensive contacts, at aseniorlevel, with SomeChanging SpatialStructures in the UK 183\\npersonnel inothercompanies ,government , finance, and\\nfromabroad\\n(ii) the need of finance directors to benearthe City\\n(iii)internal linkages within firms thatmake it desirable that\\nhead offices shouldinclude a minimum numberofnon\\xad\\nproduction functions thatrequire extensive contacts with the\\nchairman [sic],managing director, and finance director.\\nManyofthesefunctions also derive benefits from the\\npossibility andeaseofcontacts withexpertsin theLondon\\narea\\n(iv) the spanofresponsibility ofsenior personnel dictating that\\nimmediate subordinates shouldbe close at hand, except in\\nsituations suchthatthere is a breakbetween controland\\nexecutive action\\n(v) the superior facilities provided forbothUK and interna\\xad\\ntionalcommunications (CrumandGudgin, 1978,\\npara.392).22\\nThis list of factors also gives some indication ofwhyindependent\\nfirmsproducingadministrative, marketing, legal services, etc., are\\nalsoconcentrated in thesouth-east. Forthisgroup, one can add to\\nthereasonsfor thelocation ofinternal headquarters services the\\nneed tobenearthoseheadquarters themselves .r\\'Once again, the\\nmutually-reproducing natureofthevariouscomponents ofthis\\noverallconcentration is very clear. Once underway,private-market\\nmechanisms areunlikely tostopit.TheSICOrderInsurance\\nBanking andFinanceisnotablyboththeOrdermostclearly falling\\ninto the category ofexternal administrative producer services and\\ntheOrderwhich is most highly concentrated into thesouth-east of\\nEngland (Marquand, 1979, tables 3.1 and3.2).

Increasingly within the larger firms this\\ntechnical division is takingon ageographical form, with the high\\xad\\nstatusjobsremaining inLondonand/orthesouth-east and the more\\nroutinework,providing onlylow-status andlow-income jobs,being\\ndecentralised .Norisit only privatefirms. Anumberofdepartments\\nofcentralgovernment haveadopted asimilarpattern.This is, once\\nagain, aspatialstructure which divides the sexes. It is also a spatial\\nstructure whichincorporates bothahierarchy ofrelations of\\neconomic ownership and possession and a technical hierarchy of\\nproduction. Itistherefore different from the cloningstructure\\nadopted by large clothing firms. But it is also different fromthat\\nin big firms in electronics. Forthis is adifferent technical division of\\nlabour.Herevirtually all theemployees arewhite-collar , non\\xad\\nmanualworkersand the division is a fairly straightforward twofold\\none. The mixtureofmanagers, professionals and scientific workers\\nat the\\'top-end\\' ofthehierarchy is, however, very similar in class\\nlocation tothosein theupperechelons ofthehierarchy in\\nelectronics , and insharpcontrast to theranksofclerical workers.\\nAs would be expected, big companies have a higher tendency to\\ndecentralise . This is in partbecause size makes multiple location\\neasier, and smallerfirms may find the pull ofthesouth-east for the\\ncontrolandprofessional functions andstaffgreaterthan the savings\\nto bemadeelsewhere on the routinejobs.Forinalmostall casesof\\ndecentralisation, whatever the sizeoffirm, a head office is retained\\ninLondon. Inotherwordswhatisoccurring isnotjusta\\ngeographical shiftin an industry butthedevelopment of anew use\\nofspace.Again, while manymoves are only short-distance ones,\\nremaining within the south-east , it is the bigger companies which\\ntend todecentralise theirroutinefunctions over longer distances. In\\ncontrast, the few \\'whole moves\\' which do occur(inotherwords\\nwhere no centraloffice is left in London, and thus no split spatial\\nstructure isestablished) tend to be precisely the shortest-distance\\nones,remaining in the regions aroundLondon (Marquand, 1979,\\npara.5.36).\\nThereasonsfor thisspatialstructure themselves indicatesome of\\nthe effects it is likely to have. Thereare three main groupsof\\nlocation factors involved, andto someextenttheymirrorthose for\\nthetertiary sectorwithinmanufacturing. Firsttherearethe\\nadditional costsofaLondon location,encouraging thedecentrali- Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 185\\nsationofthosefunctions which\\'can\\'bedecentral ised.Theevidence\\nisthatbothrent and wage costs decline with distance fromLondon\\n- for up to about60miles from the city centre. This, then, is a push\\nfactor. But it operates differentially . The second factorhasalready\\nbeenmentioned -thatof the necessity for \\'contact networks\\'. Itis\\noneofthe most accepted axiomsoflocational analysis thathigh\\xad\\nstatuspeople, faced with the long-term orientation decisions (which\\ntheirfunctions at the apex oftherelations ofeconomic ownership\\nand possession imply) require frequent face-to-face contactwith\\nsimilarly high-status people. This, then, is a real \\'linkage\\' reasonfor\\nclustering, asopposed to the social mechanisms discussed in the\\ncontextof research scientists in electronics. But such economic\\nreasonspresumably apply more to the managerial thanto the\\nproduction hierarchy. Thelatter(the high-flying technicians and\\nresearch workers) areperhapsmore able to operatetheirresidential\\npreferences. In their case it wi11be the more social-class andinternal\\nlabour-market aspectsoflocation whichfuel the cumulative\\ncausation . This may also relateto thedifferent intraregional\\ndistributions ofmanagers andscientific staff.Itis themanagers\\nwho tend to be most highly concentrated inconurbations .Within\\nthesouth-east it is the scientific and technical workerswho have the\\ngreatertendency to be in the more ruralstretches of the\\'sunbelt\\'\\nand theoutermetropolitan arearatherthaninLondon itself.\\nThirdly, intheestablishment ofthesespatialstructures thereare\\nthenon-cost aspectsoftheroutineclericalworkers. The LOB case\\nstudy found that\\'almostall firms appeared satisfied with their\\nmoves.Staffmoralewasalmostalwayshigherandabsenteeism\\nlower;productivity had often improved. Few difficulties were found\\ninrecruiting clericallabourlocally\\'(Marquand, 1979,para.5.38).\\nPuttingall these factors together, ofcourse,means precisely that\\nit is the low-status jobswhich are decentralised, precisely those\\npartsoftheoperation whichrequire,andgenerate, few local\\nlinkages and which include few functions ofcontrol.Whatremain\\ninLondonand thesouth-east\" are the high -statusjobswhere wage\\ncost is not the main criterion, the overall controloftherelations of\\nownership , and the contact-generating functions whichbothenable\\nanadvantage, once-gained, to become self-reinforcing andwhich\\ngive to a regional economy precisely thatinternalcoherence which\\nis beingdestroyed inotherregionsofthecountry.Marquand sums\\nup thepotential effects in the areas recipient ofdecentralised office\\nwork:\\'Itisimportant to bear in mind the disadvantages to the 186SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nreceiving community ofrelocating largeblocksofroutineoffice\\nworkthere.

They were\\ndominated by, and oftendeveloped by, thecoal-mining industry.\\nThe decline of Britain\\'s imperial position, and the collapseofthe\\ncoal-exporting industry therefore entailed thebeginning oftheir\\nlong-term economic decline.

Itwas the kindofsituation which\\nFriedman (1977, p. 53) refers to as producing \\'resonance\\' between\\nworkers - abasisforsolidarity .Second,therewererelatively few\\nwithintheindustry in these areaswhocouldnotbedefined as\\nworking class.Thedivisionoflabourwasnotdeveloped sufficiently\\nto form the basis ofanysignificant clementofthosestratawhose\\nfunctions includemiddle-range management , themaintenance of\\ncapitalist discipline andmentalasopposed tomanualwork.\\nMoreover , thisdominance ofa single industry was reinforced in\\nitseffectsby thenatureoftradeunionorganisation withinthat\\nindustry.

Thepotential effectsofsuchcondition sare\\nindicated byLockwood (1958)andSayles (1958), who find that\\nworkerresistance isgreaterincoherent communities dominated by\\nonefactoryor oneindustry. In this case it was both.Indeed, the\\ngrowthofunionisation inminingwasmainlythrough strong\\ndistrictassociations whichwerefrequently jealousoftheirauton\\xad\\nomy(Beacham , 1958, p. 146; FrancisandSmith, 1980).Notonly,\\ntherefore , were these communities highlyproletarianised, butalso\\ntheirpotential fororganisational andpolitical unitywas high.\\nOfcourse,while these conditions maymakeorganising easier,\\ntheydon\\'tguarantee aparticular response.

Coherence ofindustrial structure initselfguarantees\\nnothing.Nevertheless, thesegeographical areasandtheunions\\nassociated withthemhave,bothsymbolically andactually ,\\nthroughout thiscentury beencentresofstrength for the trade\\nunionmovement in theUnitedKingdom . The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 191\\nIthas, however, been an organisational strengthofaparticular\\nkind.Itiseconomically militant. In 1974, ofcourse,it led to the\\nresignation ofthegovernment ; but the record over the longer\\nperiod is equallynotable. Beacham (1958) reckons thatfrom the\\nthirtiesto the fifties miners, a mere 4 per cent oftheeconomically\\nactive,accounted foroveronethirdofthe losses causedby\\nindustrial disputes inGreatBritain.\\' But this is also a unionism\\nwhich is defensive ofstatuswithin the working class, astatusbased\\nnot somuchoncraftskillsandhigherwages, as, say, with\\nengineers, but on closed-shop solidarity and a clear identityof\\njob. TheNational UnionofMineworkers was aleadingunion in\\nthe fight for the closed shop,and was one of the first to win\\nrecognition oftheprinciple fromemployers (Beacham, 1958,\\np. 146).Itis astatuswhich has a basis, too,in pride in the\\nphysical toughness of the work. This is a pride which refers itselfto\\nmasculinity, acharacteristic based not only on the natureofthe\\nwork but also on the complementary lackofpaidemployment for\\nwomen. This, as Beynon (1973) says is \\'thesolid,traditional heart\\nof the British labourmovement\\' (pp.7{}-1)- with all its positive\\ncollectivism, its militantstrength, and its social conservatism.\\nThesecharacteristics werenotsimply a productofwhatmight be\\ncalled\\'purelyeconomic\\', still less \\'locational\\' ,mechanisms . Even\\nthesingle-industry natureoftheseareas,andconsequently their\\nrelative coherence , was also the result ofsocialandpolitical\\nprocesses. First, the lack of paid work for women. All these areas\\nhad,andinvaryingdegrees still have, very low female activityrates\\n(with the exception ofthe large towns andtheconurbations, which\\nare, in any case, offthecoalfields) . In the colliery towns the rate\\nwassometimes extremely low. The increase in paid employment for\\nwomen began in the Second WorldWar,buteven in the mid-1960s\\nin some towns it was as low as 20 to 25 per cent (Department of\\nEmployment andProductivity, 1970).Thisseemsmorethan\\nanything to have been a result ofthenatureofthe work doneby\\nthe men (in particular the fact thatitdemanded largeinputsof\\ndomestic labour, and the fact thatit wasoftenshift-work) andof\\ntheprimacy accorded tothatwork. As H umphrys (1972)points\\nout,women\\'s \\'placewas clearly seen as being in the home looking\\nafterthebreadwinner\\' (p. 30). Secondly, there seems in a numberof\\ncases to have been an active policy ofkeeping outalternative\\nemployment for men. The dominance ofthese local labourmarkets\\nby single industries was not simply a result oflocation factors.The 192SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nNational CoalBoard,forinstance, seems to have guarded rather\\njealously themonopoly ofthe male labourforce which it held in the\\nnorth-east (Hudson, 1982).Thirdly, very little competition for this\\nlabourwasgenerated locally by the rise ofindigenous firms. This,\\nagain,is acharacteristic which these oldercoalfields ,ofsouth\\nWales,ofthenorth-cast ofEngland and ofScotland, have in\\ncommon.Itis also, as we shall see, in partaproductof the class\\nstructure associated with the dominant industries .\\nIn all these ways, then, in the lack ofjobopportunities for\\nwomen, in the lack ofalternative jobsfor men, in the lack ofa\\nlocally-owned \\'small-firm-sector\\', the coal industry (and in the\\nbroader regionsotherindustries such as steel) determined the\\nconditions of existence ofother(actualorpotential) partsofthe\\nlocaleconomy. And those conditions weredetermined bymechan\\xad\\nismsbotheconomic andextra-economic .Therewereothereffects,\\ntoo; on the potential (or lack of it) for local financing (Humphrys,\\n1972), on the establishment only ofsectorsvery directly relatedto\\nthe main industries, and even on the spatialstructure , which itself\\nwas aconstraint onincoming capital(theexport-orientated north\\xad\\nsouthcommunications systemofthe Welsh valleys is a very good\\nexample) .Itis in this sense, ratherthanjustnumerically ,thatthe\\ncoalindustry hasdominated theemployment structure ofthese\\nareas.\\n* * *Compared with the overwhelming preponderance oftheworking\\nclass,otherclasses have been much less important. Therehas been,\\nhowever, quiteasignificant and fairly long-tasting traditional petty\\nbourgeoisie . Such a class seems to have existed in all the older\\ncoalfields but it was particularly strongin the Welsh valleys. The\\nexistence ofa largenumberofsmallish, relatively isolatedcommu\\xad\\nnities,together with the influence ofthephysical structure on\\ncommunications, encouraged a relatively high level oflocal, and\\nlocally-owned, services (H umphrys, 1972, p. 28). Sometimes the\\nunionitself would be involved in runninglocalcommunity services,\\nparticularly in welfare, education andrecreation (Department of\\nEmployment andProductivity, 1970;FrancisandSmith,1980), but\\nthere was also a significant degreeofprivatelocalownership. The\\nextent to which this traditional pettybourgeoisie has hung on varies\\nconsiderably between areas, but the structure ofsmallcommunities\\nhasagainincreased its longevity. Segal (1979, p. 214) pointstoboth\\nthesmallness ofthelocalpopulation basesandthelimited TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 193\\npurchasing powerandrange of demand asdiscouraging not only\\nthedevelopment of localconsumer-goods production butalso the\\nentryoffully-capitalist retailing chain-stores andthe like.\\nIncontrast to this presence ofthetraditional pettybourgeoisie,\\nthere has been a very low level ofdevelopment bothofa newpetty\\nbourgeoisie andofsmallentrepreneurial capital.As we have seen,\\nthe lack of the formerisinpartdue to the absenceofanysignificant\\nmanagerial hierarchy orindependent technical functions within the\\ndominant industries. The lack ofanyimportant development of\\nsmallcapitalseems to be related to a whole complex ofcauses.\\nCertainly, cultural factors haveplayedsomepart,but,as\\nHumphrys pointsout, it \\'seems reasonable tospeculate\\' thatthe\\nsupplyofinvestment fundsandentrepreneurial talentwithin the\\nregion has also been largely affected by the natureandorganisation\\nof thedominant industries (p. 31). The dominant industries in this\\ncase include not only coal-mining but also metal manufacture . The\\nsamearguments apply to heavy engineering, moreimportant in the\\nnorth-east ofEngland. The influence oftheseindustries (oractually\\nof their social organisation) has varied bothbetween regions and\\nover time. In southWales, the semi-colonial natureofmuchofthe\\nearlydevelopment ofcapitalism had its effect. In the early days, the\\nsiphoning-off ofthe available investment fundsandthedomination\\nof much of the development by English capital(Lovering , 1979)\\nwereofparticular importance. And the characteristics ofthe\\nindustries themselves have not been conducive to the formation\\nof suchstrata. Both the occupational structure andthe large size of\\nindividual works,together with the fact thatsingleworksoften\\ndominated wholelabourmarkets (Gudgin, Brunskill andFother\\xad\\ngill, 1979) have in this sense been negative influences. These latter\\ninfluences have also been important in theothercoalfields . Segal\\n(1979)provides adetailedanalysisofthecharacteristics ofthepast\\nindustrial structure which have contributed to thisaspectofclass\\nformation insouthWales, west centralScotland andthenorth-east\\nofEngland. Hesummarises themunderthreeheads: thenatureof\\nthetraditional products andtheassociated labourprocesses, the\\nnatureof theindividual companies engaged in theproduction of\\nthesecommodities, andthegeographical settlement patternwhich\\nwasassociated with the industries (pp.214-15).\\nFinally, innoneof these coalfield areas,norin their wider\\nregions, is there now a local capitalist classofmuchsignificance\\nin terms ofcommitment toindustrial production within the areas. 194 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAgain, the picturevaries a bit from region to region. In south\\nWales, this characteristic is more accentuated thanin theother\\ncoalfield areas,certainly inpartas a result, once again, ofEnglish\\ndomination. This was particularly true of the metal industries ; the\\ncoalindustry itself had a greaterpresenceofWelshcapital, and its\\nstructure seems to have had much in common withthatelsewhere\\n(Carney, LewisandHudson, 1977).Thedeclineofthecoal\\nindustry, however, changed the \\'regional\\' natureofthatcapital.\\nIn coalproduction privatecapitalwas replaced by Stateownership,\\nenabling the former to continue toaccumulate byfurtherdiversify\\xad\\ning itsinvestment, bothoutsidethesectorandoutsidethe region. In\\nsouthWales indeed what was once big capitalseems to have\\nabdicated anyconnection with the region even more than has\\nbeen the case in the othercoalfield areas. In the north-east of\\nEngland, withoutacolonial aspect to its development and with a\\ngreaterpresence of engineering in the wider region, there was a\\ngreaterinitial presence ofa genuine local ruling class. But here, too,\\nthere has been a long process ofdiversification, outofthe initial\\nsectorson their decline (and not only with nationalisation), and out\\nofthe region (see Benwell Community Project, 1978a). Itnow\\nretainsneitherthecoherence ofitsformerhegemonic role within the\\nregion (and the real strength ofthatformerrole is well documented\\nby Benwell COP)nor the high level ofcommitment ofits own\\ninvestment resources to thatregion. The pointisthatthese regions\\ntend to have a capitalist class which is reg ionallymuch less\\ndistinctive thanis theirworking class.Fortheworking class this\\ndifferentiation isbotha source ofstrength (in terms ofregional\\ncoherence) andapotential sourceofweakness (intermsof\\ninsularity , for example). Capital- at least, large and medium\\ncapital- has achieved a far greaterdegreeofsupraregionality. it\\nwould be wrong to supposethatthere isnothing\\'local\\'at allabout\\ncapitalin these areas, as the Benwell Community Projectpamphlet\\nThe Making ofa Ruling Class pointsout for the north-east of\\nEngland,butin purely economic terms it is now increasingly\\nmerged into international capital.\\n* * *All these characteristics have in turnformed one basis for the\\ndevelopment ofothers:electoral domination by theLabourParty,\\nalabourmovement whosedemands focus on Stateintervention ,\\nand a politics ofregional consensus.

A The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 195\\nnumberofthe\\'variables\\' which, in the past, have been said to\\nproduce aLabourvote come together here: the traditional indus\\xad\\ntrialoccupation, theself-contained communities , theintergenera\\xad\\ntional similarity ofwork, the high level ofunionisation (Blondel,\\n1977, p. 64). The NUMhas amajorrole in the LabourParty. In\\n1970it was only the eighth biggest unionin thecountry, but it still\\nhad as many candidates and MPs as the engineers\\' union, the\\nAUEW, which was four times larger. The fact ofgeographical\\nconcentration hascertainly beenpartoftheexplanation for this\\ncontinuing influence (Blondel, 1977, p. 210).\\nThedominance oftheLabourPartyin these mining areas has\\nbeenassociated with aparticular kindofold-style Labour(and\\nlabour-movement) politics - a politics very much based around\\ndemands forStateintervention andStatecontrol.Coal,and indeed\\nmostofthemajorindustries ofthe wider regions, have, on their\\ndecline, been brought underStateownership.

In\\nthis way Tyneside\\'s old ruling class has been able to implantwithin\\nofficialthinking its owndefinition oftheproblems affecting the\\nregion, and advocate solutions thatbest suit its own material\\ninterests\\' (Benwell COP,1978a, p. 63).\\nThus,the leaders of local industry, even if retiredfrom their\\nownership oftheregion\\'s majorsectors, retained animportant 196 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\npolitical influence .Moreover, this local hegemon ic role was\\nfrequently endorsed by at least the leadership ofthetradeunions\\nin the region. Whatwas effectively constructed was a politics of\\nconsensus about\\'theneedsofthenorth-east\\' . And such a consensus\\nwas necessary if a policy in many ways determined bylocally-based\\ncapitalwas to be implemented by local authorities which were\\nfirmly in the handsoftheLabour Party(Carney, Lewis and\\nHudson, 1977, p. 65). In Wales, a not-dissimilar consensus has\\nbeenconstructed (Rees and Lambert, 1979). Here, however, the\\nnotionof\\'the region\\' as a simple and non-contradictory entityis\\nbased more on nationalism thanon the presence ofa locally\\xad\\nhegemonic ruling class. In considering the 1967 WhitePaper,\\nWales: the Way Ahead, thenearestthingthatWales has to a\\nnational plan, Rees and Lambert suggestthatit isa clear expression\\nofthe\\'regionalist consensus\\' which had developed by the early\\n1960saboutthenatureofthe Welsh regional problem, the goals of\\nWelsheconomic development , and the means for their achievement:\\n\\'Itis a\"consensus\" inthatit cuts across the divisions of Welsh\\nsociety,embodying bothorganised labourandcapital,and the\\npolitical parties\\' (p. 10).The numerical dominance ofone class has\\nbeen an important basis for this. Cooke(1981b) talks of\\'the\\nmystical image of a classless society which has traditionally served a\\nvariety of political interests so well\\' (p. I). And the contentofthe\\npolicies focused on good old-fashioned Stateintervention :\\'The\\n\"consensus\" clearlyheldthatStateintervention in the form\\noutlined inWales: the Way AheadcouldsolveSouthWales\\'\\nremaining problems\\' (Rees and Lambert, 1979, p. 14).\\nThe impact, or \\'the combination oflayers\\'\\nItwas into this contextthatcame the female-employing , low wage\\nbranchplantsdiscussed in Chapter 4.Itwas not a new phenomen\\xad\\non.Women\\'s employment in these areas has been increasing since\\nthe Second WorldWar(which seemed to provide the necessary\\neconomic stimulus and ideological rationale to begin the process of\\nraising the traditionally low female activity rates), and coal-mining\\nhas been declining, in employment terms, for much of this century.\\nBut the process has accelerated , and with it the starkness ofits\\nimpact, to reach a peak between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s.4\\nNeitherare these the only new sources ofjobsin these regions;\\nChapter4,afterall,lookedonly at a few sectors.

The increasing\\nparticipation ofwomen in the wage labourforce was not the only\\nthing going on. Socially, however, it was ofcrucialimportance .\\nSowhathave been the effects on the social structure ofthese\\nareasofthecombination ofthecontinuing declineofthe old use of\\nspace with the increasing importance oftheirinsertion into a new\\nspatialdivisionoflabour?\\n* * *First,this shift in economic role and structure has not had negative\\neffects on, norbeenopposed by, the remains ofregionally-owned\\nmediumand large capital.Indeed,as we have seen, such capitalhas\\nbeenimportant informingthe plans and policies which enabledthe\\nentryofthe new forms ofproduction , and it has participated in, and\\nto some extent benefited from, the process by its involvement in the\\nfinancial andproperty sectors. Benwell Community Project(I978a)\\ndocuments the roleofthe old local bourgeoisie inbuilding societies,\\nand land and property dealinganddevelopment in thenorth-east.\\nSo theprevious strategyofdiversification hasenabledcapitalnot\\nonly not to be harmedtoo much by the decline oftheindustries in\\nwhich it was originally involved but also (to the extentthatit has\\nnotabdicated altogether - as insouthWales) to benefit from the\\nnext role to be played by \\'its region\\'in thenational andinterna\\xad\\ntionaldivision of labour.Moreover, to theextentthatthiscapitalis\\nstill involved in industrial production within the wider regions it is\\nmore aquestion of its participating in the process of multinationa\\xad\\nlisationthanof being harmedby theentryof new, much larger,\\ncapitals. The kind oflabourwhich it requires, still being largely\\nmale, isnotsuddenly boostedin itsbargaining powerbyincreasing\\ndemand. Theincoming multinationals seek a higher proportion of\\nfemalelabour,while the bargaining powerofthe men is kept slack\\nby thecontinuing redundancies from the basic industries .More\\xad\\nover, to the extent thatthiscapitalhad formed itself into a local\\n\\'establishment\\', it has not been unseated from this position either.\\nInall these regions the professional andinstitutional infrastructure\\nand theprominent positions in political and civic affairs, although\\nby nomeanssodominated as in the pastby the\\'leadersoflocal\\nindustry\\' (Benwell COP,1978a) have certainly not been takenover\\nby the new managerial personnel oftheincoming sectors.\\nThis lack ofattachment to the region on the partofthe new\\nmanagement strata(andconsequently the lack of challenge to the TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 199\\noldhegemony) isrelatedonceagainto theorganisation of\\nproduction - to the satelliteandproduction-only statusofmuch\\nof theincoming industry (they don\\'t need the local university), the\\nassociated lack ofseniormanagement, to the fact thatindividual\\nmanagers see thejob-andthus the region - as only one step in a\\ncareerstructure, andto thegreaterdiversity oftheincoming new\\nindustries (Segal, 1979,pp. 217 -8). So, while it is certainly truethat\\nthe whole notionof a local establishment beingdominated by\\nanything called\\'regional capital\\'is on the wane, to the extentthat\\nsuch aphenomenon doescontinue to exist it is still firmly in the\\nhandsofthecapitalbased in the previous spatialdivision of labour.\\n* * *Incontrast, whatremainsofthetraditional pettybourgeoisie has\\nsuffered a decline, in particular aslocally-owned shopsarepushed\\nout of the marketby bigretailing firms. This, ofcourse,is not a new\\nprocess, and it isone which isat different stages in different regions.\\nInsouthWales,Humphrys (1972) identifies the 1960sas the decade\\nwhen the invasion reallytookoff(p. 56). In so far, then, as the old\\npettybourgeoisie can nolongerreproduce itself as a class andin so\\nfar as it is being replaced by the wage labourofchain-stores, there is\\na process of proletarianisation going on. But this is not an aspectof\\nchangeof which too much shouldbe made; it is extremely small in\\nscale.\\nThe effects on othernon-working-class stratahave, however,\\nbeenconsiderable. Theincoming industries exhibita more ad\\xad\\nvanced division of labourin the sense of the separation ofcontrol\\nfromproduction . They have longerhierarchies ofadministration\\nandcontrol;topmanagers can bedistinguished from a whole series\\nofmiddleranks.It is,however, mainly middleand lower manage\\xad\\nment which is based in these areas. Thecombination ofthis\\nincreasing separation offunctions with the growing centralisation\\nofcapitalmeans, as we have seen, thatmoreandmoreregions are\\nsubject to externalcontroland the coalfield areasare noexception.\\nThecombination of their pre-existing economic peripherality and\\ntheir lack ofattractions eitherenvironmental orcultural- forupper\\nmanagement - means thatthefunctions ofrealeconomic controlof\\nthe means ofproduction, andsomeofthoseofpossession, are\\ncarriedon elsewhere. This is true ofall theincoming sectorsinthat\\nthey are all largely subject to \\'external control\\'.Further, in those\\nindustries where there is also a production hierarchy, it is themore\\n\\'professional\\' functions ,thosewithhigherstatusandgreater 200SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nindividual jobcontrol,which can be, and are, centralised away from\\nthese regions. In terms ofWright\\'s analysis these people would\\nprecisely fall into the category ofsemi-autonomous employees,\\noccupying acontradictory location between proletariat and petty\\nbourgeoisie. The upperechelonsofthemanagerial hierarchy on the\\notherhandoccupy a contradictory locationbetweenproletariat and\\nbourgeoisie, thoughwith a far greateraffinity to the latterthan to\\nthe former. The development ofthe division oflabour, which means\\nthatthesefunctions come to be performed byseparate groupsof\\npeople with identifiable social-class characteristics, has enabled also\\nthegeographical separation, and removal, oftheelements of\\nconception andcontrol.\\nThefunctions oflow-level technocrats and low and middle\\nmanagement have, however, tended to locate within these regions\\nof direct production . To a large extent this geographical locationis\\nnecessitated by the natureoftheirfunctional relationto the process\\nofproduction. Whatit isimportant to note here, however, is that\\nthe very fact oftheseparation-out ofthese functions through the\\ndeveloping division oflabourhascontributed to ablurringofthe\\nformerstarkness ofthecapital-labour confrontation in these\\nregions. Thus, there has been a growthin these regions ofmiddle\\nmanagement andtechnocratic stratathroughthe very emergence of\\nseparate functions.\\nHere the question of\\'regionalisation \\' comes in. These middle\\nmanagers andtechnocrats are less likely to live on the coalfield\\nitself.Spatialreorganisation within these areas, and their integra\\xad\\ntion with the wider region, is partand parcel of social reorganisa\\xad\\ntion. InrelationtosouthWales, Rees and Lambert (1979) write:\\n\\'Thedivision and polarisation between the valley communities and\\notherpartsofSouthWales have a clear class dimension . Hence, it is\\narguable thatthe changes thathavetakenplace in the natureofthe\\neconomy in SouthWales and the consequent shifts in population\\nhave resulted in what may be termed the \"embourgeoisement\" of\\nthesettlements ofthecoastalplain. It is here thatthosepartsofthe\\nStateadministration which have been moved from London are\\nlocated; it is here thatthe many immigrants ofmanagerial and\\nexecutive level who have come with UK or multinational firms to\\nwork for a spell in the region find homes\\'(pp. 33-4). Given the\\nfunctions which they perform, middlemanagement andproduction\\xad\\nbasedtechnicians , unlike top management andstrategicRand0,\\ncannotremove themselves entirely from the region, from the place The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 20I\\nofactualproduction . Butwithinthe region, the separation-out of\\nthese functions has been accompanied bygeographical and social\\nseparation. Therelation between socialdistance fromactual\\nproduction andgeographical distance could not be clearer.\\nTheabsolute increase in the wider region is important to note, for\\nit is often claimed thatone of the main problems ofthe wider\\nregions of which the coalfields are a partis their lack ofwhite\\xad\\ncollar,managerial and technical jobs. As we saw in Chapter 3, this\\nis to miss the point.Whathashappened isthatthepushingforward\\nofthe division oflabourhas both increased the absolute numberof\\nsuchjobsin these regions and at the same time, because of the\\nremovalofthe top-level functions, increased the difference between\\nthese and more centralregions. Similarly, what has actuallybeen\\nlost to these regions is not a type of job(since such jobshardly\\nexisted before) but a function within the overall social relations of\\nproduction .Reconceptualising things in this way also highlights the\\nambiguity ofdemands focusing solely on geographical location\\n(demanding thereturnofownership andcontrolto \\'Wales\\' or \\'the\\nnorth-east\\', etc.), and the politics of regional consensus discussed\\nearlier.Fundamentally, the issue is about,not the geographical\\nlocation of control,but its class location\\'\\nThe newness ofsome aspects of the incoming industries has also\\nbeenexaggerated . Muchofthe political debateaboutthese regions\\nisconcerned with the impact of\\'external control\\', butimportant\\nsegments of production in these areas have been subject to external\\ncontrolfor a long time. In centralScotland, and more particularly\\ninsouthWales, there is the centuries-old factofa semi-colonial\\nrelation with England. This was not the case in the north-east of\\nEngland, and it does seem thatit is in this region thatsomething\\ncalled regional capital,localcontrol, can most clearly and until\\nmost recently be identified. But in none ofthe regions is external\\ncontrolnew. On the coalfields production has for decades been\\nsubject to the external controlofanationalised industry based in\\nLondon. Given the way thatnationalised industries have been\\norganised, the top functions ofownership andmanagement have\\nbeen carried on outside these regions since the end ofthe Second\\nWorld War. Decisions aboutlong-term investment (and disinvest\\xad\\nment), the top levels ofcontrolandsupervision, decisions about\\nwagenegotiations, all haveemanated fromLondon, and it is there\\nthattheassociated socialstratahave tended to be located. The fact\\nof external controlis not new. Whatare new are some ofits 202SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nimplications for regional social composition. The social hierarchy of\\nadministration andcontrolin theincoming industries is more\\ndeveloped andextended, andthedevelopment ofproduction\\nhierarchies, with their associated patternsofsocialdifferentiation,\\nis a recent innovation .Stateownership ofthetraditional industries\\nin the wider regions has been extended to steel and shipbuilding.\\n\\'External control\\'isbothincreasing inimportance andchanging in\\nitsimplications .\\n* * *But theincorporation ofthesepartsof thecountry intodifferent\\nspatialstructures ishavingitsmostimportant effectson the\\nstructure andorganisation, the lives and the politics, ofthe work\\xad\\ning class. In particular , the old form ofcoherence, organisation and\\nstrengthofthis class is being undermined .\\nFirst,the size and structure of the class are undergoing change.\\nMostobviously, over the longer periodthere has been a consider\\xad\\nable decline in the traditional workforce, as a result bothofmassive\\noutmigration andofdeliberate policiesoftransfer, particularly for\\nminers(Department ofEmployment andProductivity , 1970; Rees\\nand Rees, 1981). To the extent thatthismigration was selective it\\nalsoentailedsomechangein thecomposition oftheworking class\\nthatremained . And while this traditional workforce has been\\nshrinking andchanging ,otherfundamental shifts have been under\\nway. Most importantly, capitalist relations ofproduction are being\\ncontinually extended to people who were previously non-wage\\xad\\nearners,and inparticular tomarriedwomen. So the economically\\xad\\nactiveworking class isexpanding in a new direction .Itis also\\nbecoming moreinternally differentiated. Theincreasing employ\\xad\\nmentofwomen isone aspect; the greatervarietyofnewindustries is\\nanother. Therehas also been an expansion ofwagerelations in\\nclerical and service work - in otherwords, into non-manual labour.\\nWhile the overall size oftheeconomically-active working class is\\ngrowing, therefore , itsprevious coherence andhomogeneity are\\nbeingdisrupted.\\nThus,although forcapitalism this hasrepresented expansion, for\\nthe local working class itrepresents a moredramatic change.Not\\nonly are women now increasingly absorbed intocapitalist wage\\nrelations, but with the continued decline of the basic industries,\\noldermen are increasingly excluded from them. Table5.2 shows\\nhowimportant thesechangeswere over the 1960s. Socially, this has\\nproduced disruption and some confusion.

In the valleys ofsouthWales the\\noncecoherent andclosedcommunit iesofthe pits have for long been\\nundergoing a process ofintegration intoadifferent, more compli\\xad\\ncatedandheterogeneous networkofspatialrelations. Muchofthis\\ninternalspatialrestructuring startedwith the decline and reorgani\\xad\\nsationof the old industries ,particularly coalandsteel. In these\\nindustries, attempts to increase productivity have involved both\\nconcentration into larger units and often fairly substantial intrar\\xad\\negional shifts (for instance, in steel,towardsthecoast). Muchofthe\\nNewTownspolicy, an important partofthestrategyofspatial\\nreorganisation, has also been associated with the declineand\\n\\'rationalisation\\' of theolderindustries .\\nThelocation patternoftheincoming industry has also been very\\ndifferent fromthatofthe old. H umphrys (1972)pointsto two main\\nelements in this patterninsouthWales. On the one hand,the large\\nfactories lie isolated on greenfield sites outsidethe towns: spacious,\\nsingle-storey, windowless boxes housing modern flow-line manu- 212SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nfacturing techniques . On the otherhand, thesmallerfactories\\nclustertogether aroundthesharedinfrastructure ofbleaktrading\\nestates.Itis an \\'industrial landscape sharedby many Development\\nAreas.\\nThe most favoured locationofthe newer industries is close to a\\nmotorway. In Wales, by the mid-1970s, 70 per cent ofall the\\noverseas-owned establishments had been set up within ten miles of\\namotorway (Davies and Thomas, 1976, p. 57). Contact with \\'the\\noutsideworld\\'is moreimportant thanlinks within the region.\" It is\\nan evident reflection ofthe growing role of these areas as a place of\\nproduction ofconsumer-related goodsfor the UK and the EC. Many\\nofthe new manufacturing industries produce consumer goods or\\ncomponents ofconsumer goods for mass markets. But lessthan4 per\\ncentofthe total British population lives insouthWales; the major\\nmarketsare in the midlands andsouth-east ofEngland. Inputsand\\ncomponents, too, often come from outsidethe region. The \\'transport\\ndemands ofthe new industrial economy couldhardlybemore\\ndifferent from those the inherited transport network grew up to\\nserve\\'(Humphrys, p. 66). The completion ofthe Severn Bridge \\xad\\ncarrying amotorway - in 1966wassymbolic ofthischanging relation\\nbetween the economies ofthe areas which it linked.\\nIn all this restructuring ofspatialrelations within the region, the\\nState,bothcentralandlocal,playedanimportant role.The\\nindustrial estates(thepublicly-owned ones), the motorways and\\nthe New Townswere allStateorganised and financed - thoughthey\\nprovided privateindustry with some lucrative projects. In amore\\ngeneral way, too, this provision by theStateofthe new, and\\nmassive, conditions ofproduction wasalready(apart,thatis, from\\nregional policyincentives) aconsiderable subsidy toprivate\\nindustry.Hudson (1979) has documented theprocess - the\\nreorganisation ofspatialformthrough theState\\'suseof\\'deva\\xad\\nlorisedcapital\\'- for the case ofWashington New Town in the\\nnorth-east ofEngland. Verysimilarshifts,disruptions and deser\\xad\\ntions(andaccompanying political battles)have also taken place in\\nsouthWales - the move from the valleys to the valley-mouths and\\nthecoastalplain being the most obvious, and at the broadest level,\\nand closely paralleling the west-east shift in the north-east of\\nEngland.Cooke(198Ia)pointsto anincreasing geographical as\\nwell as social polarisation in Wales.\\nApartfromproviding a moreappropriate spatialstructure and\\nnew physical infrastructure, the New Townstrategy has been a TheEffects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 213\\nmeansofreorganising thelabourforce in a way which would meet\\ntherequirements of the new and changing industrial structure.\\nHousing policy can also work to this end. In the north-east, for\\nexample, the distribution ofnew stock - mainly in Washington New\\nTown -particularly affected new households lookingfor a place to\\nlive for the first time, and the patternofin-migration andof\\nDevelopment Corporation lettingscontributed to a bias towards\\nyounger people.

The patterns of newhousingandofjob\\nopportunities may be mutually reinforcing inexcluding older\\nredundant men from further\\'economically-active\\' life.\\nSo thespatialreorganisation of these regionsprovides new\\nconditions foraccumulation notjustin a physical infrastructure\\nsense but also through thepartwhich it plays in social restructur\\xad\\ning.Itis aphenomenon which Rees and Lambert (1979)andRees\\nand Rees (1981)refer to in their discussions ofsouthWales. It is\\nalsopartof thebreakdown ofpreviously-definable subregions and\\nlocalities.\\nForlocalpopulations all this has often meanteitherresidential\\nchangeor having to travel much furtherto work, or both.Manyof\\ntheoldersettlements have become essentially dormitory towns. A\\nneweconomic andsocialsubregionalisation emerges .Froma\\nsituation wheremostpeople lived close to work andeven walked\\nthere, there is now a complex patternofcommuting .

Hudson (1979)\\ndescribes some ofthecomplexities of thecommuting patternwhich\\nhas now evolved. And the situation is similar in otherold coal\\xad\\nfields.The FinancialTimes reported 5000peopletravelling each day\\nintoGlenrothes.

It is\\noverwhelmingly tomanufacturing and service jobs.\\nWith this social diversification andspatialdislocation has come a\\nbreakdown, too, in the old, predictable politics. The long-held\\nhegemony oftheLabour Partymachine and the ideology of\\nlabourism isunderchallenge.\\nIn Wales this began as early as the 1960swith the growthof Plaid\\nCymru. Here \\'devolution\\' and nationalism had been developing as\\nelements oftheregionalist consensus since the 1960s;they were \\'not\\nasuddenphenomenon bornof 1970\\'s crisis\\' (Rees and Lambert,\\n1979, p. 23). And in the ideology ofthatnationalism \\'thevalleys\\'\\nplayed a centralrole:\\'oneofthecentralthemesofthe Public\\nInquiryon theproposed New Town at Llantrisant was the extent to\\nwhich the development woulddestroywhat was assumed to be the\\n\"wayof life\"characteristic of theindustrial valleys.

Cornwall, too, 216SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhas been on the receiving end of the process. And here the social\\nstructure into which the new industries have been implanted could\\nhardlybe more ofacontrast. Insteadofthecombination ofState\\nownership , bigindustry andworking class,Cornwall has much\\nmoresignificant proportions ofsmallindustry andself-employment ,\\nandamuchlowerimportance oflargeindustry andhighly\\xad\\norganised ,relatively well-paid maleworking class. All this, of\\ncourse, in some measure again results from the very different role\\nwhich this partofthecountryhas played so far in the UK economy,\\ninotherwords its previous locationin a wider territorial division of\\nlabour.\\nThe class structure ofCornwall is notdominated by anindustrial\\nproletariat. Insectoral terms, its historically-important industries\\nhave been agriculture, mining and tourism. Only the second of\\nthese,together with some small presence ofshipbuilding and\\nengineering, form a basis for the kindofunionisation which exists\\nin the coalfields, and even then these industries have been on a far\\nsmallerscale.\\nMoreover , whileCornwall is like the old coalfield areas in having\\nhadhistorically a very low female activity rate, the reasons for it\\nhave been very different. TheCornish CountyStructure planners\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b) analyse this in detail and argue\\nthatthemostimportant explanations are: first, a straightforward\\nlackofworkopportunities , second, the availability ofseasonal\\nworkduringthesummer (which they argue is probably afactor\\nreducing the willingness ofmarried women to seek year-round\\nemployment) ,third, the fairly high overall level ofunemployment ,\\nandfourth,thegeographical natureoftheCounty. This last, the\\ndistribution of muchofthepopulation in villages and small towns,\\nisarguedto be \\'perhaps the most important factoraffecting married\\nfemaleactivityrates\\'(p. 99).Itlengthens theaveragejourney to\\nworkand this in turnparticularly affects women as a result ofthe\\nrestricted publictransport facilities and oftheir having lessaccess to\\nthe\\'family\\'car. It is, therefore, often more feasible for women \\'to\\nhelp on the farm, take in summerguests or to be less well offand\\nstayathome\\'(p. 99). Forsimilarreasons thisgeographical\\nstructure reduces not only the numberbut also the range ofjobs\\nwithin easy access. The continuing influence on activityrates of\\ntheseproblems ofaccessibility is confirmed by thevariations within\\nCornwall between urbanandruralareas: \\'Rates were up to 8 -9%\\nlower in ruralareasthanin the towns in 1971\\'. It is a clear example The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 2I7\\nof theinteraction between geographical forms and patriarchical\\nstructures. It is of course probable that,precisely because ofthe\\nhigherproportion thannationally ofsmallcapitaland self-employ\\xad\\nment,particularly inagriculture , more women were involved in\\neconomic productive activity than the statistics show. But this kind\\nof work has been declining dramatically - between 196I and 1971\\nthenumberoffemaleworkers actually registered in agriculture\\ndeclined by 12 per cent (while nationally there was an 1I per cent\\nincrease) (Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b). So the labour-reserve\\nwhich was one oftheattractions toincoming industry was\\n\\'produced\\' by a very different social history from the apparently\\nsimilarlabour-reserve notthatmany miles away in southWales.\\nItwas,moreover, a reserve with different characteristics. A\\nmarried woman in this region was less likely to be \\'just\\'a wife\\nandhousekeeper to a\\'breadwinner \\' and more likely to be involved\\nin some form ofnon-domestic labour; keeping a bed-and-breakfast\\nboarding house, maybe, or doing (paid or unpaid)work on the\\n\\'family\\' farm. In both the coal-fields and Cornwall oneofthe\\nattractions toindustry has been a reserve oflabourwhich - so\\nmanagement hopes - will be relatively cheap, but above all non\\xad\\ncombative. Inboththese areas the reserves are in large measure\\ncomposed ofwomen. But the vast varietyofways in which\\npatriarchy works, and in particular itsgeographical variations,\\nmeansthattheprocesses bywhichsuchcharacteristics are\\nproduced, andtherefore theindicesonwhichthey can be\\nmeasured , also vary widely. While manymarried women in\\nCornwall ~aynot have been confined to the home and to domestic\\nlabour, and may even have appeared inofficialstatistics as\\n\\'economically active\\', they have none the less rarely been working\\nincapitalist wage relations and even more rarely within any labour\\nprocess likely to provide the basis for solidarity andworkplace\\norganisation . In theCornisheconomy, especially thatpartin which\\nwomen were directly involved, a kind ofpetty-bourgeois self\\xad\\nsufficiency and independence had been the orderofthe day. Such\\nsocialcharacteristics are very different from those ofthe coalfields,\\nbut they lead to a crucial similarity - they providewhat seems like\\ninfertilegroundfortradeunionorganisation .\\nCornwall also differs from the old coalfield areasin having been\\nhistorically a low-wage economy. This appearsto be the result of\\nindustrial structure, low relative wages within thatstructure, and\\ntheavailability ofseasonal work. Seasonal work provides extremely 218SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nlow(annual) wages to those who have to relyon it altogether, but it\\ncan also have the effect of subsidising otherwages, so thatpeople\\ncansupplement the income from their regularemployment by\\ntemporary orpart-time jobs. On the otherhand,if the pay from\\ntheir main jobswere higher, the need for this might not arise\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b, p. 40). Such employment may,\\ninotherwords, mean thatwages in othersectors can be held down.\\nDepending on thenumberofpeople who have only seasonal work,\\nit could also produce a divergence between average wages per job\\nand average income per head. Itisparallelto thesubsidisation of\\nwages in capitalist firms by subsistence farming in peasantareas.\"\\nFinally, the structure oftheownership ofproduction isdifferent\\ninCornwall. Neitherlocally-based big capitalnorState-ownership\\nis of much significance. In contrast, smallcapitaland self-employ\\xad\\nment are far more important thanin the coalfields. As a proportion\\nofthepopulation, self-employed peopleare 2.5 timesmore\\nimportant inCornwall thannationally, andCornwall has been\\nand still is much more dependent than the economy as a whole on\\nprofitsfrom such sources and from professional earnings (Cornwall\\nCountyCouncil, I976b, p. 41), much ofitcomingfromagriculture\\nand from tourist-related activities.\\nThe impact, or \\'the combination oflayers\\'\\nUntil the 1950s, the manufacturing basisoftheCornish economy\\nwas in decline, but in the mid-1960s this long-term trendwas\\nreversed and manufacturing firms began moving into the County.\\nThein-migration reached a peak in 1969and 1970, but in the mid\\xad\\n1970s was still well above the figure for the mid-I960s. The new\\nemployment is verysimilartothatarriving over the same periodin\\nthe coalfield areas. Two-thirds ofit is inbranchplants,which in\\nturnare the element most heavily biassed towards female employ\\xad\\nment(about60 per cent). Manyof themanufacturing jobsare in\\ninstrument and electrical engineering, and new jobsin services have\\nalso been important .!\" The largest factories (in employment terms)\\nhave gone to the towns (themselves small), but the biggest impact\\nhas been in rural areas.\\nSo what, then, ofthe effects oftheentryof these new forms of\\nemployment , and how do they compare with the impactin the old\\ncoalfield areas? The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 219\\nDescriptively, someoftheimplications havebeensimilar:the size\\nofthepopulation engaged in wage labourhasincreased, again\\nprimarily becauseoftheincorporation ofmorewomen(almostall\\nofthemmarried women) intotheworkforce, andunemployment in\\nsomeareashasincreased.\\nBut it is the differences which are striking.\\nIn the first place, the implications for theworking classarefar\\nlessdramatic.

First,in terms ofitscurrentemployment of\\nworkers, thisgroupisunimportant incomparison to thebranch\\nplantsestablished by bigger firms (Cornwall County Council,\\n1976b;Perry,1979).Moreover, although thecombination of\\ndeclineofold and influx ofnew has indeed produced achangein\\nthenatureofself-employment andsmallcapital, it isnota\\nstraightforward shift from traditional pettybourgeoisie toprofit\\xad\\nmaximisation andaccumulation . A study ofthe \\'independent small\\xad\\nfirmmanufacturing sector\\' in the countydistinguished between\\ndifferent typesofsmall firm on the basis ofwhetherthey were local\\norimmigrant andwhether they were new or existing companies.\\nWhatisinteresting isthat,although there were certainly contrasts\\ninattitudes togrowth,noneofthegroupsconformed to the classic\\nmodelofcapitalist accumulation .Certainly, thetraditional sector\\ntended to be of the \\'simple-reproduction\\' variety, but the new\\nentrants do not live up to the fashionable imageofthe striving\\nentrepreneur either. Thus\\nDifferences in thegroups\\'attitude towards growthwere\\ndiscovered. Established localentrepreneurs tended to show satisfi\\xad\\ncingratherthanoptimising behaviour and to be people-rather\\nthanprofit-oriented . New local entrepreneurs werecraft-rather\\nthanmarket-oriented. Owner-managers ofincoming complete\\ntransfers,attracted by acombination ofregional aid in a pleasant\\nenvironment, were not strongly growth-oriented, and were the\\ngroupmostconscious ofcapital-transfer problems onretirement.\\nThe new incoming entrepreneurs came closest to the stereotype of\\naprofit-maximising entrepreneur, but even this groupcontained\\nmanyredundant ordisenchanted executives from larger corpora\\xad\\ntions,stronglyattracted toCornwall by theenvironment.\\nThussomething ofasemi-retirement cultureprevailed, but, of\\ncourse, the typical small firm everywhere stays small, and there is\\nnoreasonwhy itshouldexpandjustto suit the wishes ofregional\\nplanners. Boswell\\'s (1972)studies ofsmall firms in the Midlands ,\\n(assumed to be one ofthe more growth-oriented regions) led him\\ntoconclude thatonlyabouthalfofthem were expansion-minded :\\noursurvey would suggest a proportion thatwas a good deal less\\nforCornwall (Perry, 1979, pp. 19-20). TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 221\\nItisworthat leastconsidering whether the very fact ofsuch a\\nresponse to this kind ofenvironmental attraction (asopposed to the\\nmore\\'social\\',andeconomically morecentral,environment ofthe\\n\\'sunbelt\\') on thepartofownersofcapitalmightimply a relative\\nlack ofinterestinprofit-maximisation . InPerry\\'ssurvey,allthe new\\nentrants had first got the idea duringaholidayvisit to the County. I I\\nCertainly , thisgroupis unlikely to become the basis of an extension\\nto a local, truly capitalist , class; still less the basis for locally\\xad\\ncontrolled accumulation . Similarly, the implications ofthis kind\\nofentrantforemployment growthin thefuture, andtherefore a\\nfurtherexpansion oftheworking class, are notmajor.Finally, and\\nfor all the same reasons, it does not providemuch basis for self\\xad\\nreliantregional growth. Indeed, even worse, it was precisely this\\nkindofin-migrant which was mostsubjecttofluctuations in\\nemployment as a result ofchanging macroeconomic conditions\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b). In particular , they were more\\nsubject to decline in the recession of the 1970s thanwerebranch\\nplants.Certainly , astrategybased on these kinds offirms is unlikely\\nto be a viable basis for regional economic resuscitation. V\\n.Thisconsideration ofthenatureofin-migration pointsto\\nanother contrast between the changes going on in Cornwall and\\nthoseunderway in the coalfields. In both, as we have seen, there is\\nagrowthofthe \\'new middle class\\', takenat its widest, but the\\ncomposition of thisexpanding socialstratumisdifferent in the two\\ncases. In particular, too,they are different intheirrelationto the\\nregion. In Cornwall, thegroupconsists importantly ofthe self\\xad\\nemployed andsmallemployers. They are defined in terms of their\\nrelationto theownership of(small-scale) production. Thegrowth\\nofthisgroupinCornwall is,moreover , very much a reflection ofits\\ndesire to be there. It has been attracted by thecharacteristics of the\\nregion itself. The situation in thecoalfields couldhardlybe more\\ndifferent. Here, the dominant elements ofthe new white-collar\\nmiddle class consistofmiddlemanagement in largecorporate and\\nStateorganisations. Veryoftenthey, too, have been drawnin from\\noutside. But in this case it is rarely a voluntary move, rarely a result\\noftheattractions ofthe region; all too oftenthe region is merely a\\ntransient ,andoftenunwanted ,staging-post in a climb up the\\ncorporate hierarchy .\\nBut the main difference in impact between the two regions is that,\\nwhile in the heavy-indu stry areas capitalhas not been adversely\\naffected by the entry of the new industries , inCornwall it seems to 222SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nhave witnessed the process with some horror.The most important\\nboneofcontention concerns competition forlabour,and specifi\\xad\\ncally wages. Cornwall has for a long time been a low-wage area,\\nand theStructure PlanReportsbemoan the fact thatthejobsbeing\\ncreatedthere in the 1960shave done little to change this. One ofthe\\nrecommendations ofthe Plan is to createconditions to make it\\neasierfor women to do paid work.TheCornwall Industrial\\nDevelopment Association is the main, and vocal, representative of\\nlocally-based capital,mostofit small, and including somealready\\xad\\nestablished in-migrants. Its reply is unequivocal. It agrees that\\nwomen have to travel furtherto work than men. This, in CIDA\\'s\\nopinion, \\'seems ...to conflict with the naturalpreference ofthe\\npeople\\'(p. 49).Itagrees with the Council thatthe difficulty women\\nhave in getting to work is unlikely to be overcome \\'unless either\\nearnings increase so thatmore wives can affordtheir own trans\\xad\\nport[!],or public transport services are increased withoutlarge fare\\nrises\\'. This, thunders CIDA,\\'is precisely the kind ofspurious\\n\"growth\" which we seek to avoid. The problem, as we see it, is not\\nto bring in more female-intensive factory jobs; the problem isto\\ntake work to women to carry out at or near home\\' (p. 49). In other\\nwords, the aim should be to open up the labourmarketratherthan\\nadd to the demandforlabourand so push up wages. Whatseems to\\nbe going on here, in otherwords, is a tussle over spatialform, in\\nwhich the ideology ofthe family is invoked, but which is actually\\naboutwho taps a laboursupply and how. Internalspatialstructure\\nisimportant in this conflict. CIDArejects all notionsofgrowth\\npoles, \\'growth triangles\\' andindustrial estates - all, presumably,\\ndesigned to collect together sufficient labourandprovideadequate\\ninfrastructure for relatively large incoming plants. Incontrast, the\\ndemands oflocalindustry are foropening up access to the in-situ\\nlabourmarketsofsmall villages.\\nTheargument also takes place over aggregate supply-demand\\nrelations. TheStructure Planrecommends thatmoreopportunities\\nshouldbeprovided for people to increase their earnings and, quite\\nexplicitly, thatthepressure ofdemand forlabourshouldbe\\nincreased . All this goes down very badly with the Cornwall\\nIndustrial Development Association. The findings oftheStructure\\nPlan are based on a detailed analysis ofthe causes oflow pay and in\\nparticular oftherelationbetween pay and activity rates, as it might\\noperateinCornwall . The analysis pointsoutthatinCornwall both\\nfemale activity rate and average female wages are relatively low. It TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 223\\nshowsthatit is possible for employers to offer lower wages thanin\\nmanyotherplaces because there is a higher proportion of women\\npotentially able to work but not actually working, andhence less\\npressure ofdemand forlabour(p. 45). In reply, CIDA,in a\\nsubstantial document on regional policy andtheCornwall Struc\\xad\\nture Plan, mountsasustained attackonbranchplantsemploying\\nwomen and owned by big capital.Forwhile itarguesstrongly for\\nmore high-level technical andadministrative employment, more\\nunskilled andsemi-skilled jobsrepresent toCIDAonlymore\\ncompetition forlabour.Unlike the dominant elements ofcapital\\nin theheavy-industry regions, these industries are still locally-owned\\nandbased.Theyhavenotbeennationalised ,theyhavenot\\ndiversified geographically, they are more likely to overlapin their\\nlabourrequirements with the incoming industry, andthey are just\\nnot large enoughtocompete. Theyarguethat\\nWhatourplanning seeks to avoid is this: individual decisions by\\nonegroupofpeopleunwittingly upsetting theenvironment of\\notherpeople . . . if we encouraged the inflow ofnewCompanies\\nwith high \\'multiplier\\' effects, this would putgreatpressure on the\\nlocallabourmarket(possibly causingsomeotherfirms to become\\nunprofitable), more people would be attracted in to fill the jobsat\\nenhanced salaries, andin a recession the problems would all be\\nmagnified as the process went into reverse (CIDA1977, p. 102).\\nTheprovision ofmorejobsand/orhigher wages andsalariescan\\nonlyaddto thealready-strongpressures arisingfrominwards\\nmigration and are not therefore prime objectives. Indeed,it is\\ndoubtful whether Cornwall couldeverhave a high wage econo\\xad\\nmy: itwouldlead to a loss in profitability andadditional\\nunemployment, andhence would be self-defeating (p. 119).\\nOtherreservations aboutattracting newindustry also find expres\\xad\\nsion.CIDAisunreservedly pro-market andwaryofStateinterven\\xad\\ntion.Keegan(1980)characterises theregional CBI(SouthWest) as\\nthemostright wing oftheCBI\\'sregions:\\'theland where they still\\nbelieve in the phoenix\\'.Moreover, givenwhathasalreadybeen said\\naboutthenatureof small capitaland the new pettybourgeoisie in\\nthispartofthecountry, it is not surprising thatenvironmental\\nissues play a role in local politics. Cornwall had the only county\\ncouncil with an Ecology Partymember. Whatisironicisthatsuch 224SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconsiderations areprobably moreimportant to thein-migrant (but\\nalreadyarrived) self-employed andsmallentrepreneurs andalso,of\\ncourse, tosomeprofessionals ,such as estateagents,thanthey are to\\nlong-established localcapital.Indeed,CIDA\\'s initialformation (in\\n1974) was in partinresponse to a focus on environmentalism and\\nconservation whichhadtendedto reflect all industry in abadlight\\n(Wight, 1981).Environmental arguments are,however,nonetheless\\nusefulthingstomobilise in theoverallresistance totoomuch\\nincoming newindustry.

The overall patternofchangehas been contributed to\\nby the decline ofsomeindustries, thegrowthofothersand the\\ndevelopment ofnewspatialstructures in yetothers.

These\\nvariations inpartreflected changes in the economic situation over\\nthatperiod. But thatwas not all they reflected, for there were also,\\nover the same period,majorchanges in politics, in political alliances\\nand innational ideology and temperament. So it has notjustbeen\\nchanging economic circumstances which have been important but\\nalso changes in the way in which these economic pressures were\\nfiltered,moulded andtranslated through theprevailing political\\nand ideological climate.\\nThe endofthe long boom saw both the widening ofcracks in the\\nnational economy and the re-emergence of regional inequality as a\\npoliticalproblem. Since then there has at the political level been a\\nshifting search for a way out, both ofeconomic decline and ofthe\\nimpasse of political class stalemate .

And in each ofthesecontrasting economic-political\\nconjunctures ,\\'geography\\' and uneven development have played a\\ndifferent role.\\nThe first major section of this chapteranalyses this shifting\\npolitical and economic climate and the role ofgeography within it.\\nThe period as a whole isdivided very broadlyinto three: first, there\\nwas theattemptatmodernisation throughstructural intervention,\\nfrom the early sixties to the early seventies. This was followed by\\nthe relative political eclecticism of the mid-seventies, a period of\\n\\'holding thefort\\',but with a gradualshift within it, heralding the\\nthird sub -period, in which a social and political philosophy of\\nindividualism, competition and themarkethas been associated with\\nthedominance ofa strategy, in economic terms, ofprivate-sector,\\nmarket-based monetarism .\\nThe section deals with each oftheseperiodsinturn,and analyses\\ntheeconomic, and some ofthepolitical, determinants of this\\nshiftingpatternof change. It also pointsto thedifferent roleof\\n\\'geography\\' in each of these contrasting economic and political 228 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nconjunctures. Whatemerges clearly is that,not only has each of the\\nstrategies adopted in these different periodsfailed to \\'rescuethe\\nBritisheconomy\\', onanybody\\'s terms, but each has contributed \\xad\\nthoughindifferent ways - to perpetuating formsofgeographical\\ninequality .\\nBylookingagain at the economy and society as a whole, picking\\nup thestoryweintroduced at thebeginning ofChapter 4, and\\nattempting totakeseriously ourearlierstrictures that\\'the\\neconomic\\' does not arriveraw at the factory gate, these analyses\\npulltogether otheraspectsofthebackcloth to theshiftsin\\nindustries (investigated inChapter 4)andinareas(seeChap\\xad\\nter 5).Foras we have said, the \\'layers\\' within which particular\\nlocalities areembedded arenotonlyeconomic ; they are also\\npolitical andcultural.

This was, moreover, a\\nperiodwhen the world economy was still growing, and when there\\nwas still therefore much more roomformanoeuvre thanthere was\\nto beafter1973---4.Politically, too, theperiodwasdistinctive . Both\\nmainpartieshadacommitment tostructural intervention in Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 229\\nindustry. The 1964 election was foughtaroundthequestion of\\nwhichpartycould most speedily modernise theproduction baseof\\ntheeconomy. Itwasprobably theperiodwhen the British State\\ncamenearesttoholdingtogether aconsensus . Theeconomy was to\\nbesavedbyadvanced technology, modern management and\\n\\'rationalisation\\' .Inreturnthere was to be a measureofreform.It\\nwas astrategy founded on anattempt toconstruct an alliance\\nbetween big, private,\\'modern\\' capitalandLabour\\'s base in the\\nmanualworking classand,inpart,thetechnocratically orientated\\n\\'middlestrata\\'.Tothatextenttheheartoftheperiodwasthatof the\\nLabouradministration from 1964 to 1970, but as a whole it runs\\nfrom the earlier Conservative political and ideological shift towards\\nintervention, \\'planning\\', andincorporation oftheunions, for\\nexample throughtheestablishment ofNEDO,to theuttercollapse\\n(afterthe Selsdon interlude) in 1973-4.\\nThisattempted \\'alliance\\' was not between the whole ofcapital\\nand the whole of labour. As far as capitalwasconcerned the\\nleadingparticipants cameprimarily from big privateinterests in\\nmanufacturing industry. Asuccession oftheirmoreeminent\\nrepresentatives passedthrough Stateandpara-Stateorganisations.\\nArnoldWeinstock ,chairofGEC,epitomised theperiod. His style,\\nuncompromisingly profit-maximising andwithoutcommitment to\\nindustrial sector,region or workforce, contrasted sharplywiththat\\nin much of the rest ofBritishindustry and was proclaimed by\\nbusiness and government alike to be the type ofmanagement which\\ncould save the economy . Theemphasis was on size and modernity .\\nSmall,\\'old-fashioned\\' capitalwasmarginal to thestrategy, and\\nindeed there is evidence ofopposition from thatpartofcapital,at\\nleast to specific measures (see, forinstance, Jessop, 1979,p. 33).The\\nMachine ToolTradesAssociation, small old capitalpar excellence.\\nsuccessfully opposed theMinTech scheme to introduce aMachine\\nToolIndustry BoardundertheIndustrial Expansion Act(The\\nEconomist, 20July 1968,p. 60and 12 October 1968,p. 86). Norwas\\nthemodernising strategy given the wholehearted supportofthe\\nbanking sector. Indeed a degree ofpublicconflict occasionally\\nsurfaced between banking andmanufacturing - forinstance in the\\nlatter\\'sdissatisfaction with its financial and investment relationship\\nwith the City, in the oft-referred-to battlebetween the Department\\nofEconomic Affairs and the Treasury, and in the arguments over\\ntheproperty boom of the early 1970sand the notionofunproduc\\xad\\ntiveinvestment (Samuels et al..1975; Massey and Catalano, 1978; 230 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nJessop, 1979). This - capital\\'s armofthe alliance on which the\\nmodernisation strategywas based - was new. The direct representa\\xad\\ntionofmanufacturing industry in theState(forinstance in the\\nshapeoftheDEA)was aninnovation . And as Jessop(1979, p. 28)\\npointsout, until the formation ofthe CHI was sponsored by the\\nLabouradministration in 1965, there was no single peak organisa\\xad\\ntion torepresent industrial capitalin Britain.\\nTheattempttoincorporate theworking class in the strategyfor\\nmodernisation alsoincluded theappointment of\\'itsrepresentatives \\'\\ninStateandpara-State organisations , this, again, being a relatively\\nnewphenomenon (Jessop, 1979; PurdyandPrior, 1979). Harold\\nWilsoncelebrated thisinnovation (which had actuallybegununder\\ntheConservatives) by delivering himself of the following:\\nTheTUChasarrived.Itis anestateof the realm, as real, as\\npotent,as essentially partofthe fabric ofournational life, as any\\nofthe historic Estates.\\nIt isnoteasy for many within a movement thatgrew out of\\nrevolt to accept all the implications ofa rolethatnow iscreative,\\nconsultative and, in the centraleconomic struggle in which this\\nnationis involved, decisive. Influence and powercarrywith them\\nthe duties ofresponsibility. Never has this been more clearly\\nillustrated thanin thehistoricdecision oftheTradesUnion\\nCongress, fifteenmonthsago, to accept the need for an incomes\\npolicy which would relate the planned growthof wages to the\\nachieved growthinproductivity; which, indeed, went further, in\\nthatindividual unions,manyof them of great power, agreed to\\nsurrender to thecentralorganization somepartofthehistoric\\nsovereignty for which they hadbattledforoveracentury\\n(Wilson, 1974, p. 674).\\nThe hope in particular wasthattheunionleaders- andtherebythe\\nmembership - would co-operate bybearingtheimmediate burdens\\noftechnical changeandrestructuring - inotherwords,of\\n\\'modernisation\\'. In return,there was to be a strongelement of\\nsocialdemocratic reform. Just as Stateintervention inindustry was\\nseen in this period in a positive light across much ofthepolitical\\nspectrum,so also, and particularly in theLabourParty,there was a\\ncommitment to theexpansion of the Welfare State. Consistent with\\nthe faith in technology (which was presumed to beneutral) and\\norganisation (which was always seen as comingfrom the top down) Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 231\\nthistookthe form largely ofamajorexpansion oftheStatesector\\nand a range of reforming, ameliorative measures ,ameliorative in\\nmany cases precisely ofthe negative effects for working people\\nwhich\\'modernisation\\' was tobringin itstrain.Theintroduction of\\naredundancy payments act in 1965 was a classic case in point.\\nThethirdelement of the social base on which this strategydrew\\nwas a large section of the white-collar strata.Industry was to be\\nrevitalised bymodern management andtechnology , and social\\nproblems were conceived as being amenable tosolution through\\neducation and\\'rational\\', technocratic planning. TheCentrefor\\nEnvironmental Studieswas one of a wide rangeofinstitutions\\nestablished duringthisperiod(including also the SSRC,London\\nBusiness School and the Open University), andits earlyattempts to\\ncome to grips with urbanandregional problems were, typically for\\ntheperiod,concentrated onbuilding mathematical modelsof\\nspatialinteraction . (This was also, remember , theperiodwhen\\ngeography\\'s self-definition as a discipline centredon theconstruc\\xad\\ntion of \\'a science ofthespatial\\' in the contextofaquantitative\\nrevolution .Intellectual andsociopolitical philosophies fitted per\\xad\\nfectlytogether, and fed offeachother.)In such an atmosphere\\ntechnocrats ,business-school managers andsignificant elements of\\ntheeducational andsocial science community werecentralto the\\nrhetoricofbuilding the new Britain.\\nTheeconomic strategies whichcharacterised this period clearly\\nreflected the allianceon which they were based,andreflected too\\nthebalance ofpowerwithin it. The emphasis was on modern\\nproduction industries , on size andon high technology, and there\\nwas an explicit underplaying oftheprivateservicesectors.Within\\ntheemphasis onproduction industries there were two main foci.\\nFirst,there was to be financial restructuring andtechnological\\nupdating ofprivatemanufacturing , andparticularly ofmodern\\ncapital-goods sectors. Thisstrategywasdirected primarily to those\\nsectorswherebigcapitalwasalready dominant (computers ,\\nelectrical engineering ,cars)andthechanges reinforced that\\ndominance. TherewasNEOO, MinTech, theOEA,aNational\\nPlan.Productivity bargaining wasintroduced andthe Lanc aster\\nHouseConference onproductivity tookplaceamidafanfareof\\npublicity . TheIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation began its life\\nbyrestructuring majorsectors,smoothing the way to the centralisa\\xad\\ntion ofcapital,providing funds for investment. It,too,concentrated\\non the big andthemodern. And it was bothcharacteristics which 232 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmattered. Thedistinction was not simply between big and little\\ncapital.Smallcompanies inhigh-technology sectors and with a\\nreputation for\\'dynamism\\' weresupported .Nuclear Enterprises , at\\nthattime anindependent firm, was certainly small in employment\\nterms, and was owned by two brothers. But it was hardly an old\\xad\\nfashioned family firm. Itwas fast becoming a force in a highly\\ninternational industry. Said the IRC: \\'We are takinga couple of\\nentrepreneurs and backing them\\' (The FinancialTimes, 6December ,\\n1967). In totalcontrast, small old-fashioned capitalin long\\xad\\nestablished industries was completely external to the strategy. In\\nfaceofthe small capitalin wool textiles, the IRC gave up. \\'In\\nindustries where there is little movement, theIRCis helpless. The\\nwoolindustry is a good example. The majority offirms in this\\nextremely fragmented sector are small and family-owned. Their\\nposture is defensive and their interestinmodern management\\nmethods slight\\' (Smith, 1969, p. 93). But the emphasis on size\\nwasinescapable: widereconomic pressures, quiteapartfrom\\ngovernment stimulus, werepushing towards concentration and\\ncentralisation. Therewas amergerboom,especially among\\nalready-large firms (Whittington, 1972),and there was a significant\\nincrease in plantsize.The strictures oftheMonopolies and Mergers\\nCommission werespiritedaway(McClelland , 1972);competition, it\\nwasconfidently asserted, began abroad. There were relatively high\\nlevelsofinvestment , much of it replacement investment (Treasury ,\\n1976)indicating anupdating oftechniques ratherthan a simple\\nextension ofcapacity. Indeed, the rate ofgrowthofoutputbegan to\\nslow while, precisely up until 1973, the ratiobetween the rate of\\ngrowthoflabourproductivity and the rate ofgrowthofoutputwas\\nhigh (Singh, 1977). All this showed up in the employment statistics.\\nThe fastest rate ofemployment growth(number ofjobsperannum)\\ninmanufacturing was in those capital-goods industries based\\naroundnewtechnology ,particularly electronics.\\nThe second side ofthestrategy towards production industries\\nwas \\'rationalisation\\' oftheheavybasicsectors.Therewere\\nprogrammes forshipbuilding, the Devlin Reporton the docks\\nand steel was nationalised , but most ofall there were massive\\nclosures and reorganisation in the pits. Much ofthis, and the huge\\njoblosses which it involved, was carriedthroughwith the effective\\ncompliance ofthetradeunionleadership, thoughtherewas\\nresistance in some industries , such as steel (Cookeand Rees,\\n1981). Overall, this period saw a faster annuallevelofjobloss in Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 233\\nthesesectorsthan was seen in eitherthe first halfofthe sixties or\\nthe restofthe seventies.\\nThestrategy was also clearly reflected in the changes in the\\nserviceindustries. Thegrowthofserviceemployment slowed, in\\npartpossibly due to Selective Employment Tax,itselfareflection of\\nthe policy emphasis onmanufacturing, butthere were considerable\\ndifferences in the rate of employment change between different\\npartsofservices. Two sections dominated thegrowthinabsolute\\ntermsandgrew faster duringthisperiodthanin the years either\\nbefore or after: these were producer servicesandtheStatesector.\\nProducer servicescompletely dominated privatesectorgrowthin\\nserviceemployment, and this was a reflection ofwhatwas going on\\nin the wider economy : acommercial-office boomandaproperty\\nboom(Marquand, 1979,para.1.9), mergers andreorganisation in\\nmanufacturing (para.6.20),and- veryimportantly - thespreadof\\nthecomputer (para. I.I5). The social class implication ofthis was\\nthatthegrowthinemployment in these producer services \\'was\\nalmostentirelyagrowthinhigherlevelmanagerial andprofessional\\nemployment, as was much ofthegrowthin office employment in\\nthesecondary sectortoo...[suggesting] majorchanges in\\norganisational structure andbehaviour accompanying thegrowth\\nin office employment in the 1960s\\' (Marquand, 1979,para.1.15).It\\nwas a clear reflection ofthebroader changes going on in the\\neconomy andoftheemphasis onmodernisation andtechnology .\\nSo, too, was the enormous growthinStateemployment, in this case\\nbeing at least in parta reflection ofthereforming social-democratic\\nelementofthemodernising aIIiance, partofthequid pro quo.\\nPrivateconsumer services slowed in their rate ofemployment\\ngrowth, however, and smaII private-capital services, particularly in\\ndistribution, declined. Although dataaredifficult to come by, it\\nseems likely thatfrom 1964to the early 1970s there was a high rate\\nofmergeractivityin the service sectoralso(Bolton Committee,\\n1971;Marquand, 1979).Puttingthistogether withwhatwe know of\\nthe service industries fromChapter 4, it seems likely thatat least\\npartofthis was associated with the accelerated decline of petty\\xad\\nbourgeois ownership indistribution andmiscellaneous services with\\nthefurtherextension oflargercapitalist firms(Marquand, 1979,\\npara. 1.53 and ch. 7). (Certainly distribution was the only partof\\nthe service sectorwhichexperienced anabsolute decline in self\\xad\\nemployment over the whole periodbetween 1961and1975.) As in\\nthe restoftheeconomy, then, these differential changes within 234 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nservicesclearly reflected boththe overall economic changes and the\\ndifferent elements of the dominant political and economic strategy.\\n* * *\\'Geography\\' was integral to all this. Itwas notjustthatnational-\\nlevel processes were differentially mapped on to the British space\\nbutthatgeographical differentiation, distance and locational mo\\xad\\nbility themselves moulded, sometimes even enabled, the social and\\neconomic changes which took place. The particular characteristics\\nofthe period meantthatlocational mobility was a potentweapon in\\nthe hands ofmanagement. Inmanufacturing industry this was,\\noverall, a period ofjobloss, but it was a period ofpeculiarly \\'active\\'\\njobloss.Employment decline frequently took place in the contextof\\nmajorinvestment in newtechnology (Massey and Meegan, 1982).\\nSuch asituation provided ampleopportunities for dividing the\\nworkforce, thecombination oflocational flexibility with economic\\nslowdown being crucial. Thus\\'geography\\' played an active role in\\nthe frequent coincidence in the early partof the period between\\ntechnical change, or related means of increasing productivity, and\\nlocational shift.Locational changeandchanges inproduction\\nprocess were often partand parcel of each other. The category of\\n\\'intransit\\'lossesofemployment (Massey and Meegan, 1979) is\\nimportant here inhighlighting the fact thatthenumber ofjobs\\ngained at the \\'destination\\' end of such moves was often well below\\nthenumberofjobslost at the \\'origin\\'. Moreover, in many such\\ncases it was not justa net loss ofjobswhich was at issue but also a\\nchange in the natureofthe workforce. The very fact of distance and\\nofthepossibility oflocational changecouldoftenmakesuch\\n\\'restructuring\\' easier for management. Aboveall, itfrequently\\nconfused the issue. In this period new techniques , and changes in\\nlabourprocesses, were often introduced into the production of\\nexisting levels ofoutput,ratherthanbeingembodied inextra\\ncapacity. This had two effects. First, if the changes were introduced\\non site, in an existing factory,theinvestment itselfappeared to be\\nresponsible for the loss ofjobs.\\'Technology\\' became the enemy.\\nNewinvestment came to be feared as probably leading only to\\nreductions inemployment. Second, the new investment in the new\\ntechniques ofproduction might take place in anotherregion - in a\\nperipheral ornon-conurbation area,forinstance, whereas the\\nexistingcapacity was in the city. However, because this was taking\\nplacein aperiodofslowdown, because it wasnotpossible\\nsubstantially to increase output,the new investment in the new Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 235\\nprocesses had often to be compensated for byclosureof the existing\\nfactory. In this case, the issue again oftencame to be definedin\\ntermsofcompetition between different areas-thoseaboutto be\\nmaderedundant in theinnercities could only too easily interpret the\\nsituation as the regions ofnewinvestment \\'takingtheirjobs\\'. Had\\nthe newtechnique beenintroduced as anextension tocapacity it is\\nunlikely thatit would have been foughtby theunions.Indeed, it\\nwouldprobably have been welcomed as providing newemployment.\\nSuch asituation will typify periodsofgrowth.The real problem, of\\ncourse,wasneither\\'technology \\'northecompetitive demands of\\nworkers inotherareas,butthecontinued effortstoincrease\\nproductivity when the rate ofoutputgrowthwas slowing down.\\nInotherways, too, geography wascentralto theperiod.Regional\\nconsiderations andregional policy\\'wereimportant aspectsbothof\\ntheconstruction ofthepolitical allianceofthisperiodandof the\\nattempted solution to theeconomic andpolitical problems which\\npresented themselves. The end ofthe long boomhad seen the re\\xad\\nemergence of the regional problem as apolitical issue. The onset of\\neconomic problems washeralded by falls in employment in the\\nbasicindustries in the early 1960s. Indeed, the very returnofa\\nLabourGovernment in 1964, and the full establishment ofthe\\npolitical strategyofthisperiodhas to be seen in this context. In\\n1963, the Conservatives hadtakenfirefighting measures to quell\\npotentialdiscontent intheworst-hit regions (thenorth-east of\\nEngland, andScotland). It was the beginning of there-establish\\xad\\nment of regional policy. In 1964 the LabourPartywasreturned to\\npowerwith anelectoral baseprimarily inwhatwere to become the\\nDevelopment Areasandwithsignificant promises inboththe\\nManifesto andtheQueen\\'s Speech of a commitment toregional\\npolicy.\\nThestrength of theLabourPartyin these regions (see Chapter 5)\\nwas thus an important supportofthenational-level alliancewhile,\\nprecisely becauseone side of thatalliancehad astrongly-coherent\\nregional basis (at least in terms of labour-movement leadership),\\nregional policy was an important component ofholdingtogether\\nthenational politics.Bothsidesofthisequation were to be\\nparticularly important given the serious joblosses which subse\\xad\\nquentlyresultedfrom the rationalisation of someofthecore-sectors\\nin these regions, andinparticular ofcoal-mining .Therewas a real\\npotential conflict here.Ontheonehandtheelectoral and\\norganisational strength of thegovernment lay inperipheral regions 236SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nwhich were alreadysuffering above-average, and increasing, levels\\nofunemployment. There was real pressure, from regions such as the\\nnorth-east, for action. On the otherhandoneofthecentralaimsof\\nthe Wilson government in itsattempttomodernise theeconomy\\nwas torationalise the heavy basic sectors. As we have seen, this\\nprogramme resulted in massive losses ofjobs. Some 48000jobs\\nwere lost in the pits in Durham injustfour years between 1964and\\n1968. And these industries, andconsequently thejoblosses, were\\nconcentrated precisely in the regions ofLabour\\'s base and electoral\\nstrength. Regional policy, and the promise ofotherjobsto replace\\nthose fast disappearing, waspartofthe means ofacquiring the\\ncompliance oftradeunionleaders.Majorclosures in particular\\nareaswerefrequently compensated for by a grantofSpecial\\nDevelopment Areastatus. The existence ofalternative employment\\nhad always encouraged a high level ofvoluntary redundancy from\\nmining, which would clearly ease any rank-and-file objection to the\\nrationalisation .Inotherwords, at the startofthis period not only\\nwere there already calls for a regional policy, but a commitment to\\nsuch a policy was to be even more necessary if the cutbacks in the\\nbasic sectors were to be pushed through. Thesupportofthelabour\\nmovement - or at least its leaders - in those regions was therefore\\nimportant to economic policy-making at bothnational and regional\\nlevels,and in its turn,regional policy was important in gaining that\\nsupport.\\nThesignificance ofregional policy,however, even at the\\nbeginning ofthisperiod,also had anotheraspect. This concerned\\nthe reserves oflabourin the old heavy-industry peripheral regions.\\nThese reserves included notjusttheunemployed but also the\\nreservesoflabourimplied by the low activity rates in the regions\\n(seeChapter 5).Inthe 1950sone ofthe pressures towardsregional\\npolicy had been concern abouttheinflationary effectofgeogra\\xad\\nphically-differentiated pressure on the labourmarket(seeChap\\xad\\nter 4). By the next decade, however, the problem was initially\\nperceived as being one ofpotential \\'absolute\\' shortage: one of the\\nmainconstraints onnationaleconomic growthwas expected to be a\\nshortage oflabour. TheNational Plan of 1965 predicted anannual\\nrateofgrowthofoutputof4 per cent, and the chiefobstacleto the\\nachievement ofthis was thought to bepotential \\'bottlenecks\\', of\\nwhich one ofthe most important was expected to be thatoflabour.\\nA\\'manpower gap\\'of800000wascalculated , and regional policy,\\nbyevening-out unemployment and activity rates, was to provide Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 237\\nhalfofthatextralabour.At precisely thattime,ofcourse, the\\naccelerated decline of the heavy industries, itself aproduct of\\ngovernment policy, was substantially addingto these reserves of\\nlabour, both male (through unemployment) and female (through\\nfreeing women on to the labourmarket). Development Areas,\\nwhereregional policyincentives wereavailable , weredefined\\nbroadly, toencompass not only areas ofhighunemployment but\\nalsopotential foci for growth, andspatialreorganisation within\\nthem (see Chapter 5) made conditions ready. The quotations in\\nFigure6.1indicate theargument and also the importance of\\nregional policy in this respect. The earlier role ofhelping to damp\\ndowninflationary pressures was also mentioned , but now in a\\nsecondary position. Thesummary ofthe role ofregional policy\\nadded: \\'At the same time a more even spreadofemployment\\nthroughout thecountrywillhelp to avoid regional pocketsofexcess\\ndemandsetting the pace in driving up costs and prices while there\\nare still unused resources elsewhere\\' (p. II).\\nRegional policy, in otherwords, was to be used to create space\\nfor the projected growth. Looked at anotherway, what this meant\\nwasthatregional policy, by increasing the supply of labour, would\\nbe oneinstrument inbreaking the increased economic power which\\nworkers had gained duringthe expansive growthofthe previous\\nperiod. In relation to \\'theworking class\\' the policy was thus quite\\ncontradictory . It was bothapay-off to aparticular sectionofthat\\nclass (a section defined spatially - theparty\\'spolitical base in the\\nregions) and at the same time it was a way of undermining the\\neconomic strength oflabourmore generally, but a strength which,\\ngiven the geography of the previous decade\\'s economic growth, was\\nspearheaded by workers in the midlands andsouth-east.\\nNorwere the otherdeterminants ofregional policy simply a\\nquestion oftherequirements of\\'capital\\' as some undifferentiated\\nwhole, or ofsomeaggregated notionof\\'accumulation \\' atnational\\nlevel. Regional policy was, rather,a response to the requirements of\\nparticular partsofcapital.Notonly was big capitalexpanding\\nfaster than small up to and over this period,but it was also more\\nlikely to be able both to shift geographically - or to set up branches\\nin newlocations - and to use the kind of reserves oflabour\\navailable.i This was not, then, some kind of\\'trade-off\\' between\\npotential social and economic roles for regional policy, but a\\ncombination oftherequirements ofdifferent partsofthe social\\nstructure, the result ofthe historically-specific configuration ofthe 238SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThe reserve of labour in the less prosperous regions\\n7. Over the last 10 years an average of420,000 workers have been\\nunemployed in the United Kingdom atanyone time; and the incidence ofthis\\nunemployment variesconsiderably between regions. If the unemployment rate in\\nthe lessprosperous regions could be reduced to the average for GreatBritain\\nover the last 10years (which is also the actual rate in 1964)some 100,000 more\\npeople would be employed in those regions. The main increases would be in\\nScotland (37,000) and Northern Ireland (28,000), and the North-Western\\nRegion,Northern RegionandWaleswouldeach gain 12,000. (In this\\ncalculation the national average unemployment rate has been taken as a\\nconvenient measuring rod; but otherstandards could be used, such as the\\nlowest regional rate.) It would be imprudent to assume thatthe whole 100,000\\naddition toemployment could be achieved by 1970; but with effective policies to\\nincrease employment opportunities in the less prosperous regions, it should be\\npossible to reduce the numbers unemployed by some 50,000 duringthe plan\\nperiod.\\n8. There are also some (amongold people and marriedwomen, for example)\\nwho might be willing to enteror remain in the working population in certain\\ncircumstances. Activity rates ofoldermen (the proportion ofthe group which is\\nin theworking population) have been declining, particularly with the spread of\\nstate and privateoccupational pension schemes, and the forecasts in paragraph 2\\nassume a continuing though slower decline. If this were halted, and 1964activity\\nratesmaintained, there would beabout50,000 more men in the labourforce in\\n1970.The forecasts of working population alreadyinvolve a continuing increase\\nin activity rates of married women above the age of 35;but they still assume that\\nsome 3 million married women between 45 and 65 will not be in the labourforce\\nin 1970.\\n9. Activity rates in the countryas a whole are higher now than in 1943, at\\nthe height ofmobilisation of manpower resources in the Second World War.\\nThey are also higher than in the United States and amongthe highest in Western\\nEurope. But the differences between activity rates in the different regions give\\nsomeindication ofthe scope for drawing extrapeople into the working\\npopulation ifemployment opportunit ies were more equally distributed . Some\\nof the differences in regional activity ratesare due to variations in theproportion\\nofthepopulation in each region which can be regarded aspotentially\\neconomically active; and the calculations in Table 3.1 make an allowance (in\\nthe second column) for those who are retired, being educated or in institutions.\\nThe third column of the table then shows that if activity rates in the regions\\nwhere they are below average could be raised to the national average, the\\naddition to thelabourforce in GreatBritain would be around320,000.\\nPractically all of this increase would be made up ofwomen. In addition\\n40,000 extra people might be drawn into the working population inNorthern\\nIreland if activity rates there could be raised to the national average. It would\\nnot be practical however, to expect to bring the whole ofthis extra 360,000 into\\nthelabourforce by 1970. Itwould be a substantial achievement to gethalfway\\ntowards this goal. Class.

The rationale for regional policy has to be under\\xad\\nstoodas acombination ofresponses, to social and political\\npressures, and to economic requirements.\\nFurther, we have alreadyseen inChapter 5thatthe regional\\nbasesofthis alliance tookaparticular form. It was not justa\\nquestion ofcountry-wide alliances between social groups but ofa\\nwhole series ofstructures, often with fairly coherent regional-level\\nexistences. Chapter 5 referred to the construction of a politics of\\nconsensus incertainregions. These were \\'regional\\' structures in\\ntermsofboththeirsocial bases andtheiraims.Theywere\\nconstructed toaddress regional problems, but they were also\\nfundamental tonational-level strategy. It was through themthat\\nacquiescence was won for the modernising strategyat regional level;\\nfor thespatial, social and economic restructuring ofthese areas. All\\nofthis was crucial to the national strategy.\\nFairlyquickly, however, the \\'economic\\' aspectsofthe role of\\nregional policy underwent a shift. While much ofthe original\\nargument for regional policy (in the first halfofthe 1960s) was\\ncouched in terms of expanding the supply of labour,by 1966\\nunemployment over the country as a whole was startingto rise\\nsteeply. While, given the continuing political commitment to\\ninternational competition in open world markets, it wascertainly\\nnecessary for industry to cut costs, and true thatthis could be aided\\nbybothmoving in search ofcheaper labourandexpanding the\\noverall supply, there was no immediate prospect ofsome kind of\\n\\'absolute\\' shortage oflabour.Insteadofoutputmarching aheadby\\n4 per cent a year, its rate ofgrowthfell off. The problem for the\\npotentially expanding sectionsofcapitalbecame one ofretaining \\xad\\nand if possible increasing -competitiveness ratherthanone of\\nfinding sufficient elbow-room to grow. In this contextregional\\npolicy played a role in whatcame to be called \\'restructuring\\'. For\\nindividual firms,investment grants(asopposed to the previous\\nsystem of depreciation allowances) were especially useful in the\\ncontextofliquidity problems and relatively low profits. In that\\ncontext,regional policy and the changes in industry weremutually\\nreinforcing . On the one handchanges in production couldbe a\\nprecondition foradvantage to betakenof regional policy; on the\\notherhandthegrantsavailable through regional policy could\\nencourage orevenenablethosechanges bysubsidising the\\ninvestment in the new processes ofproduction . But not only did\\ntheeconomic roleofregional policy change over time, its impact Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 241\\nalso varied between sectors.Mostobviously, it was simply more\\nimportant in some sectors than othersas afactorinlocational\\nchange. But more thanthis, regional policy combined indifferent\\nways indifferent industries withotherdevelopments takingplace at\\nthe time. The wayitactually operated was also different. Notall\\nindustries were \\'restructuring\\' in the same manner. Inclothing, for\\ninstance, there was no majorreorganisation ofproduction processes\\nwhichenabled decentralisation. Here it was more a question of\\ncompetition forlabour(Chapter 4). Inothersectorssimilar\\ndecentralisation tookplacewithout regional policyplayingany\\nrole. This was the case in services (although SET may have had a\\ndifferential effect). In the service industries as a whole, while overall\\ngrowthwas relatively low, there was still some growthand it was\\nprecisely in those parts(except for local authority services) which\\nare lesslocationally tied to local population (i.e.producer services,\\ncentralState,etc.). It was duringthisperiodthatthespatial\\nseparation anddecentralisation of clerical work began, much ofit\\nat this time going to Wales. So each ofthe three majorsectors\\nexamined in Chapter4, allofwhichdecentralised jobs- and similar\\njobs- over the period,did so with very different relationships to\\nregional policy.\\nIt has been arguedelsewhere (Massey, 1979) that\\'theeffectsof\\nregional policy\\'cannotbetreatedas amattersimplyofthe\\ngeographical distributionofnumbers ofjobs.Thisanalysisofthe\\nlate sixties andearlyseventies showsjusthowcomplex and\\nchanging its role, and consequently its effects, can be.

In some individual casesthatundoubtedly was the\\nsituation,butoverall the role and place ofregional policy was far\\nmore complex. Regional policy was an integral, ifchanging, partof\\nboththe economics and the politics oftheperiod.\\nTable 6.1 pulls out some ofthe more specific characteristics of\\nemployment changeduringthis period. While none ofthe general\\ntrendsis new, or confined to thisperiod,it is also clear thatthere\\nwas at this time a particular condensation ofmanyof thedifferent\\nelements in the overall, much longer-term shift between nationally\\xad\\ndominant spatialdivisions of labour.Otherchangesreinforced this\\nshift.

This was the late sixties, and the more general\\nrevival of socialist political culture,and of radical movements based\\naroundgroupsotherthantradeunions, saw little attraction in the\\nLabourParty.\\nTherewere also othermorematerial reasons for disenchantment\\namongthose whose jobswere affected by the policies. Unemploy\\xad\\nmentcontinued to grow apace, incomes policies were imposed and\\nthere were attacksonpreviously-established unionrights.Techno\\xad\\nlogical change in industry, beingintroduced so late, when economic\\ngrowthhadalreadybegun to slow down, provoked fierceopposi\\xad\\ntion, as did - more obviously -closureandrationalisation .Arnold\\nWeinstock became a bitenoireofthelabourmovement\\' Regional\\npolicy had contributed to themovement ofjobstoDevelopment\\nAreas, and those regions\\'relativeunemployment rates were indeed\\nfalling, but absolute rates (which are, perhaps, whatmattersmore)\\ncontinued to rise.Moreover , the fact thatsuch a high proportion of\\ntheincoming jobswere for women, ofwhom in turna high\\nproportion had previously not been \\'economically active\\',meant\\nthattheunemployment was not reduced by an equivalent amount.\\nThis, and the fact thatthejobswere often lower-paid and less\\ndemanding ofindustrial skills,meantthattheyprovided little direct\\nrelief for redundant miners and steel -workers (seeChapter 5) \\xad\\nthose, in otherwords, for whom regional policy had apparently\\nbeenpartofthebargain.Thelabour-movement sideofthe alliance,\\nundersuch acombination ofcircumstances ,couldhardlybe\\nexpected to hold up. In 1969 Wilson\\'s reception at theTUC\\nconference was frosty; in 1970 the LabourPartylost the election\\nto agovernment with no basis at all for such an alliance (and\\nindeed which went to the countryin 1974with a challenge - which\\nfailed -againstthe regional \\'core-sector\\').\\nMoreover, manufacturing industry also refused to react in the\\npolitically-desired manner.Notso much antagonism asinertia\\ncharacterised its response. The more dynamic sectorscontinued\\nthepredilection for investing abroad, and indeed many ofthe\\npoliciesofthe period reinforced this or ientation . TheIRC,by\\nencouraging sizeandinternational competitiveness, produced\\ncontradictory results, as international competitiveness , for the Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 245\\ncompanies, meantnot so much exporting asinvesting abroad\\n(Singh, 1975; Massey and Meegan, 1979). The conflict between\\nthetraditional world role and the modernisation oftheeconomy\\nhadnotbeengrappled with,andthe net resultin so far as\\nmanufacturing industry wasconcerned was toreinforce it, by\\nstrengthening thosesections whoseinfluence on policy putin\\nsecond place the healthofthe UKinternaleconomy .Later,EEC\\nentrydid much the same (Gray,1982).\\nTherewas,moreover, morestraightforward opposition from\\notherpartsofcapital.Banking capital, the fraction more used to\\nholdingpower, had throughout been more ambiguous in itsrelation\\nto thestrategy(Jessop, 1979,p. 102),and its opposition waspartof\\ntheeventual undermining ofthe policy. By 1967, with devaluation,\\nthecontradictions shouldhave been obvious. But\\'thefatal\\npersistence in the belief thatno choice was necessary gravely\\nundermined themodernisation strategy of the 1960s and wrecked\\nmanyofthe reforms which it launched\\' (Gamble, 1981, p. 102).\\nWith such uncertain adherents thestrategycouldnot survive the\\nworsening economic situation . While some restructuring had been\\nachieved, the economy continued to decline. The political stale\\xad\\nmate had not been broken.\\nMuddling through\\nThe rest ofthe 1970s was a period of greatervariability, in terms\\nbothofeconomic strategyandofthe social basis on which it was\\nbuilt. The periodbegan with the inheritance ofthe Wilson and\\nHeathgovernments .Therewas, in the early years, a high level of\\ngrass-roots unionmilitancy and aunionleadership which, until\\n1975,inclined towardsthe left. While much ofthis renewed activity\\nremained still within the old defensive, sectionalist terms(Hodgson,\\n1981),therewere also morepositive experiments, particularly\\nduring1974,with TonyBenn at the Ministry ofIndustry. Labour\\'s\\nProgramme 1973, with its emphasis onmultinational capital(the\\nmeso-economic sector) and the problems oftrade,represented the\\nbeginnings ofarecognition ofthepersistent conflict between\\ninternal economy andinternational role(Gamble, 1981).There\\nwas also increasing recognition ofthe need to shift the locus of\\npowerwithinindustry through anextension ofindustrial demo\\xad\\ncracy. 246 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nNoneoftheseinitiatives, however, was tolastorbearfruit.The\\neconomic strategy of1973 was transformed beyond recognition\\nfromanassault oninternational capital topowerless \\'Sector\\nWorking Parties\\', one\\'Planning Agreement\\' ,andagradual slide\\nintomonetarism .Someofthelonger-term themeswerecontinued :\\nmodernisation(though nowmoremuted), continual financial\\npressure (epitomised by theIMFdrama)andtheattempts togain\\nagreement fromtheunionstopolicieswhichinevitably, intheshort\\ntermatleast,meanthigherunemployment andlowerwages. Butthe\\noverallpolitical climatewasdifferent fromthatofthe sixties.\\nThisdifference wasreinforced by,andinteracted with,other\\ncontrasts .Mostimportantly, thewidereconomic situation wasnow\\nspectacularly different.

Byearly1977, at least20percentof\\nexisting productive capacity in theGECDas awholewasstanding\\nidle(Coates, 1980, p. 36). All this, combined with the moremuted\\nmodernisation policy,showedup in the fall-offin investment andin\\ntherateofgrowthofproductivity after1973(Singh, 1977).Italso\\nhadawidereffect on policy.TheLabourgovernment, adopting an\\nemphasis onholdingbackinflation, was by 1975 -6beginning tocut\\nbackon thegrowthofpublicexpenditure (andwhatthismeantwas\\nexpenditure onwelfareandrelatedservices-Stateaid toindustry\\nincreased) .\\nThisperiodwasalsodifferent fromthesixtiesinthatthe\\nemphasis wasnowlessexclusively on big, manufacturing capital\\n(inspiteoftheclearanalysis in Labour\\'s Programme 1973).The\\nNational Enterprise Board,whichtheparty\\'sProgramme wishedto\\nseeestablish somedegreeofpublicownership inthelargest\\ncompanies ,instead (withashoestring budgetandpolitics the\\nopposite ofradicalinterventionism), concentrated itsmainefforts\\nonsmallandmedium-sized businesses (Coates, 1980, p. 116).

These were by no means\\nall, or specifically, directed at small capital,butmanysuchsectors\\nwere involved, including wool textiles (on which the IRChad\\nrefused to act), clothing, ferrous and non-ferrous foundries and\\nmachine tools. In clothing, forinstance, a special Clothing Industry\\nProductivity Resources Agency was established ,andfirms in the\\nindustry were eligible, as partoftheIndustrial Strategy, for the\\nspecial scheme ofassistance underSection 8 oftheIndustry Act.\\nSimilarly, the qualifying sizeofnewinvestment for theAccelerated\\nProjects Scheme and its successor, Selective Investment Scheme,\\nwere set relatively low. Innercity policies, too, tendedto lay\\nconsiderable emphasis on small firms and the end oftheperiod\\nsaw the heady but relatively short-lived enthusiasm for the United\\nStatesfindingsofBirch(asserting theimportance ofemployment\\ngrowthin small firms), while there was a general shift in all areasof\\nsubnational economic policytowards \\'indigenous growth\\', an\\nemphasis which had muchthesameimplications .Thisshift\\ntowards smallerfirms had a number of bases.

Certainly, as we shall see, it wasto\\nhavespatialimplications.\\nTherewere two otherways,alreadyimpliedbutworthnoting\\nexplicitly, in which this perioddiffered from the sixties.

It was a less\\n\\'active\\'periodofdecline. Certainly it seems possible thatthe\\npotential fordecentralising evenassembly workwasreduced. At\\nthesametime,however, thefasterdeclineinemployment in\\nmanufacturing as awhole,themajorlosses in consumer goods,\\nandinparticular inthoseconsumer-goods sectorsdominated by\\nsmallcapital, left the urbanareasandolderindustrial regions\\nparticularly vulnerable.

Producer servicescontinued to grow thoughat a slightly\\nlower rate, and they were proportionally lessimportant. The office\\nandcomputer boom was less evident. The balanceinconsumer\\nservices shifteddramatically frompublictoprivate, which in\\ngeneral would indicate aworsening oftheir regional distribution\\n(seeChapter4), butpublic-sector servicesnevertheless continued to\\ngrow and thus to retainsome significance as a countervailing force\\nin terms ofthe regional distribution ofdifferent typesofemploy\\xad\\nment.Puttingall thistogether, andremembering itsemphasis on\\nmanufacturing, it is evident thatregional policy had less roomfor\\nmanoeuvre thanduringtheprevious decade.\\n* * *This was reinforced bychanges in thestatusofthe policy itself.\\nIndeed, once again, geographical unevenness and spatialpolicy were\\nintegralto the whole story. Between 1972 and 1979 spatialpolicy\\nbothchanged in form and as a whole became less important in\\nrelationtonational economic policy. In terms of regional policy,\\nthissubordination began with the increased sectoralemphasis of the\\nConservatives\\' Industry andFinanceActs and was continued under\\ntheLabourGovernment\\'s Industrial Strategy (Johnstone, 1979). In\\nthelatterthedecreasing importance ofregional policy can be\\ndetected in thedeclining proportion ofStatefinancial aid to\\nindustry beingawarded on regional grounds, in therelaxation of\\nIDes,the ending of REP, and in the actualspatialbalanceofsome\\nof themajorsectoral policies, which favoured non-Development\\nAreas(Cameron, 1979). This has often been interpreted as regional\\npolicy\\'s being a primarily social and redistributive policy, and being\\ntraded-off againstnational economic imperatives .Thereis an\\nelement of truthin this, but there were also otherthreadsto the\\nstory. We have alreadyarguedthatregional policy itself had not up\\nto thispointanyway been playinga solely\\'welfare\\' role. In fact two\\nthings seem to have been going on. First,theconditions within\\nwhich regional policy had been playingits\\'economic\\' role in aiding\\naccumulation inpartsofindustry, forinstancewithinrestructuring,\\nwere themselves receding. Manufacturing employment was declin\\xad\\ning at an increased rate, but further,thatdecline was combined with\\nlow rates of investment and a fall-off, as we have seen, in the rate of\\ngrowthofproductivity .\\'Potentially-mobile-manufacturing employ\\xad\\nment\\'is thus likely to have fallen even more thanthe simple\\nemployment numbers would suggest, for less oftheemployment\\ndecline seems to have been takingplace in the contextofinvestment 250SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nin new techniques (Massey andMeegan, 1982).Undersuch\\ncircumstances regional policy would be less use to capital, either\\nas simple aid or, perhaps moreparticularly, because the newly\\xad\\navailable workforces oftheDevelopment Areaswould no longerbe\\nrelevant. Thesenewworkforces were on the whole moreuseful to\\nbigthanlittlecapital.But as we have seen, national industrial policy\\nwas now extended tosignificant sectionsofsmallcapital,andthese\\nschemes were takenup bysectorsbothwithinandoutsideassisted\\nareas.However for small capital,regional policy was unlikely to\\nplay much of a role in any process of restructuring .Take, for\\ninstance, thefoundryandmachine toolindustries, forbothofwhich\\nsectoral schemes operated . Both are located primarily outside\\nDevelopment Areas,botharedominated by small companies and\\nbothareprimarily male-employing .Forprecisely these reasonsthe\\nincentives ofregional policy would be largely irrelevant. Such small\\nfirms are less locationally mobile,andwould be more likely to\\npreferinvestment in situ.Moreover inmostcases in these industries\\nnewinvestment , even in more modern techniques, rarely led to\\nincreased employment ofwomen, andtherefore the reserves of\\nfemalelabourin theDevelopment Areas were oflittlepotential\\nuse.(Andtheattractions ofamaleworkforce recently made\\nredundant from the NCBor BSC are likely to have been minimal\\nto the\\'smallbusinessman\\' ofthe west midlands .) In this contextthe\\neasingofIDCcontrols musthave been particularly welcome \\xad\\nindeeditseems to have reflected boththisprocessandthereduced\\npressure onlabourmarkets in thecentralareas. Aswouldbe\\nexpected given these arguments, regional policybecameover the\\n1970s less effective in terms ofjobcreation in theDevelopment\\nAreas(Moore, et al.,1977; Massey andMeegan, 1982).\\nWhatwashappening over this period,then,wascertainly that\\nregional policy was increasingly subordinate tonational industrial\\npolicy,butalsothattheregionalpolicy itself was in partareflection\\nof(orwenthandinhandwith) its own declining role as an armof\\nnational industrial policy.Therewere also, ofcourse,political\\nconditions whichenabled, orencouraged, a decline in emphasis on\\nregional policy as a purelyredistributive mechanism . Inparticular,\\nunemployment in non-Development Areaswas rising. They had no\\njobs\\'tospare\\'. In theinnercities,equivalent problems ofpoverty\\nandunemployment werebeginning to take on seriouspolitical\\nproportions .Undersuchcircumstances, it was not inconvenient to\\nletregional policy be blamedfor decline elsewhere anddifficult to Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 251\\ncontinue it as such a majorelement ofStatepolicytowards\\nindustry.\\nIncontrast to themodernisation period,therefore, whenregional\\npolicy had had an impactpartlybecauseofthestrength ofits\\noperation andpartlybecause theconditions existed in which it\\ncouldsucceed, in this laterperioditbothhad less roomfor\\nmanoeuvre economically and was subordinated politically.\\nTheincreasing geographical spreadofhigh levels ofunemploy\\xad\\nmentexacerbated the specifically spatialcompetition forjobs,and\\nworkers indifferent partsofthecountry, defining themselves as\\nworkers fromparticular regions, werethrownintoconflictfor the\\nfew newjobsthatwerearound.This was sharpened by the fact that\\nmuchoftherhetoricofStatepolicy was gearedto aninterpretation\\nofregional or localunemployment as a result ofthe failings ofthe\\nparticular areasinquestion (a lack of skills, a lack ofentrepreneur\\xad\\nship, too much \\'bureaucracy\\' on thepartoflocalplanners, too\\nmuchmilitancy on thepartoflocalworkers). Andinmanycases,\\nbecauseoftheimmediacy ofthe local problems, the issue was taken\\non in those terms. Forspatially separate interests are real; the high\\nnational levelofunemployment was unevenly distributed between\\nareas.\"Regions are thus set in competition with each other.The\\nexample ofInmosinFigure6.2, for whichnearly100 local\\nauthoritie scompeted , wasjustoneofmanyduringthisperiod.\\nMerseyside workers demanded work for Merseyside ,innercity\\ngroupscomplained thatregional policy was responsible fortheir\\nlossofjobsand there were rival claims to have the highestlocalrate\\nofunemployment. Notonly did this divide peoplein one region\\nfromthoseinanother, anddivertattention from the overall\\nproblem ofunemployment , it also prepared thegroundfor local\\nattacksontradeunions.Itwas theworkersofMerseyside who drew\\nmostattention on this score, the decline oftheareabeingfrequently\\nblamedontheirlackof\\'discipline \\'.

It was the\\nconurbations - Merseyside, Clydeside and Newcastle - which led\\ntheareas\\'accelerated jobloss. It was what Townsend (1982)aptly\\ncalls the intersection ofregional and urbanproblems, thatisofthe\\n\\'traditional\\' regional problem and the now accelerated decline of\\noldermanufacturing more generally - the intersection, inother\\nwords,oftheimpactof two shifts in the international division of\\nlabour.\\nThepatternofgeographical differentiation injobtypeand\\noccupational structure continued to bereproduced ,thoughagain\\nwithdifferences from the earlierperiod.Overall, thespatial\\ncentralisation ofcontrol, andtheestablishment andspatial\\nconcentration ofmanagerial hierarchies in thesouth-east, contin\\xad\\nued,thoughat a slower rate. \\'General management \\'remained over\\xad\\nrepresented inGreater London and the rest ofthesouth-east\\n(ROSE) throughout theperiod, and indeed increased its over\\xad\\nrepresentation (Kirwan, 1981). Exactly the reverse was true for\\nthenorth, and Wales and Scotland, whereunder-representation was\\nreinforced .Moreover , \\'assistant management\\' (which includes the\\nwholegamutofprofessional support) showed exactly the same\\npattern.\"\\nBut if the picturewas clear for management, thatfor profes\\xad\\nsionals in science, technology andengineering was much more\\nmixed. This could reflect the decline in importance ofproducer\\nservices, bothas aproportion ofemployment changeand in their\\nown rate of growth(though thecategory also includes the more\\nproduction-based engineering technologists - seeChapter 4). It\\nwould be interesting toexploretheseconnections further.Certainly\\none can detectthedeclining emphasis onmodernisation and\\ntechnical change.\\nAt theotherend of the occupational structure, too, thecharacter\\nof the period left its imprint.Although therecontinued tobea shift\\nwithin women\\'s employment towardsassembly work, there was an 254SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nabsolute overalI decline in numbers, reflecting the declines in new\\nmeans-of-production industries andinconsumer goods.In alI\\nregions this kind of employment for women felIinimportance ,\\nand the biggest losers included theDevelopment Areasofthesouth\\xad\\nwest, the northandWales. The northactualIy moved into deficit\\nover the period(NewEarnings Survey). In otherwords, while,\\nexcept for the north,all theDevelopment Areasremained \\'over\\xad\\nrepresented\\', the(net)processofmovement ofthesejobsto\\nperipheral regionsdid notcontinue in anyconsistent mannerover\\nthisperiod.\"\\nBut while there was hesitation in thedecentralisation ofassembly\\njobsfor women, the decentralisation ofclericaljobs - as would be\\nimplied by the aggregate economic changes-continued throughout\\ntheperiod.GreaterLondon, ROSEandEastAngliaalldecreased\\ntheirrepresentation. Incontrast, thenorthofEngland, thesouth\\xad\\nwest,Scotland andWales all increased their relative proportions of\\nthesejobs- in the cases ofthe first three, very significantly (Kirwan,\\n1981).9\\nAll these shifts in balancecan thus be understood inrelationto\\nthenational changes discussed earlier.Manyofthetrendsofthe\\nprevious periodcontinued .Management continued its process of\\nspatialcentralisation , clerical work continued todecentralise . But\\nthe speed andbalanceofthedifferent components changed.There\\nwas a less spectacular rateofconcentration ofmaleprofessional\\nworkers in thesouth-east ofEngland, thebalanceofwomen\\'s jobs\\ndecentralising (relatively) to the peripheral regionsshiftedmore\\ntowardsclerical work. The basic sectorscontinued to decline, butat\\na slower rate. Overall, the shift between spatialdivisions oflabour\\nat thebroadnational levelcontinued but,reflecting economic and\\npolitical changes, it did so more haltingly andin adifferent form.\\n***\\nTheCallaghan government was slowly shipwrecked on thecontra\\xad\\ndictions of its own, andWilsonian, politics.

While\\nthere were pressures - in the national economy andin the cities \\xad\\nfor areduced emphasis onregional policy, there was a growing\\nregional problem. Inthiscontext, stimulus forindigenous employ\\xad\\nment,however unlikely to succeed, was one ofthe few options\\navailable .Itwas also encouraged by achange,alreadymentioned,\\nin thenatureofregional politics themselves. Inthecontextofclaims\\nfordevolution inScotland and Wales the high degree ofexternal\\nownership, inpartitselfa result ofregional policy,becamean\\nincreasingly important component ofthepoliticsofregionalism\\n(see, for an earlyexample, Firn,1973).The Communist Partyin the\\nnorth-west (Communist Party,undated), theLabour Partyin\\nScotland (Labour Party, 1977), the Welsh and Scottish Nationalist\\nParties,andotherorganisations in \\'the regions\\' raised this as a\\nmajorissueofcomplaint. Inthecontextofthese shifts the Welsh\\nandScottish Development Agencies were established . They were\\nthus both political andeconomic responses, andtheirbrieffocused,\\nmorethanhadtheprevious formofregional policy, on the\\ngeneration ofinternal growth. The lack ofa basis for such a\\nstrategy wasapparent, however,andin fact all the regional IDAs\\nspentmoretimecontinuing the policy oftryingtoattractnew\\ninvestment, frequently inacrimonious competition with each other,\\nthanon\\'stimulating theexisting localeconomy\\'. Symbolically\\nperhaps, thegovernment finally went downon thedevolution issue.\\nMonetarism\\nTheelectionof1979markedabreakfrom the ever-shifting termsof\\nthepost-war consensus .Manyoftheactualeconomic policiesofthe\\nnewThatcher government - theso-called newmonetarism - were in\\nfact not new. A concernaboutthepublic-sector borrowing require\\xad\\nment, the political formulation oftheeconomic situation as being 256SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nprimarily aproblemofinflation, and cuts in public expenditure all\\nhad their precursors underthe previous Labourgovernment.\\nBut in political terms the victory oftheConservatives in 1979did\\nmark a shift. The adventofMargaret Thatcher as Prime Minister\\nheralded adeparture ,particularly inrhetorical and ideological\\nterms, from the post-war social-democratic tradition so manifestly\\nindisarray. The failure ofthe policies ofprevious decades laid the\\nbasis for the victoryoftheright.Realdisenchantment with\\nundemocratic Stateintervention, brilliantly orchestrated in apopu\\xad\\nlist\\'individual freedom\\' campaign, agreement between Conserva\\xad\\ntives and the Labourrightthatpublicexpenditure was\\'toohigh\\'\\n(butwherethatexpenditure wasinextricably associated with the\\npoliciesofLabour) and years ofattempts to stem the growthof\\nwages(butapparently to no avail in terms of economic recovery)\\ntogether produced an election victory for a Conservative Party\\nnewly-dominated by its right wing. Itwas a right wing prepared to\\nbreak the old consensus, to break through the shifting stalemate\\nthatwent with it. Itwas thus a very different tradition within the\\nToryparty.Ithad more commitment tomarketideology - at home\\nnow, as wellas in international trade- than to the settled old terms\\nofclass rule. It could not have been furtherfrom the Conservative\\nPartywhich,nearlytwentyyearsbefore, hadestablished the\\nNational Economic Development Office. But to pursue this new\\nphilosophy meantsocialreconstruction , and for real, not justas\\npartoftherhetoric of the new vision. Whatwas now popularly\\nparaded as themonolith ofthetradeunionmovement had to be\\nshakenup and weakened. While it might not providemuch in the\\nway of its own visions of an alternative future it was still strong\\nenoughin defence to preventa way out of the crisis being found on\\notherterms. But such a course meantalso the reconstruction of\\nmanyotheraspectsofBritish social life, including theentrenched\\nandarchaicinstitutions oftheestablishment, peopled in large part\\nbymembers ofthe\\'old\\'Tory party.\\nIn many ways the terms ofdebateofthe \\'modernisation\\' period\\nofthe sixties were now reversed. This was not justin the most\\nobvious senses, from Welfare State and public sector to cutback\\nandprivatisation. TheattackonStateexpenditure and on public\\nintervention waspartlyenabled byre-working the distinction\\nbetween \\'productive\\' and \\'non-productive \\'partsoftheeconomy .\\nIn the sixties the productive sector was pre-eminently manufactur\\xad\\ning; services were relegated to second place and politicians in both Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 257\\nmajorparties, as well as managers inmajor(manufacturing)\\ncompanies, attacked the\\'speculators\\' oftheproperty boom as\\nparasitic andunproductive . A decade laterthedistinction had come\\nto meansomething completely different: it was the market(private)\\nsector which was productive, the public which was the parasitic\\ndead-weight. Both distinctions, in verydifferent ways, had clear\\ngeographical repercussions. Therewereothersuchcontrasts, too.\\nInsteadofArnoldWeinstock, efficientmanager ofbigcapital,the\\nlikes of Freddie Laker-paraded in the image offree-booting\\nentrepreneur - were held up for public approbation , the kind of\\nattitudethatwas needed if the British economy was to be rescued.\\nAlong with this went a parallel shift in relationtoprofessionals,\\nscientists and technologists . Clearly those in the Statesector no\\nlonger held the key to recovery. But it was more thanthat;the idea\\noftechnological advance through the research laboratories ofbig\\ncapital was superseded by thenotionofthe scientist as entrepre\\xad\\nneur. The periodsofmodernisation andofmonetarism were not\\njustdifferent because the wider economic situation hadchanged so\\ndramatically, because \\'therequirements ofaccumulation\\' were\\ndifferent; they were also dramatically contrasting in thedominant\\npolitical interpretations ofwhat those requirements were.\\nButThatcherism did not sweep the board.Itwas, again, an\\nelection victory with a definable social base and a clear geographi\\xad\\ncaldimension . Its core was in the growing white-collar and middle\\nstrataalongside, within capitalitself, those elements which identi\\xad\\nfied ideologically with an \\'entrepreneurial\\' label. The contrast with\\nthe sixties is again clear. Thus, in terms ofthe \\'sci-tech\\' brigade:\\n\\'TheWilsonian seizureofscience as the theme for the 1964election\\n. . .soughtto define and capturea newstratum-thatofscientists\\nandtechnologists - and to insist thattheir interests lay with Labour\\n... .

Almostcertainly, a high proportion ofthe\\nsamegroupvoted for Thatcher in 1979\\'(Rose and Rose, 1982).The\\nwhite-collar stratawere not to be disappointed, eitherideologically\\noreconomically (indistributional terms),but small business,\\nalthough approving ideologically, was soon to suffer ratherthan\\ngain in purely economic terms. Support from big manufacturing\\nindustry was always more reserved, and occasionally oscillated\\nquitedramatically, but a call early on by the head ofthe CBI for a\\n\\'bare-knuckle fight\\' was resisted. Party-political loyalties were hard\\nto break. In spite ofits patience being sorely tested, the CBI at its 258SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconference in 1982 foundithardto forget its long-term party\\nallegiance. Afternumerous boardroom battles, reported in the\\nPress,overpossible transfer ofsupport tothenewSocial\\nDemocrats, mostcompanies retained theirlonger-term political\\nand class loyalties abovemoreimmediate economic interests. And\\nthroughout, theInstitute ofDirectors gave the new strategy total\\nsupport.

Thetraditional Labourbase\\nseems to have held in the former. \\'The British working class\\nsometimes continue[sl to vote Labour afterthemostappalling\\nclobbering - as they did in 1950, andas they did to a greatextentin\\ntheNorthandScotland this time\\' (Price, 1979, p. 706).

Astudyof\\nthe election commented thatthe evidence for whatit called \\'class\\nde-alignment\\' wasmadeall the more remarkable by thesimulta\\xad\\nneousstrengthening of regional alignment (Penniman, 1981).\\nTheimplications ofall this are interesting. Itreinforces the\\nindications inChapters 4and5thatthere are increasing geogra\\xad\\nphical divisions within each ofthesebroadsocialgroups. The\\ndifferences within the managerial andscientific-technical groupsare\\nparticularly interesting. FromChapters 4and5 it is clear that\\nwithin these broadgroupssocialstatusandgeographical location\\nare related and,whatis more, thatthey may also be mutually\\xad\\nreinforcing . In 1979 the autonomous influence oftheregionally\\xad\\nbasedLabour alliances andstrength, discussed inChapter 5,\\ncontinued to hold up. In otherwords,thewithin-class biases\\ntowards Labour in these areas, not only among\\'lower middle\\nandworking\\'butalsoamong\\'middle\\' classes have been retained, if\\nnotreinforced, given the knownchanges goingon insocial\\nstructure. IIHere we see again,then, a\\'reverseeffect\\',ofregional\\nindividuality onnational political structures, ofthepossible\\nimportance of\\'spatial\\' characteristics in theformation of social\\ncharacteristics.\\n* * *In the first year afterthe election the geographical basis of the\\nGovernment wasmirrored in thecutbacks made in regional policy.\\nTherewere anumberofcontributory reasonsbehindthese cuts.\\nFirst,theinternational economic situation, combined with the\\neffectsoftheGovernment\\'s owneconomic strategy, sentmanufac\\xad\\nturingemployment into anunprecedented decline.That,together 260SpatialDivisions of\\'Labour\\nwith lower investment in newbuilding, left little opportunity for any\\nspatialredistribution .Second, thisGovernment had no political\\nalliancewith the unionsandnopolitical base inmostoftheregions\\nwhichstoodto gain from the existingpatternofregional incentives.\\nTherewastherefore nomajorpolitical pressure forregional policy.\\nThird,theGovernment wasproclaiming anideological commitment\\ntothemarket andtocutsinpublicexpenditure .Economic\\nconditions ,political baseandideological predisposition thusall\\nindicated at leastsome cuts inregional policy,andtheseindeedtook\\nplace.Thecutsthemselves, moreover ,indicated somechangein the\\nnatureandpotential roleofregional policy.Theydidnotsimply\\nmakeit evenmoreofameanstounderpin accumulation .The\\ncutbacks in theautomatic Regional Development Grantsprovoked\\noutright attackfrom the CBI which,although agreeing itwouldnot\\npushforlaboursubsidies orIDCs,declared thatit did\\'favour\\nregional assistance beingconcentrated oninvestment incentives\\' and\\nsupported factorybuilding andinfrastructure provision ,andcon\\xad\\nfirmedits\\'strongsupport for thecurrent Regional Development\\nGrantsystemas amechanism forassisting investment\\' (CBI, 1979).\\nOverall, itdeclared \\'theCBl\\'scontinued support for astrong\\nregional policybasedon positive incentives\\' (CBI,1979).Thedetail\\nofthis isinteresting.

How does\\nthis new conceptof\"freetrading\" tie up with Sir Keith Joseph\\'s\\nthinking?\\' If the Wilson government\\'s regional policy was partand\\nparcelofitsstrategyfornational economic growth,this exercise in\\nenterprise zoneswasintegral to theThatcher government\\'s\\nproclamation ofa new politics. Indeed, it may well turnout to be\\ntheirmajorimpact(Anderson, 1983;LabourParty,1980; Massey,\\n1982). Even the changed conception of scientists and technologists\\nwas reflected in employment policy. \\'Science parks\\'sprangup in the\\nhopethatthe geniuses ofthe local academic institutions mightturn\\ntheirtalentsin anentrepreneurial direction, make money outof\\ntheirPhDs,and the link between academic science and the pursuit\\nofprofitbestrengthened. Finally, one arm ofregional policy was\\nabandoned entirely. This government, whose avowed aim ofsocial\\nreconstruction included, indeed necessitated, themodernisation of\\nmanyinstitutions of\\'theBritishestablishment\\', gave way before the\\nsocial power ofhigher-level civil servants and agreed to abandon\\nplans to decentralise to\\'theregions\\' offices ofthecentralState.\\nRegional, and more generally spatial,aspects of policy continued\\ntheirdownward slide inimportance while at the same time their\\nnatureand role shifted yet again.\\nMoreover, thiscutbackin regional policy came at a time when\\notherelements in the national strategy werehittingthe declining\\nperipheral regionsparticularly hard. Thecutbacks in thenationa\\xad\\nlisedindustries, especially steel and coal, had a regionalised impact,\\nas did public expenditure cuts. Local authority employment was\\noneofthe fewpartsof thejob-structure notoperating, in income\\nandskillterms,dramatically against theperipheral regions\\n(Chapter 4).Cutbacks weretherefore inthatsenseboundto have\\nthe effect of increasing regionalinequality. Thesituation was worse\\nthanthis,however, for in spite ofthe losses ofjobsin the\\nnationalised industries, regions such as Wales, the north-east and\\nScotland remained the most dependent in thecountry onState\\nactivityofsome sort, whether inexpenditure percapita(where\\nNorthern Irelandand then Wales toppedthe list), or in terms of\\njobs. On the latter,thedependence ofpeople in these regions on the\\npublicsectorfor relatively wellpaid white-collar jobsincreased over\\nthe 1970s, and this was especially true for women (Kirwan, 1981).\\nIn these regions virtually the only source ofhigher-paid and/or\\nprofessional employment which is available to women is the public Class.

Rumours of\\'socialunrest\\'andthreatsofactionseem\\nto have slowed for a while the eventualIy dramatic cutsatLlanwern\\nandPortTalbot; and it was the lead by the Welsh miners which\\nforced the government to back offin early 1981on itsfinancial\\nstringency with the NCB. Later, there was political reluctance to\\nclose the Ravenscraig steelworks inScotland ,partofBSe\\'splanned\\ncutback. But overall the attempt to cut back on welfare provision\\nand the public sectorgenerally wasregionalised in itsimpact.\\nMoreover there was little prospect, as there had been in the\\nsixties,thatthese losses wouldbereplaced byjobsinother\\nindustries. Regional policy had been cut back,andanyway the\\neconomic conditions for itsoperation were by now far less\\npropitious , whilepublicexpenditure cutsremoved thatelementof\\ntheearlierperiod\\'squid pro quo. Finallythedeepening international\\nrecession, combined with the government\\'s commitment to policies\\nwhich led to high interestrates and high levels ofexchange for\\nsterling,provoked severecutbacks in manyoftheindustries which\\nhaddecentralised in the sixties and seventies.l? Unemployment in\\ntheDevelopment Areas rose dramatically. By late 1982 the ratein\\nNorthern Irelandwas 20 per cent, in theNorthandWales over 16\\npercentand inScotland over 14 per cent. The \\'regional issue\\'\\nbecame once againa focusofdiscontent.\\nBut this time it was notjustthetraditional regional-problem\\nregions which saw majorlossesofjobs. Theimpactofthe recession\\nwas very general; even the service industries were losing employ\\xad\\nment.

The rate ofunemployment in each ofthese two\\nregionswas soon abovethatforScotland . By the end of1982, the\\nfigures were over 15 per cent in boththe west midlands andthe\\nnorth-west. Inwhatwasdubbed\\'thefirstcombined statement ofits\\nkind\\' the chairpersons oftheCBI\\'swestmidlands ,north-west , and\\nYorkshire andHumberside regions issued a sterndemand for relief\\nfor industry (Garnett , 1982).

Ifone thing is clear\\nfrom theforegoing chapters it is that these characteristics ofBritish\\ncapital are also offundamental importance for the national geogra\\xad\\nphy.The geography of accumulation in these two different partsof\\ncapitalin theUnitedKingdom is quite \" distinct, and it is the\\ngeography of internationally-orientated capital which is increas\\xad\\ninglydominant and which lies behind the emerging spatial division\\noflabourand thestructure of spatial inequality.\\nIn this section we are concerned with the geography ofultimate\\ncontrolover the relations ofownership and possession. One thing is Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 265\\ncertain:thatcontrolisincreasingly exercised from the south-east of\\nEngland.However, theargument is morecomplicated thanitlooks\\nat first sight. The mostobvious fact isthattheheadquarters of\\nBritishinternational capitalis in the south-east , inandaround\\nLondon. This has been true ofbanking capitalforcenturies, andit\\nis trueofmostbig,internationalised Britishmanufacturing capital.\\nEach increase in the economic importance ofsuchcompanies brings\\nwith it also an increase in thespatialconcentration ofcontrolover\\ntherelations ofproduction andoveraccumulation. It wastrueof\\ntheemergence of newmanufacturing multinationals in the fifties.\\nThemergerboomof the late 1960sdid the same. While the aspatial\\nconcentration andcentralisation ofcapitalhasnotbrought in its\\ntrainspatialconcentration ofproduction activities, ithasbrought\\nwith itgeographical centralisation of therelationsofproduction, of\\ncontrolover the relations ofownership andpossession. Notonly\\ncentralisation but also concentration has had this effect. On the\\nwhole, the largerthecompany themorelikely it is to have a\\ndetached head office andthemorelikely it is thatthatoffice will be\\nin thesouth-east region. On the whole, therefore, it islargercapital\\nwhich is centralising theownership ofitsproduction inthatregion.\\nBut theformalcriterion ofabsolute sizealoneis not sufficient.\\nForone thing, a numberofvery large UK companies do havetheir\\nheadquarters \\'intheregions\\'.Whatisinteresting iswhich\\ncompanies theyare.AsCrumandGudgin (1977)pointout,they\\ntend to be companies which are confined to onebroadproduct-area\\nand which are based within a region where there is a historical\\nspecialisation withinthatproduct-area .Thus\\'Tootalremains in\\nManchester.l \\'Pilkington Bros. in St. Helens, CoatsPatonsin\\nGlasgow, Distillers inEdinburgh, andJosephLucasandTube\\nInvestments inBirmingham\\' (p. 113). Certainly thesecompanies are\\nhuge -andinternationalised -butCrumandGudginarerightto\\npointto their relatively confined productbases.\"Itissomething of\\nwhatwasreferred to inChapter 2 as aproduction ratherthana\\nfinancial orientation .Theremay, then, thoughthis needs further\\ninvestigation, bedifferences in type of company , in the social nature\\nofcapital, even within major,internationally-orientated capital,\\nbetween thatwhichcongregates inLondon andthesouthandeast\\nandthatwhich has moretendency toremainin itstraditional and\\nmoreperipheral fastnesses. Nonethe less it is truethatthe bulk of\\nlarge,internationalised Britishcapitalhas itsheadquarters in the\\nsouthand east ofEngland. 266SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\n\\'Modernising\\' the British economy in the sense understood in the\\n1960shadcontradictory effects, notonlyinthatthe newly\\xad\\nstrengthened international companies wentoffandinvested abroad\\n(whichitselfhadgeographical effects- ifonlyimplicit - in\\nremoving existingorpotential investment in thenational economy\\n- Singh, 1975) butalso inthatitreinforced thisspatialconcentra\\xad\\ntionofcontrolovertherelations ofproduction .

They are not overwhelmingly concerned with\\nexpansion , theessential ingredient ofcapitalist accumulation . They\\nretain, inotherwords,manyofthebehavioural characteristics of\\nthe classical pettybourgeoisie. InWright\\'s framework ,presented in\\nChapter 2, there is a dimension ofcontradictory locations between\\npettybourgeoisie andbourgeoisie. Itis aclassification adopted by\\nWrightonly for extremely small firms - he gives a range ofupper\\nlimitsofemployment, from ten to fifty employees. Thisis a\\ndefinition based, like the distinction between working classand\\ncapital, on the natureof theunderlying socialrelations ofvalue\\xad\\nproduction :\\'Whenapetty-bourgeois producer employs a single\\nhelper, there is an immediate changein the social relations of\\nproduction, for thelabourofaworkercan now be exploited . Still,\\nthesurplus-value appropriated from a single employee is likely to\\nbeverysmall\\' (p. 35). As thenumber ofemployees increases,\\nhowever, the proportion ofsurplusproduct generated assurplus\\nvalue by workers increases, andtheproportion generated by the\\nowner(andtheunpaidlabourofher/hisfamily) declines. \\'At some\\npoint[the latter] becomes less thanhalfofthetotalsurplusproduct,\\nandeventually becomes a small fractionofthetotalsurplus.Atthat\\npoint,thepetty-bourgeois producer becomes firmlyasmall\\ncapitalist\\' (pp.35-6). AsWrightsays, there is no a priori basis\\nfor saying how many employees turnsanemployer into acapitalist\\nin thoseterms.Itwilldependforinstanceontechnology, andit will\\nchangeover time. But whatis clear is that,on thiscriterion, the\\ncompanies being discussed here are plainly capitalist. The non\\xad\\naccumulative characteristics which they sharewith the classical\\npettybourgeoisie are the result ofsocialbehaviour ratherthanofan\\nunderlying structure ofvaluerelations.Itis notthatthispartof\\nproduction isconducted within the formal value relations ofpetty\\xad\\nbourgeois production. Itisthatin theUnitedKingdom asignificant 270SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsectionofcapitalconducts its business in a singularly undynamic ,\\neven\\'uncapitalist \\',fashion.\\nWhy is this important to theanalysishere? Because it is this kind\\nofcompany whichrepresents muchofwhatremains in theUnited\\nKingdom todayof\\'localcapita\\\\\\', much, in otherwords,ofwhat\\nremains inregionsotherthanthesouthandeastoflocally\\xad\\ncontrolled industry, andquitea bitofwhatis inthatregion too.\\nTheveryreasonsfor thesurvivalofsuchcompanies oftenexpress\\ntheircharacteristics. Threefactorsstandout from Boswell\\'s survey\\nofBritish firms ofup to 500 employees .Thefirst has been reliance\\noncheaplabour, in the case ofcottonand wool textiles usually\\nfemale, and oftenAsian.The lack ofregional policyincentives in\\nthehomeareasoftheseindustries, and the existinghigherfemale\\nactivityrates, may also have meantthattherewas less in-migrant\\ncompetition for such workers. In these cases the labourischeap\\nbecauseofits wider characteristics (sex, race) and the discrimina\\xad\\ntionassociated with them. In otherpartsofthe small- andmedium\\nfirmsectorthis kind oflabouris notemployed butthe\\'smallfirm\\nsector\\'as a whole is notorious for its low degree ofunionisation\\nand low pay, in parta result ofthenatureofthecompanies\\nthemselves and thedifficulties oforganising withinthem. Second, in\\nsomeindustries, andparticularl ycottonand wool textiles (Boswell,\\n1973)andfootwear (Mounfield, UnwinandGuy, 1982) geographi\\xad\\ncalcharacteristics themselve smayhavebeen significant. The\\nfrequent locationofplantsin these industries inisolated commu\\xad\\nnitieswherelabourhashadlittlebargaining power(Boswell,\\np. 115) has been a factorinkeeping wagesdown, while the\\ncoincidence within a very local geographical areaofthe whole\\npackageofworkforce ,management andownership (thelattertwo\\noftenthe same) has seemed to providesomesortoffocus for a\\ncommon frontbetween workers andowners,theonein defence of\\ntheirjobs,theotherindefenceoftheircompanies. (Itis not being\\nsuggested that\\'geography\\' itselfhas anecessary effect here. The\\nminingvillagesdiscussed inChapter 5 were very similarintheir\\npurelydescriptive spatialaspects, yettheirhistoryisofmuch\\ngreaterconflict.Itis thecombination ofthisparticular kindof\\ncapitalandaparticular segment ofthelabourforce [in this case\\nmainlywomen] - in otherwordsofaparticular setofsocial relations\\nin aparticular geographical structure -which is significant [seeUrry,\\n1980].) But the shifts which we have analysed inothersectionsof\\ncapitalseem likely to threaten bothofthese \\'advantages\\'. On the Class.

Inotherwords,the new geography of\\nproduction (asopposed tocontrol) insomesections ofbigcapital\\nmay welI pose a threatto thesurvivalofsomeoftheseremaining\\nstrongholds oflocalownership.\\nThethird,andthemain,factorin thesurvivalofthis typeoffirm\\nissimplerigidity- the very fact thattheownereithercannot, or\\nsimplydoesnotwantto,transfereithertheinvested cash,or him or\\nherselftoanother, morelucrative, sectorofproduction (Boswell,\\n1973).Thisisnotthe flexible capitalofbigintersectoral companies,\\nsearching formaximum profit.It iscommitment to the family\\nbusiness. It isnotthedynamism andentrepreneurship invoked in\\nmuchpolitical rhetoric aboutsmalIcompanies. Infact, as in the\\ncasesdescribed here, it has oftenbeen the very lack ofadriveto\\naccumulate which has preserved smalIandmedium-sized firms in\\nsuch large numbers. It isnotthensurprising thatoverandover\\nagainarea-based analyses pointto the fact thatlocalownership is\\nconcentrated inslower-growing sectors.\\nItisperhaps worthnotingthatmuchthesamegeneralpoint(the\\nlackofabilityto form a new independent dynamic ofaccumulation)\\nappliestootherkindsofsmallandmedium capitalevenwhereit is\\nnotofthis very traditional character. Thusinmanysectorssuch\\nfirmsarecompletely dependent onthedynamic ofthelarge\\ncompanies which they serve. Theform may vary: from sma11firms\\nproducing consumer goods,which are oftentied to,ordominated by,\\nmajorretailoutlets(see thediscussion ofclothing inChapter 4) to\\ncomponent manufacturers , as in the carindustry. But inmostcases,\\nalthough the small firms may be significant asemployers, andmay\\neven be, immediately, \\'responsible\\' for the creation ofnumerous\\njobs,theirposition in the overal1 structure oftheeconomy means\\nthatthe realdynamic ofaccumulation lieselsewhere, with the large\\ncapitalofthe retail companies or the big carfirms.\\nThereare,however, somesmal1companies which do have those\\nmuch-referred-to characteristics -entrepreneurship, growth-poten\\xad\\ntialandenterprise. Such firms exist, as we have seen, in electronics,\\nininstrument engineering, inproducer services.Theyarenot 272 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nalways, by any means, independent ofbig firms, but they may be\\nreal foci ofgrowth. They tend to be notonly small, but relatively\\nnew. They are also, in most cases, internationally-oriented. What\\ncharacterises themgeographically is theirconcentration inthat\\n\\'sunbelt\\'stretchfrom East Anglia to Southampton and Bristol. Not\\nonly are the sectors in which they are most frequent located mainly\\nin thesouth-east (see the examples in Chapter 4), but so is that\\nstratumofthepopulation which has the highest propensity tostart\\nnew firms - graduates , and those with otherformsofhigher\\neducation (Gudgin, Brunskill and Fothergill, 1979). This is much\\nthe same kind ofduality,then, as in self-employment in services,\\nwith the old and declining elements hangingon in varying degrees\\nover the countryas a whole but with the new and growing parts,\\nwith high statusand high income, being overwhelmingly concen\\xad\\ntratedin thesouth-east, plus a recent tendency to migrate to\\nneighbouring regions.!\" When one considers the factors which lie\\nbehindboththe easeofstartingup new firms and the potential for\\nsuccess, this regional distribution isunderstandable .Storey\\'s(1982)\\nresearch indicates two main conditions underlying thepropensity to\\nstartup new businesses: previous and dominant industry, and\\nfinance - particularly personal savings and second mortgages . We\\nhavealreadynotedhow the industrial structure ofthe heavy\\xad\\nindustry Development Areas worked againstnew-firm indigenous\\ngrowth(Chapter 5). Incontrast, thedistributions ofpersonal\\nsavings, ofowner-occupation andofhigh house prices are all\\nbiasedtowards thecentralregions. The background reasons for\\nsuccess - previous management experience, educational level and\\nlocalmarkets -pushin the same direction. Ofall the new\\ncompanies established in 1980, 35 per cent were based in the\\nsouth-east (Department ofIndustry). It does seem indisputable\\nthat, were there ever to be a \\'small-firm strategy\\' whichactually\\nworkedbut which was undifferentiated spatially, it would provide\\nmost benefit in employment terms to the southand eastofEngland\\n(Storey, 1982).The real social and economic distinctions which exist\\nwithinboththe small-firm and self-employment sectionsofthe\\neconomy are thus important spatially. Notonly do the distinct\\nelements have different geographical distributions, they also have\\ndifferent implications for future growth.\\nSo it is not justthatthegeography ofownership is increasingly\\nconcentrated in thesouthand east. The contrasts indynamism\\nbetween the different partsofcapital,together with their different Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 273\\ngeographical distributions, meansthatcontroloveraccumulation is\\neven more concentrated inthatcornerofthecountrythanisformal\\nownership . Thispictureis massively re inforced when we bringback\\ninto the picturebanking capital,stilloperating to a large extent\\nfrom its old home -basein the City ofLondon, andfrom here\\ncontrolling notjustthe financial sectoritselfbut also, to varying\\ndegrees, otherpartsof theeconomy. Inavarietyofways, then,\\nspatialcentralisation of realcontroloverproduction , over the\\nprocessofaccumulation, isoccurring to anextentfargreaterthan\\nthatwhichwouldbeindicated bythesimpletallying-up of\\nheadquarters, weighted, say, by employment. Forit is precisely in\\nthosepartsoftheeconomy which lead the process ofaccumulation\\nthatthesouthand east is increasingly important as thelocationof\\ncontrol.Incounterposition to this, the rest ofthecountryissubject\\ntoexternal control(thatis, the more strategic functions in the\\noverallrelations ofownership andpossession areabsent)to a\\ndegreegreaterthanisevidentin the figures for legal ownership.\\nThe divisions within,andcharacteristics of, Britishcapitalwhich\\nareimportantto aneconomic andpolitical analysisoftheUnited\\nKingdom andits rise anddeclineas acapitalist power,are\\nfundamental also to its industrial geography .Conversely thebroad\\ndivisions oftheeconomy which are appropriate to ageographical\\nanalysisreflect fhat long economic andpolitical history. The whole\\nstructure isdominatedbyrelatively dynamic andinternationally\\xad\\norientated financial and industrial companies (andmuchofthe\\naccumulation which is controlled from the southand east is, of\\ncourse,abroad- not in the UnitedKingdom at all). The \\'restof\\nBritishindustry\\' is very much whatremains, in terms ofgeogra\\xad\\nphically-local control, in\\'therestofBritain\\'.And,ofcourse, the\\nnational geography is alsomarkedbythelong-lingering inheritance\\nofEmpire andofcommitment to aninternational role.The\\nimportance ofinternationally-orientated capitalis oneaspectof\\nthis but in otherways too British industrial geography bears the\\nmarksof thenational role ofmorethanacenturyago,justasmuch\\nas do the economy andthe class structure . While in the Develop\\xad\\nment Areas the decline ofthe old production-bases ofEmpire\\ncontinues tocreatepovertyandunemployment , thefinancial sideof\\ntheinternational role, based in the south-east ,continues to flourish.\\n* * *So far we have lookedonly at a very broadsketch,andconsidered\\nonlythedistribution ofownership. Looking belowthat,and 274SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconsidering also wider questions ofspatialorganisation, the geo\\xad\\ngraphyofdirectproduction, there is a more complex picture.There\\naresubdivisions .withineachofthemajorgroups.Withinbig\\nindustrial capitalinthedynamic partsoftheeconomy, for\\ninstance, electronics majorsare not like chemical giants, nor yet\\nagain like multinational clothing companies . Here,technology and\\nlabourprocess in particular areimportant, thoughnot on their own\\na defining characteristic . The great differences in spatialstructure\\nare related to contrasts inlabourprocess, to the long-term natureof\\ntechnological development, and to the related social patternsofthe\\nworkforce.\\nThere are also clear divides within thatgroupofmiddle-sized and\\nsmallcompanies stiIlattempting to tick over quietly in the regions\\nwhere they have long been based. I?First,there are the small-scale\\nfirms involved in the production ofbasic goods and means of\\nproduction : the firms which turn out nuts, bolts, fasteners, iron\\xad\\ncastings, small-batch-production machine tools and so on. They\\ntend to have heavy, non-standardised labourprocesses in terms of\\nthe work involved and, overwhelmingly, they employ men. The\\ndominant unions are the AUEWand theTGWU. Thecompanies\\narelocated,geographically, largely in the heartlands ofmanufactur\\xad\\ningindustry, the west midlands mostobviously, but also in other\\nareas. The marketis often local, the companies are often deeply\\nintegrated into their regional economies, and often dependent on\\none or two ofthe larger producers in those economies .Thereis\\nincreasing international tradein some ofthese goods, and some\\nfirms in these industries are beginning to feel the impactofforeign\\ncompetition , but most of all these firms are suffering from the\\ngeneralrundown of the British economy and in particular its\\nmanufacturing sector. Because oftheir place in the economy, they\\narevictimsofdeindustrialisation as well as partof it.Theirappeal\\nfor aid is often in terms ofbeing vital to recovery, to argue that\\ntheirdisappearance wouldhinderanynational economic recon\\xad\\nstruction . The machine tool industrywas the focus of this attention\\nin the 1960s and a whole series of othershave followed. Inlate\\n1982, the fastener industry representatives (the British Industrial\\nFasteners\\' Federation) arguedthattheirs was a strategic sector. A\\nnumberoftheindustries hazeundergone co-ordinated rundown ;\\ntheir decline isan element in the general decline ofskilled and semi\\xad\\nskilledmanualjobsfor men in manufacturing . Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 275\\nIncomplete contrast isthatgroupofcompanies engaged in the\\nproduction ofwhatmight be called old-fashioned consumer goods\\nandrelatedindustries -clothing, textiles, footwear, cutleryand\\nhosiery. Because of their different place in the economy ,andalso in\\nmanycases the greatertransportability oftheirproducts, these\\nindustries are not so much threatened by thedeindustrialisation of\\nBritain,they are one of the mostdramatic elementsofit.Production\\nintheUnitedKingdom in theseindustries isunderseverethreatin the\\ncontextdirectlyofthechanging international divisionoflabour.The\\ndeclinein these industries leads the declineofothers.Textile\\nmachinery has been a recent victim. Intheseindustries the claim on\\ntheStateis usually in terms ofdemands forimportcontrols.In\\nfurthercontrast to thenuts-and-bolts group,thispartoftheeconomy\\nhashistorically employed a muchmoreimportant elementof female\\nlabour.This isparticularly true of the c1othing-footwear-hosiery\\ngroup.Others,though,such ascutlery,have been sourcesmainlyof\\njobsfor men. Again in contrast with the big cross-sector unions\\ntypicalofthemeans-of-production industries, manyofthesesectors\\nhaveindustry-specific unions;as wesaw in Chapter4, inclothingand\\nfootwear there was anxiety on the partofmanagement to keep it that\\nway.Historically ,these industries pre-date theIndustrial Revolution,\\ntheirproducts are basic consumer goods,andtheirproduction in the\\nUnitedKingdom hasoftenslowly evolved througha seriesofstages\\ntofully-capitalistandfactory production.Theirgeograph y is\\ndifferent, too, from the nuts-and -boltsindustries. Interestingly , for\\nthese are consumer-goods industries, they areprobably lessmarket\\xad\\norientated. Asurprisingnumberofthem have developed over the last\\ncoupleofcenturies veryparticular localandregional bases - as we\\nsaw in the case offootwear inChapter 4. Andmanyofthemedium\\xad\\nsized and smaller companies are still there.\\n* * *Economic, socialandgeographical contrasts within\\'Britishcapital\\'\\nareintegrally boundup with each other.Thesearejusta few\\nexamples. Whatthey show is thateachofthe\\'criteria\\' discussed\\ninChapter 2 isimportant: theirsignificance has been seen a number\\noftimes in the foregoing chapters. Atdifferent pointsandin\\ndifferent ways they cross-cut andareinterwoven with each other\\nand inthatguise are partoftheanalysis ofthecomplex, and\\nparticular, pictureofthe social economy andgeography ofBritish\\ncapital. 276SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nWhite-collar hierarchies\\nThecentralisation ofcontrolover relations ofeconomic ownership\\nandofpossession in the south-east feeds down through manage\\xad\\nmenthierarchies to sitesofproduction throughout thecountry.\\nThrough thespatialextension of these relations ofproduction a\\nvarietyof\\'interregional relations\\' ofcontrolisestablished. Different\\nplaces in these tentacular forms of organisation are occupied by\\ndifferent kinds and levels ofmanagement, and thisstructure in turn\\nis related to social differentiation . The higher the social status, the\\nmore likely to be in the south-east ; thefurtherremoved from direct\\nproduction in afunctional sense, the furtherremoved also in many\\ncases in a spatialsense. In terms oftheframework ofsocial\\nstructure discussed in Chapter 2, this is the dimension between\\nbourgeoisie (which includes a fair slice oftopmanagement) and\\nworkingclass. And we have seen from the studies in Chapters 4 and\\n5 how increasingly in a numberofimportant partsofthe British\\neconomy thisdimension ofsocialstructure has adefinite and\\nsystematic geographical form.\\nWe have seen also thatmuch the same is true ofthespectrum of\\nproduction engineers, technicians, technologists and scientists. Both\\nbetween different kindsofproduction andwithinparticular\\nsegments oftheeconomy there is a developing relationbetween\\nsocialposition andspatiallocation. Industries in which \\'scientific\\ninput\\'came from engineers in the old sense, highly qualified but\\nwith a close relationtoproduction, bothfunctionally and geogra\\xad\\nphically, are becoming proportionately lessimportant. The old\\n\\'engineering universities\\' were in the regionsofengineering\\nproduction. We saw in Chapter 4 some elements ofthe decline of\\ntheindustrial-social structure which has been going on at least since\\nthe fifties (with the introduction into old firms ofelectronics-based\\nscientists), but the precipitate collapseofengineering and engineer\\xad\\ning-related industries since the late seventies has accelerated the\\nprocess. In contrast, industries where there is a far longer and more\\nhighly-differentiated division oflabouron thetechnical and\\nscientific side, and where the upperechelons ofthathierarchy\\nmay be quite removed in an immediate functional sense from direct\\nproduction have grown in relative importance, and grew in absolute\\nterms very strongly in the sixties and partsofthe seventies. Once\\nagain,functional distance fromproduction has often gone along\\nwithgeographical distance. In terms ofthe social framework Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 277\\nintroduced inChapter 2 thisspectrum ofpeople is best charac\\xad\\nterised along the dimension between petty bourgeoisie andworking\\nclass, and as the social statusgets\\'higher\\'(greater degreesof\\nautonomy ,greaterdistance from the working class) so does the\\nlikelihood oflivingin the southand eastofEngland. It isironic that\\nthe long-time calls for a raising ofthe lowstatusof\\'engineers\\', a\\nlowstatuswhich itself was partand parcel of the low statusin\\ngeneralaccorded toproduction within the social structure of\\nBritain, have only found an answer with the functional distancing\\nof engineering, in the scientific sense, from production. In this\\naspectofindustry as inmanagement thedevelopment ofthe\\ndivisionoflabourhas extended the range ofsocialstratainvolved\\nand increased their social separation. Ithas also increased their\\ngeographical separation.\\nThere is, as we have seen, some difference in Britain between the\\ngeography ofhigher-status scientists and technologists on the one\\nhandandofhighermanagerial groupson theother.It is a\\ndifference, again, which reflects their contrasting functions within\\nthe overall relations ofproduction. Management is moreconurba\\xad\\ntion-oriented , and specifically London-based. Research and devel\\xad\\nopmentstaffcan more often be found in the comparative seclusion\\nof asecondhand country mansion somewhere in the crescent of\\ncountrystretching from Bristol through the Home Counties and\\nintoEastAnglia-the\\'Britishsunbelt\\'.Itisthislatterdistribution\\ninparticular which is sharedwith the new entrepreneurs, the\\ndynamic endofthe small-firm sector. Itisaroundthesegroups\\nthatthe\\'sunbelt\\' has developed. To the extent thatthere has been\\nanysignificant movement inrecentyears, it has been the\\ndecentralisation ofheadquarters, andtherefore ofuppermanage\\xad\\nment to the area. Financial companies moving lock, stock and\\nbarrel from London to Bristol, for instance. Such shifts reinforce\\nboth the decline ofLondon as a centre ofemployment and the\\ndominance and social character ofthe sunbelt. Finally, this general\\npattern,oftheconcentration ofhigh-status jobsin this crescent of\\ncountry, isstimulated and reinforced by the geographical structure\\nofcertainelements ofStateemployment. This is, as we saw in\\nChapter4,particularly trueofthe central State. Local State sectors\\nare oneofthe few sources of professional jobsin\\'theregions\\', and\\nthis is true particularly for women.\\nSouthern and eastern stretches ofEngland, then, are home to a\\nvarietyofdifferent elements ofthe higher reaches ofwhite-collar 278 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nstrata.Theincreasing importance ofeach over the long term reflects\\nanumberofhistorical developments within British capitalism : the\\nconcentration ofownership, thechanging division oflabourin\\nsociety as a whole, the increasing divorcebetween mental and\\nmanual labourinproduction, andthegrowthoftheState\\napparatus .Thegroupincludes thetopendofmanagement\\nhierarchies ofmultiregional firms, the morerarified partsof\\nresearch and development in science-based industries, the profes\\xad\\nsionalsof thegrowing service sectors, the City, the upper-level civil\\nservants of thecentralState,the centres ofthe oldprofessions , and\\nthegraduate entrepreneurs .Performing different functions within\\nsociety as a whole, they nonetheless sharemuch in common\\nsocially. This is not, of course, the only partofthecountry in\\nwhich such people are to be found. In earlierchapters we have\\nnoted\\'research outliers\\', innorthern Cheshire forinstance and\\naroundEdinburgh, andthere are the more environmentally minded\\nelements of small-business entrepreneurship which have taken up\\nresidence in places such as Cornwall. But as a generalisation ofthe\\noverallpattern, thisbroadpictureis not unfair.\\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 anumberofthedetailed reasons\\nwhich lie behind this pattern,both the fact ofconcentration and its\\nlocation in thesouthand east. Reasons ofcontactand linkage,\\nordering patterns, thecommunity ofscientists, the community of\\nclass, the functioning oflabourmarkets, and social and residential\\npreferences . Over the longerspan ofhistorythepatternhas much to\\ndo,ofcourse, simply with the fact thatLondon is thecapitaland\\nthattheStateand all its centraldemands in terms ofgoods and\\nservices emanated from there. Itwas from here too thatthe\\nfinancial sectorplayed such a partinorganising international\\ntrade.Onceestablished, such acentrecangenerate its own\\nmomentum. Over the last halfcenturythelocationofthecentral\\nStatehas been very important to theelectronics industry, for\\ninstance, muchofwhichdeveloped through, andoften still is\\nclosely related to, the militaryand defence establishment.\\nSo the fact thattheheadquarters ofStateand Empire have been\\nin thesouth-east has been an important starter-motor for this\\nprocess of concentration . And we have seen thateven the most iron\\nofprimeministers failed to move them. But why notmove the\\nForeign Office, say, or the Ministry of Defence, to Longbenton ,\\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne? The clerical jobsin social security were\\ndecentralised there.Thereare of course many reasons of\\'linkage\\' Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 279\\nand\\'contact\\' which might militateagainstsuch a move, or call for\\nsomethoughtful reorganisation. But there are otherreasons, too,\\nand most of them revolve aroundsocial power.\\nBetween them, indeed, the upperechelons ofthesewhite-collar\\nsocialstratamore or less \\'control\\' thegeography ofemployment in\\nBritain. This is obvious in a simple way ofmanagement in the\\nlarger firms - they make the \\'location decisions\\' - and they do so, as\\nwe have argued,in thecontextofwidereconomic conditions . But\\nthere is also an element, as we have seen, of more purely social\\npower. The spatialimmobility ofupper-echelon civilservantsispart\\nof this, and so is whatseems to be the presently -increasing social\\nandspatialpoweroftheupperend of the spectrum oftechnologists\\nand scientists. Ever since the end of the Second WorldWar this\\ngrouphas been centrally important botheconomically and\\npolitically. Scientists and technologists emerged from the war and\\nintoreconstruction with greatly enhanced prestige: \\'thesense of\\nelitestatuswhich derived from membership ofthe new technolo\\xad\\ngical club, played no small partin the decision of manyconcerns to\\ninvest in development laboratories\\' (BurnsandStalker, 1961,\\np. 43). The defence programme reinforced thatposition. In the\\nsixties, as we have seen, science and technology wereregarded as\\nthecentralelements in modernising andtherebyrescuing the British\\neconomy. At thatpointit wasprimarily scientists in the labora\\xad\\ntories of large companies who were the focus ofattention and the\\nlocational form in which they were embedded was often the kind of\\nhierarchical structure described inChapter 4 forelectronics. By the\\nlate seventies and early eighties it was the scientist-as-entrepreneur\\nwho held centrestage and the terms of the locational emphasis had\\nshifted to things such as science parks. Some individuals moved\\nbetween groups. In the later period there were management buy\\xad\\noutsand various company-promoted schemesofgoing solo, where\\nformer employees turnedthemselves into self-employed subcon\\xad\\ntractors. Butwhatever thenatureoftheireconomic or ideological\\nsignificance it carriedwith itlocational power. Such people have\\nconsiderable freedom to decide where they want to work.

Indeed, one ofthecentralstakesat issue for the\\nwhole of this period has been the shape, organisation andstrength\\noflabour.\\'Geography \\', as we have seen, has not merely reflected\\nthatbattle; it has been one ofthe cards in the game.\\nOver and above everything else which has happened since the\\n1960s has been the erosion ofsomeofthecentralbastions of\\nworking-class trade union strength, the oldheartlands ofthelabour\\nmovement. The old sectoral union bases, in mining for instance,\\nhavecontinued , and often accelerated, their steep numerical decline,\\nandwhatthathasthreatened totakewith it has been the\\ngeographical coresoflabourism . There have been otherequally\\ndistinctive and equally majorlosses: the result ofdeindustrialisa\\xad\\ntion.Ithas been the cities and the midlands and the north-west\\nwhich have been most caughtup in this decline, and general and\\ncraft,rather\\'than sectoral, unions; unions like Ute TOWUand the\\nAUEW.Ithas been partoftherecomposition oftheworking class\\naway from male manualworkers.

The \\'sunbelt\\' was not empty before the\\narrivalofthe middle class. Deindustrialisation has also humbled\\neven the more-recently developed centresofmilitancy .The\\ndevastation of Merseyside, including theattackon the car industry\\nthere, is the most obvious example. There are many otherpartsof\\nthe economy losing jobs(the fall in employment for women in\\nindustries such as clothing has been massive), but in terms ofthat\\nold defensive strengthandstraightforward economic militancy, the\\nonesjustlisted are probably the most crucial losses. Whatstands\\nout is how much has gone. This is not a simple rerunof the 1930s:\\nthis time the concatenation of events is takingwith it not one but\\ntwo or three generations ofunionstrength. 282SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nWithin the working class also, the geography offunctions, of\\nindividual jobcontrol,ofautonomy, ischanging . This is particu\\xad\\nlarly evident in the decline of skilled manualjobs.We saw in\\nChapter 5 how the old skills and customs of individual jobcontrol\\nhaveactuallyprovedproblematical toindustries newly-arriving in\\nperipheral regions, employing redundant miners but having no\\ndemandfor such humanassets. The skills ofwhich such jobshave\\nbeenshornareconcentrated inotherpartsofthecountry.The same\\nis true too of a significant proportion ofthe newjobsfor women in\\nthese regions. In regions such as these, the old coalfields, a curious\\ndoubleandcontradictory process is underway. At the same time\\nand by the same process as local cohesiveness within the workforce\\nhas been undermined, by an increase in the variety ofindustries,\\nemployers, and so on, so the monofunctionality ofwork, and the\\nlack ofcontrolover the individual work-process, has increased.\\nFunctions and places within the relations ofproduction have been\\nseparated out,allocated todifferent socialgroups,andgeographi \\xad\\ncally removed.\\nAll these spatialchanges have been partand parcel ofthe shifting\\nnational composition oftheworking class. The periodas a whole\\nhas seen more thanjobloss and unemployment. Withinthat,as we\\nhave seen, there have also been majorchanges in skill and gender\\ncomposition .Increasing numbers ofwomen have been draftedinto\\nthelabourforce,public-sector andwhite-collar clericaljobshave,\\nover the periodas a whole, expanded ,non-manual jobshave\\nexpanded at the expense ofmanual, and older craft-related skills\\nhavecontinued to be diluted.\\nIt is,moreover, notjustthattherecomposition ofworking-class\\njobs,andofunemployment, has had a geographical form, it is also\\nthatgeographical form and spatialmobility has been integral to\\nrecomposition . Thecombination ofapreviously economically\\xad\\ninactive reserve and high unemployment ,together at times with\\nthechanging demands ofthedominant production processes, have\\nenabledcapitalwithin Britain to cut costs and increase its control\\nby shifting locationto lessorganised workers. At the same time, it\\nhas left unemployed those whose participation in theprevious\\ncentury\\'s patternofproduction enabled them to become stronger\\nand more organised .Whatincrease in employment there was for\\nworking-class peopleduringthis period on the whole avoidedthe\\nnewly-unemployed workforce ,bothin thecitiesandin the\\nDevelopment Areas, and instead soughtout new reserves oflabour Class.

It is certainly truethatboththe decline of\\nthe old and the form ofthe newcomposition andgeography of the\\nworking classpresentdifficulties to the construction ofacoherent\\nworkforce organisation . The solid old bastions, and some ofthe\\nnewer foci of militancy, havebeen weakened. Conditions in the\\ncities, the fact ofthatkindofgeographical environment, the density\\nofthe social network, the links between plants,the kinds of\\n(manufacturing) industry which were dominant, provided propi\\xad\\ntiousconditions forbuilding solidarity (Lane, 1982). Whatremains\\ntodayoftheprivatesectorin the cities - small firms and the service\\nsector- isnotoriously difficult to organise. Thescattering of more\\nisolatedplantsinsmallertowns, and in rural and semi-rural areas,\\nparticularly given the kind oflabourtheyemploy, seems to be a\\nmuch less helpful startingpoint.Indeed,we have seen thatspatial\\nisolation can at times be an explicit element of managerial location\\nstrategy. Onceagainsocialandspatialrecomposition ofthe\\nworkforce reinforce eachother.Putthistogether withthe\\nsocially-orientated location strategyofmanagements andtechni\\xad\\ncians and one gets a vision of a future geography ofindustry:\\nmanagement acting out its dreamsof a rural idyll, workforce\\nobligingly docile in widely-scattered factories, or clustered in smalI\\ngroupsontrading estates.

Also it is notthe case thatin allpartsofthe\\ncountrysuchcoherence is beingdismantled . In some regions- for\\nexample, Cornwall, thesouth-west moregenerally, EastAnglia- an\\nindustrial waged-labour-force ofanysize isonlyjustbeing\\nconstructed .

Multi-locational companies certainly increase the\\ndangerofdividing workers withincompanies, butthey also form\\na basis for different formsoforganisation -combines, forinstance\\n- and hold outsomepotential fornetworks oflinkages spanning\\nthecountry. Thelong-term growthofemployment inpublic-sector\\nservices holds outpossibilities bothoflinksbetween workers in\\ndifferent partsofthecountryandofconnections between employ\\xad\\nmentand service provision at amorelocalcommunity level.Itis\\nsometimes arguedthatthenewly-emerging geography ofemploy\\xad\\nmentis initselfessentially negative ground fortradeunion\\norganisation .Thecontrast isposedbetween highlyintegrated\\nindustrial cities and regions andruralisolation, individual labour\\nmarkets dominated byindividual plants(Lane,1982). But even\\nbetween these extremes the issue is not entirelyclear.Certainly in\\nthestudiesinearlierchapters (infootwear, forinstance,andthe\\nLancashire textileindustry) there have been cases in which such\\nlocality-structures have been one element in asituation more\\ngenerally inimical to organisation . But only one element. It was\\nthecombination ofparticular socialrelations in aparticular\\ngeographical structure which was really decisive. Theevidence\\nfromLockwood (1958), from Sayles (1958) and from the mining\\nvillagesofsouthWales shows thatadifferent combination ofsocial\\nrelations, but in a similarspatialstructure, can produce a very\\ndifferent result.Geography matters, butitdoesnotinitself\\ndetermine anyparticular socialoutcome. 286SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThepresentmajorgeographical reorganisation ofthe British\\nworking classrepresents, not some final defeat, but new problems\\nand new preconditions. Indeed, precisely as the economic strength\\nofourlargest cities is underattack,so those cities have become\\nimportant foci for resistance, new alliances are being constructed\\noutofthe wreckage, determined thatit shall go no further,andthat\\nreconstruction might be on otherterms. The response varies also by\\nregion. A reassertion of defensive solidarity in the old regions ofthe\\nindustrial periphery, anunbelieving clinging toindividualistic\\nconsumerism inpartsofthe midlands. Different periodsand forms\\nofpasteconomic development havecreatedtheconditions for very\\ndifferent labourmovements, and the legacy they leave as industrial\\ndecline sets in is correspondingly distinct.Itis truethatthegreater\\nmobilityofcapitalgives it the advantage in setting the terms ofthe\\nconflict. Indeed its high and increasing spatialmobility may prove\\nthehardestproblem to overcome, greaterthan thecharacteristics of\\nanyparticular newlocational pattern. The changes going on at the\\nmomentcan beconceptualised in termsofa shift between dominant\\nspatialdivisions of labour. Butthatis to talk of a social process,\\ninvolving disruption, change, and conflict: as such the outcome is\\nalwaysuncertain. 7\\nThe Reproduction ofInequality: A\\nQuestion ofPolitics\\nTheperiodwehave been lookingat has been a crucialone for British\\nsociety.Economically, sociallyandpolitically it hasundergone\\nenormous changes.Ithas also been transformed geographically .\\nThe old spatialdivisionoflabourbased on sector,oncontrasts\\nbetweenindustries, has gone into accelerated declineandin its place\\nhas arisen to dominance aspatialdivisionoflabourin which a\\nmoreimportant component is theinterregional spatialstructuring\\nofproduction withinindividual industries .Relations between\\neconomic activity in different partsofthecountry are now a\\nfunction ratherless ofmarketrelations between firms andrather\\nmore ofplannedrelations within them. Relations ofproduction are\\nincreasingly centralised in thesouthand east ofthecountry. There\\nis agrowing geographical, as well as social, division between\\nconception andexecution. Thecontinuing elements ofsectoral\\ndifferentiation only serve to reinforce thisdichotomy . Thegrowth\\nofnew\\'hi-tech\\' industries -biotechnology is aprimeexample - is\\nlargely in the already-favoured areas.Thisis the new spatial\\ndivision of labour,and itbringswith it a new north-southdivide.\\nThis time it is between the \\'sun belt\\'and the rest, where \\'therest\\'\\nconsistsofrelatively decentralised employment andgreatpools of\\nunemployment whereproduction used to be. Thisis,ofcourse, a\\nsimplification. Thedetail,as we have stressed andshall stress, is\\nmore complex, but the old form of the regionalproblem was always\\ncaricatured too. And the broadpictureisundeniable.\\nSpatialinequality hasdramatically changed its form.The indices,\\nthe social structure and themapitself: all have been transformed .\\nThe new kinds ofspatialorganisationofproduction nolongerlead\\ntoproblems ofexcessive dependence ofparticular areason\\nparticular industries .Insteadthey bring with them all the problems\\nof thecloning,part-process, subcontracting andotherspatial\\nstructures discussed in previous chapters. Thereis alsoanother\\nmajordifference. The spatialdivisionoflabourwhich was based\\naroundindustrial differentiation andspecialisation onlyproduced a\\n287 288SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\n\\'regional problem\\' when the sector in which the area was specialised\\nwent into decline or moved away. In the case ofthe newer spatial\\nstructures, and most particularly in the case ofthepart-process\\nstructure, thiscorrespondence between industrial andregional\\ndecline no longer holds. Increasingly, the ways in which companies\\nare being organised over space mean thatgeographical inequality is\\nactually inherent in thespatialstructure itself. In a way which is\\ntrueneitherofsectoral specialisation and local controlnor of\\nsimplebranch-plantstructures, this kind ofuseofspace isactually\\npredicated uponspatialinequality ; it requires it -and necessarily\\nreproduces it.Companies operating production hierarchies both\\ndependon andreproduce inequality while they are healthyand\\ngrowing. We have stressed a numberof times in the course ofthis\\nanalysis thatspatialinequality does not simply increase with the\\nhistorical development ofcapitalist society;thatthe process is more\\ncomplex, involving changes in form and natureas well as degree.\\nThatis true, but what does need to be said aboutthe new form and\\nnatureofgeographical inequality in Britain is thatit is integral not\\nto decline but to growth- or, at least, growthin anyofthe terms\\nwhich have been tried since the I960s. Itbecomes even more\\napposite to ask \\'a regional problem for whom?\\'\\nThe term \\'regional\\' is here, as throughout, being used generically\\nfor\\'spatial\\', orsubnational. Forit isclear thateven theshapeofthe\\nmap has been refashioned. Thecontours of the new spatialdivision\\noflabouraredifferent from those ofthe old. The \\'sunbelt\\' crosses\\nsouth-west ,south-east, eastmidlands and East Anglia. Regions\\nonly recently \\'central\\' in terms ofprosperity havejoinedthe\\neconomic periphery. And the geography we areactually faced\\nwith, the result ofthecombination ofanemergent spatialdivision\\noflabourwith the declining but stil1presentform of the old, is\\nhighlyintricate. No longer is there really a \\'regional\\' problem in the\\nold sense. No longer is there a fairly straightforward twofold\\ndivision, along a single line between central,prosperous areas and\\na decaying periphery . The map ofunemployment itself has under\\xad\\ngone a change, the persistent decline of the periphery now being\\naddedto by collapse in manufacturing regions and urbanareas.\\nEveryone ofthe\\'standard regions\\', prosperous orotherwise ,\\nincludes within it enormous variation, is inparticular plunged\\nthroughby thedereliction of the inner cities.\\nWithinthebroad-brush picturepresented earlier, then, there is a\\ncomplex mosaic ofgreat variety. The \\'Britishspatialproblem\\' of The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 289\\nthe lastquarterofthetwentieth centuryreflectsboththecontinued\\nreproduction oftheproblems andinequalities ofprevious spatial\\ndivisions oflabourand also, superimposed uponit, a new layer of\\ndisparities, thoseofthepresently emerging spatialdivision of\\nlabour.Itis precisely because this isnota simple processof\\ndeepening inequality but the superimposition ofdifferentstruc\\xad\\nturesthatdifferent regions gothrough different kinds(even\\ndifferent directions) ofchange.Thedynamic ofsocialreproduction\\nvariesgeographically andso do its effects on social composition .In\\nthe coalfields the old homogeneity of theworking class is being\\nbrokendown and the starkness of itsdistinction fromotherclasses\\nbeingblurred. Inmanyruralareas there is an increase in the\\nimportance ofaworking-class element in the social structure, and a\\ndeclineofsomeothercomponents .Inthesouth-east a process of\\nsocial dichotomisation appearsto beunderway. While professional\\nandmanagerial strataincrease in importance, manualworkers face\\na lossofmanufacturing jobsandadeclineinconditions of\\nemployment as casual work, the service sector,andwork within\\nsmall firms grow in relative importance .Different partsofthe\\ncountry havedifferent relationships with the international econo\\xad\\nmy, some functioning as theproduction outposts ofmultinational\\ncapital, someasmoreself-contained ornationally-orientated\\neconomies, othersas themselves bases for international empires.\\nWhen one puts all this together with the fact thatthe\\'regions\\' and\\n\\'localities \\' are themselves constantly beingformedandre-formed ,\\nconstructed anddisintegrated, thecomplexity ofthemosaicthatis\\nBritishindustrial geography isevident.\\nSo, too,shouldbe theimportance ofrecognising thatcomplexity\\nin analysis. Local uniqueness matters.Capitalistsociety, it is well\\xad\\nrecognised, develops unevenly. The implications aretwofold.Itis\\nnecessary tounearth thecommon processes, thedynamic of\\ncapitalist society,beneath theunevenness ,butit is also necessary\\ntorecognise, analyse andunderstand thecomplexity ofthe\\nunevenness itself.Spatialdifferentiation ,geographical variety, is\\nnotjustanoutcome:it isintegralto thereproduction ofsocietyand\\nitsdominant socialrelations. Thechallenge is to hold the two sides\\ntogether; tounderstand the general underlying causes while at the\\nsame time recognising andappreciating theimportance ofthe\\nspecificandtheunique.\\nSo a new social and industrial geography is in themaking, and a\\nnew set of disparities iscomingon to the agenda.Anoutcome of 290 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nchanging international andnational classrelations, this new spatial\\ndivision oflabouralso had the groundprepared for it by the\\npreceding one: the social reproduction ofinequality, one form of\\nspatialorganisation being aprecondition for the next. In Chapter5,\\nwe saw this process in operation in the coalfields. The presentlack\\nof\\'indigenous growth\\'in these regions is now frequently blamed,\\nbyacademics andpoliticians alike, on their \\'lack ofentrepreneur \\xad\\nship\\'. But to talk ofa lack of entrepreneurship is tocomment upon\\none aspect of class structure, and, as we have seen, in these regions\\nthe lackofa significant element of small capitalis to animportant\\nextent due to their previous industrial history-through boththe\\ndominance ofoligopolistic structures and the lack of development\\nofthosewhite-collar and technical stratafrom which \\'entrepre\\xad\\nneurs\\'typically emerge. Further, thenon-generation ofany real\\n\\'middle-class\\' strataunderthe previous division of labourproduced\\na lackoftheirassociated \\'culture and society\\' (Morgan, 1980,\\npp.31-2).Thiscombines withanother inheritance ofthe old\\nindustries - thedespoliation ofthenaturaland built environment\\n- to reinforce the difficulties of attracting theupperechelons of\\ntechnical and managerial staffin the new spatialstructures . Finally,\\nthe existence and the natureof the reserve offemalelabourhas\\nprovided one of the most important attractions to theincoming\\nindustries . It was not only the existence ofa reserve of labourwhich\\nwasimportant, but also the fact of its low levels oforganisation .\\nAnd these character istics - the lack ofprevious experience ofwage\\nrelations, themasculinity and sexism ofthe local culture- owe not\\na little to the preconditions established underthedominance of the\\nprevious spatialdivisionoflabour.\\nWhatwe see here are some of the mechanisms of thereproduc\\xad\\ntion of the spatialstructures ofdominance andsubordination and\\ntheirassociated effects. The process by which one use ofspace lays\\nthepreconditions foranotheris a complex one, and dependson the\\npolitical andorganisational response ofthe classes and social\\ngroupsinvolved. Whathashappened in these areas is thatboth\\nthe social dimensions ofinterregional differentiation andthe\\nunderlying economic structures on which they are based have\\nundergone atransformation. Thesubordination ofthese regions\\ncontinues , but the form ofthatsubordination and its social effects\\narechanging.\\nAgain, at the otherendofthecountrythe initial locationofthe\\nmachinery oftheState, and the concentration of\\'highstatus The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 291\\npeople\\',in thesouth-east ofEngland has been an important reason\\nfor thelatter\\'sincreasing concentration there. This is, again, not\\njustan\\'economic\\' mechanism but amechanism ofsocial class.\\nResidential preferences, andmoreparticularly thedifferential\\nability to operatethem, are a social means by which this stratum,\\nincreasingly important inabsolute terms as a result ofchanges in\\nproduction, has become so spatially concentrated . It is in a sense a\\nclass process ofcumulative causation and adynamic which is very\\ndifferent fromthatfound in otherpartsofthe social structure and\\ninotherpartsofthecountry. Here too the new spatialdivisionof\\nlabouris being built on the past.\\nIf the old spatialdivisionoflabourlaid the basis for the further\\nreproduction ofgeographical inequality, whataboutthe new one?\\nWhatare its dynamics; what does it hold in store? Itseems all too\\nclearthatittoocontains within it the basis for the further\\nreproduction ofinequality . In the old industrial Development\\nAreas, and in otherregionsofthecountry, the high levels of\\nexternalcontrol,the low levels oflinkage, the redundancy ofthe old\\nskillsoftheworkforce and the lack ofnew ones providelittle basis\\nforindigenous private-sector growth. In the\\'sunbelt\\' of thesouth\\nand east the cumulative causation which is underway will be\\ndifficult tostopby anyofthepresently accepted policiesof\\nindividual firm incentives. Thereare some signs ofchange; a few\\nheadquarters have been decentralised fromLondon, thoughoften\\nonly to the south-east, and some companies aremakingeffortsto\\nreunite research and production . This is particularly trueofnon\\xad\\nBritishcapitaland it is there, too, that higher levels ofmanagement\\nare to be found in peripheral regions(onceagainthe social\\ncharacter ofcapitalisall-important) .FromSilicon Valley comes\\na story which indicates thatthe process of cumulative causation\\nmight one day burnitself out. The competition forelectronics\\nengineers in thatarea is now so fierce thatsomecompanies are\\ndeliberately locating \\'their most important research and develop\\xad\\nmentprojects well away from Silicon Valley - where their top\\nengineers will be less likely to be tempted bycompetitors\\' (Kehoe,\\n1982). But overall, the signs are thatthedynamics inherent in the\\npresently-emerging spatialdivisionoflabourin the UK look set to\\nentrench thecountryinto a highly unequalgeography .\\nWhatkindofpolicyintervention might halt these trends,enablea\\nmore equal geographical future? One thing which is fascinating\\naboutthe period since the early sixties is the variety ofpolitical 292SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nstrategies which have been adopted. A couple ofversionsofsocial\\ndemocracy and a bold attempt to break outof the mould in a\\nrightwards direction .Noneofthem have solved the problems ofthe\\neconomy, nor is it yet clear thatanyofthem have brokenthe\\npolitical log-jam. Whatisabundantly clear isthateachofthese\\nstrategies for social and economic reorganisation , eachattemptto\\n\\'dosomething aboutthe British economy\\' has not only, by not\\nfacing them, been undermined bystructural social and economic\\ncontradictions , each has also, as partand parcel ofthe same\\nprocess,produced different patterns of uneven development. There\\niscertainly along-term shiftunderway in the national spatial\\ndivisionoflabour,but the variouscomponents ofit have been\\npushed forward differentially and unevenly with each economic and\\npolitical conjuncture .Strategies oftechnocratic reforming moder\\xad\\nnisation, epitomised by the White Heat of Wilsonism, reproduced\\n\\'theoldregional problem\\' with a vengeance . The decline of\\nemployment in the old imperial bases oftheperipheral regions,\\nespecially coal, was at its fastest. But at the same time, this strategy,\\noperated in a period when the world economy was still relatively\\nbuoyant,produced also the fastest growthofthe new spatial\\nstructures ,ofdecentralisation ofproduction to lessurbanareas\\nand to\\'theregions\\'.Itwas,moreover , aneconomic strategy\\ncombined with an active regional policy and important growthin\\nlocalStateemployment. All this together looked for a moment\\nreally like renovation: newjobsfor the regions, convergence of\\nunemployment rates. In reality it was the emergence ofone aspect\\nofa new form ofgeographical inequality . In the mid-seventies a\\ncombination ofprevarication onbotheconomic and regional fronts\\nled to less dramatic changes in the old Development Areas. But in\\nthe more recent industrial heartlands and in the inner cities the\\ndecline of manufacturing washeralding new\\'problem areas\\'. With\\ntheadventofThatcherism the balance ofprocesses changed again.\\nThe lossofjobsin the old Development Areas was accelerated once\\nmore and this time not justin the old basic industries but also in\\nsomeofthosedecentralised as recently as a decade before. Norwas\\nthere any new wave ofdecentralisation to plug the gap, not even\\nnewjobsin the local State sectors.The emergence of thatelementof\\nthe newspatialdivisionoflabourseemed to have gone into reverse,\\nor at least to have slowed down. But otherelements ofchange\\ncontinued apace. Britain\\'s manufacturing role in the international\\neconomy continued itsdramatic decline,takingwith it wide, and The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 293\\npreviously relatively prosperous ,areasofthecountry. Both\\npolitically andeconomically the room for manoeuvre for\\'doing\\nsomething abouttheregional problem\\' wasdramatically narrowed.\\nWhatall these contrasts show isthatthechanging formof\\'the\\nregional problem\\', andofspatialinequality moregenerally, is not\\ninevitable ,inexorable, oruniquely aquestion ofeconomics. Itis\\nalsopolitical. Inordertounderstand geographical shifts at any\\nparticular time it is necessary to understand theeconomic, andthe\\npolitical,characteristics oftheperiod.These three periodswith their\\ndifferent politicsandtheircontrasting economic backdrops and\\npressures, produced verydifferent movements in theindustrial and\\nsocialgeography ofthecountry. Theseoutcomes couldnot be read\\noffat this level from the stateof theeconomy .\\nBut on the otherhandandat adeeperlevel, allofthesepolitical\\nstrategies were themselves boundby theultimate constraint: the\\n.dominance .of\\'.capitalist relations ofproduction.\\nOneofthe main burdensofthisbookhas been to produce an\\ninterpretation ofspatialpatterns ofemployment in terms ofthe\\ngeographical organisation ofthesocialrelations ofcapitalist\\neconomic .activity. We have seen thatwhen the issue ofspatial\\nform isconsidered in·thisway.and not justas aquestion ofthe\\ngeographical distribution ofjobs, then even thenatureofthe\\nproblem changes. The issue ofexternal controlis not simply a\\nmatterofthegeography -ofownership, asmostcurrentarguments\\nimply. Any real solution would have to tacklealso the question of\\nthesociallocation ofcontrolandthedeeperorganisation of\\nproduction itself. As happened earlierthiscenturyin thenorth\\xad\\neastofEngland (seeChapter 5) and is to some extenthappening in\\nthenorth-west now(LloydandShutt, 1982), when a region\\nbecomes relatively unprofitable, capital- even\\'local\\'capital- will\\ndiversify its investments topastures new. It is true the growing size\\nandsectoral andgeographical spreadofindividual companies\\nincreases the flexibility oftheirinvestment. It is also true, there\\xad\\nfore,thattheexpansion ofmultiregional capital,andtherefore of\\nexternal control, will increase the problems for some regions - but\\nonly for those regions which are relatively unprofitable (Swales,\\n1979).

It is the samewith\\nthedifferential spatialdistribution ofoccupational groupsand\\nsocialstrata.Thenewspatialdivision oflabourdepends on a\\nparticular formoftechnolog y, one in whichsomedo all the\\nstrategic thinkwork andothersall theassembly orwhatever.

Fordecades now the battleoverlabourism, and to\\nsome extent over tradeunion power itself, has been fought in and\\noverparticular regions.Therecomposition ofnational social\\nstructure could not have taken place without thegeographical\\nchanges we have been documenting here. The formation of the\\ncharacteristics ofcertainclasses, and subgroups within classes, is\\nboundup with geographical form. The old heartofthelabour\\nmovement would not have been the same without geographical\\nconcentration, nor the shop stewards\\' movement inengineering \\xad\\nnor trades councils - withoutthe varied social infrastructure ofthe\\nbig cities. Todaycertainsocialstratahave their statusreinforced by\\nthe fact of their location.Thebattlesmay now be over new bases of\\nthe left - the big cities maybe. \\'Thinking geographically\\' ispartof\\nthinking aboutsociety more generally, and recognition andunder\\xad\\nstanding ofgeographical variation is essential for any strategyof\\nnational political change. 8\\nReflections on Debates over a Decade\\n8.1 Themes\\nTheargument thus far has been a complex one. Three sets of\\ninterlocking empirical investigations have been developed from the\\nopening theoretical chapters:aroundtheformation andnatureof\\ncertainspatialstructures ofproduction ,aroundthedifferential\\nconstruction oflocal areas and the consequently distinctive ways\\nin which they were affected by certainpartsof some of those spatial\\nstructures, andaroundhow at the national level these processes\\nwere themselves embedded in acontextwhere the articulation\\nbetween politics and economic geography exhibited clear changes\\nfrom one period to the next. Through allofthesechapters has run a\\ncomplexofthemes:aboutpolitics,aboutthenatureofexplanation,\\nabouttherelationbetween the social and the spatial,and so forth.\\nPrecisely because ofthis necessary complexity in the interweaving\\nofthe themes in the empirical analyses it is appropriate now to\\ndisentangle them again and to recapitulate them asseparatestrands\\nofargument. This also enables a return,thoughat a more abstract\\nlevel, to some ofthetheoretical argument first raised in the earlier\\nchapters ofthe book.\\nMoreover, since the publication of the first editionofSpatial\\nDivisions ofLabour, debateon anumber ofthese issues has\\nblossomed further.There has been controversy provoked by the\\nbookitself;therehavebeenbothappreciative reviews and\\ncontestatory critiques which took issue with some of the proposi\\xad\\ntionsadvanced, and there have been constructively critical evalua\\xad\\ntions and uses ofthematerial and ideas which have taken further\\nthe germs ofthoughts putforwardin thebook. It is time, therefore,\\nfor some assessment oftheposition. I have not made any attempt\\nto reply to, or consider in detail, all the articles referenced. That\\nwould have been an impossible task! Rather,I haveorganised my\\nthoughts aroundfourpersistent fociofdebate: the first two ofthese\\nconcerntherelationship ofthe book to Marxism and to the analysis\\n296 Reflections on Debates over a Decade 297\\nofcapitalism, andtheapproach toexplanation which I try to\\ndevelop.Bothofthese facets ofthebookprovoked considerable\\nfurorewhen it was first published .

In fact,\\nit wasintended asneitheracaricature norarejection ofeverything\\nMarxist, andstill less ofAlthusserian Marxism (seeSocietyand\\nSpace,1987). But it does insist on exploring someofthecomplex\\xad\\nities -andproblems -ofthistroubled field. It is therefore perhaps\\nhelpful to consider this issue at greaterlength.\\nCapitalism\\nThearguments advanced in thisbookconcern themechanisms ofa\\nspecifically capitalist economy andsociety.Itisimportant to be 298 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\npreciseaboutwhat this statement means.Thereare anumberof\\nways in which it is true.First,thecentralfocusofempirical\\nattention is on those aspects oftheinternational economy, on a\\nparticular national economy , and on industrial sectorsand indivi\\xad\\ndualcompanies whichfunction within a framework ofprivate\\ncapitalist accumulation .Theeconomic mechanisms /causalpro\\xad\\ncesses on which attention istrainedare those ofprivateaccumula\\xad\\ntion forprofit.Thereare some exceptions to this,mostparticularly\\ntheexamination atvariouspointsin thebookof sectors which in\\ntheUnitedKingdom have been organised throughtheState.Chief\\namongthese are the majornationalised industries (in the case of this\\nbookparticularly thecoal-mining industry) and the hugely impor\\xad\\ntantemployment sectorsofthe welfare state(particularly health,\\neducation , andotherlocalgovernment employment). Thesesectors\\nhave been and still are ofimmense significance in theshifting\\nnational urbanandregional geography. The only otherform of\\nproduction which is directly considered and which lies outsidethe\\nnormalspecification of\\'purelycapitalist\\' isthatofthepetty\\nbourgeoisie. Here, however, whatis really at issue is a form of\\nproduction which tends towardscertainpetty-bourgeois traits(and\\nwherethatend-concept istherefore useful in its characterisation)\\nbutwhich is clearly set within, and influenced by, asurrounding\\neconomy which is capitalist.\\nSecond, whatthis focus on capitalist relations means is that\\ncertainaspectsbothofthetheoretical framework andofthe\\nempirical analyses arenotsimplygeneralisable toother, non\\xad\\ncapitalist, societies. This is true, for instance, oftheframework of\\nclassrelations laid out in Chapter2 (seeespecially Section 2.3 Social\\nstructures andcapitalist relations ofproduction) and it is true ofthe\\nempirical analyses ofthemajority oftheindustrial sectors. The\\nmechanisms at work, in one form or another, are those ofprivate\\ncapitalist accumulation. Ironically , this isperhapsclearest,certainly\\nmostexplicit, in those sections ofthebookwhere direct comparison\\nis made with partsof theeconomy whichfunction according to\\notherprinciples - thediscussion inChapter4 (especially Section 4.4\\nOtherconsumer services: privatecapitalandtheState)isprobably\\nthe most extended example - where the contrast inmechanisms is\\nclearlyshownalso to involve acontrast ininherent causal\\ntendencies (which is not, ofcourse,to saythattheoutcomes will\\nnecessarily be different! - see below) - indeed in the public sector\\nthese will dependuponthedominant politics. The reasonfor Reflections on Debates over a Decade 299\\nmakingthispointis inorderto be clear aboutthe limits to the\\nrange of applicability oftheanalyses inprevious chapters, and to\\nstress the conceptual approach. However, to say thatthese are\\nspecifically capitalist relations does not mean thatnoneoftheir\\ncharacteristics will ever arise as an issue in otherformsofsocial\\norganisation of theeconomy. Questions ofhierarchy, ofspecialisa\\xad\\ntion and oftherelations between specialisms, andofcoordination,\\nand the social problems which these pose, are by no meansconfined\\nto societies which we define as capitalist.\\nHowever, if theparticular mechanisms studiedare specifically\\ncapitalist, andtheiranalysis thus not simply transferable toother\\nformsofeconomic relations, it is none the less truethatthe wider\\nframework, thebroadest arguments which guide the very form of\\nthese analyses, aregeneralisable. Thus,thearguments forthinking\\nin terms of relations, for thecentralanalytical importance ofthe\\nnotionofthe complex structuring ofdefinitions andofcausality\\n(theconceptofarticulation), and for the mutualconstitution ofthe\\nsocial and the spatial,all these are generalisable propositions which\\ncould indeed be used in an analysisof societies very different in the\\nfunctioning oftheir\\'economies \\' (if indeed such a concept were\\napplicable) from the UnitedKingdom in the late twentieth century.\\nAnexampleoftheapplication oftheframework to asocietywhich\\niscomposed ofbothcapitalist and\\'pre-capitalist\\' elements and\\nlayers can be found in Fahey(1989).\\nThereis athirdway,moreover, in which SpatialDivisions of\\nLabourisaboutcapitalist socialrelations. This isthatit isabouta\\nsocietywhich it specifies as characterised bycapitalist forms.\\nMoreover it is this aspectof the society which is the focus ofthe\\nempirical attention. Theprecision of thisformulation isagain\\nimportant. To saythata society is capitalist isnotto saythatit\\nisnototherthings as well, such as racist, homophobic, sexist. UK\\nsociety is indeed characterised by all of these things. The focus of\\nthebook,however, is on the specifically capitalist-economic\\nmechanisms withinthatsociety.Moreover, this setofmechanisms\\n(this fact of its being capitalist) is taken to be significant. Thus:\\'The\\nfactthattheUnitedKingdom is acapitalist societymeansthatthe\\nbroadformsofits social organisation are built aroundthe class\\nrelations ofcapitalist production ... This is essential to allthat\\nfollows.Itgoverns thestructure ofsociety, the organisation of\\nproduction andmany of the unquestioned assumptions ofdaily life.\\n\"Itis taken for granted, \\'in the way things work\\', thatprofitshould 300 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbe thenormalyardstick ofinvestment in mostareasofactivity:that\\nthe living standards ofthepropertyless majority shouldbe set\\nprimarily by the terms on which they sell or once sold their labour\\n. . .poweris to be found more in uneventful routinethanin\\nconscious and active exercise of will\" (Chapter 2, p. 16). This is a\\nstrongstatement; thatclass and the fact ofitscapitalist natureis a\\ncentralstructuring principle in the characterisation of UK society.\\nMoreover Icontinue to agree with thatstatement today,although I\\nmightformulate itratherdifferently: for while to talk ofbroad\\nforms of social organisation being built aroundthe class relations\\nanddivisions of labourofcapitalist production is, I believe, correct,\\ntodesignate them as thebroadforms is to accept certain(hidden)\\nassumptions aboutwhich I might now be more circumspect. Chief\\namongst these isthatthe term \\'broadformsofsocialorganisation\\'\\nrefers to thatnexusofsocial divisions which defines itself in terms\\nof income /relation to\\'theeconorny \\'rrelation to paid work. This,\\nhowever, is notthe only way in which society is structured . If, for\\ninstance, such forms ofsocialorganisation were to refer to the\\nreproduction ofthe species or to certainotheraspectsofsocial\\ninteraction overwhelmingly predominant in alleconomic classes,\\nthen we might argue thatthey were built aroundthestructure of\\nheterosexist andpatriarchal definitions of, anddistributions of\\npeople into, categories calledmasculine and feminine.\\nHowever, to returnto theframework of the book: although it\\narguesthatclass and capitalist relations arecentralstructuring\\nfeatures of the society in question, it also states thatthere ismoreto\\nthatsocietythancapitalism. Thus,on the page following the\\nquotation above,andconcluding the same section,it ispromised\\nofthe analysis that\\'Thereis a stress on the interconnections\\nbetween \"theeconomic\" andotherareasoflife, aconcern about\\nhow to use \"lawsof thecapitalist modeofproduction\" inempirical\\nanalysis, and an emphasis on the fact thatacapitalist society is far\\nmorethanthecapitalist mode of production\\' .\\nLatersections ofthischapter will deal with someofthe\\nimplications ofthisstatement. The rest ofthis section, however,\\nwill stay with the question ofcapitalism .Inwhatsense does the\\nanalysis in the bookinsist on this? - for, as has been noted,it has\\nbeen seen by some as deserting the cause of, certainly theoretical,\\nMarxism .One\\'sopinion on thismatter, as so often, depends on\\nwhat one means. Reflections on Debates over a Decade 301\\nStructures, laws and tendencies\\nThebroad,framing structure softheanalysis in thisbookare\\nconceptualised , as has alreadybeen said, as specifically capitalist.\\nThus, to take perhapsthe most obviousexample, theframework for\\ntheconceptualisation ofclass,andforthedefinition ofand\\ndistinctionbetween different places within the class structure , is\\nrelevant specifically and only to a capitalist-dominated economic\\nstructure . It would not be relevantto adominantly socialistsociety,\\nnor does it have any meaning inrelationtofeudalism. And it is not\\nsimplytransferable to ananalysisofthe forms ofsociety which until\\nrecently were dominant ineasternEurope.Chapter 2 (Section 2.3\\nSocialstructures andcapitalist relations ofproduction : A frame\\xad\\nwork, pp. 3(}-8)setsoutthe basic outlinesofthisapproach, based\\nonWright\\'s work in the mid-seventies. Wright\\'s formaltriangleis\\npresented, andrecommended as a way of establishing, andthus\\nholdingup toexploration, twoimportant conceptual linkages. The\\nfirst, between specific functions within a capitalist society at any\\npointin time and the social groupswhich at thattimeperformthose\\nfunctions , issubsequently to be the basis for a reformulated analysis\\nofthegeography ofemployment as thegeography offunctions and\\nof the social relations whichconstitute thosefunctions. The second\\nlink which the framework enablesis between class structure and\\nlong-term processes ofcapitalist development (p.31).Inother\\nwords,boththe internal conceptualisation ofanyindividual place\\nwithin the class structure andthecharacterisation ofitsbroad\\ndelineament anddevelopment is firmly historico-materialisl.\\nAll of this is fairly basic, andperhaps evenmundane . But it is\\nimportant toestablish as aprecursor to a second issue. Forthis is\\nindeed only a framework; it is a tool which can be used in analysis.\\nBut itcannotbelaid upon a set ofempirical facts in the hopethatthe\\nreal world will \\'fit\\', it is notstaticbut precisely a flexible framework\\nby means ofwhichmovement andchangecan beanalysed; and such\\nmovement andchangecannotbeassumed to have any predetermined\\ndirection. Thereisa whole host of issueshere. The sectioninChapter\\n2deals for example with some ofthepotential sourcesofvariation \\xad\\ngenerated frombothwithin and without theformalframework \\xad\\nwhich might be found in the class structure ofany specific capitalist\\nsociety. The argument which is significant at thispoint,however, is\\nthatwhilebroadstructures ofacapitalist society are recognised, and 302SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwhile these broadstructures areconceptualised ashavingtendencies\\ntodevelop incertainways,and(notthe same thing) as having\\nhistorically developed inparticular directions, thereisalsoa\\nthorough-going rejection ofdeterministic laws,predetermined out\\xad\\ncomes or ineluctable stagesofhistory.\\nThesepointsmay be spelled outindividually. Toconceptualise\\nphenomena ascapitalist is also to recognise thatthere is an aspect\\nof things which may be systematically sodesignated .Moreover , the\\nphenomena socharacterised in theanalysis hereincludebroad\\nstructures ofsociety (such as class structure). Thereis thus no\\nrestriction towhatissometimes called\\'local\\'theory.Withinall\\narguments ofthis kind lurks in recent years the contested issue of\\nmetanarratives. Thecritiqueof metanarratives has been a central\\npartof thepostmodern questioning ofcertainformsofmodernist\\ntheorising, andit isperhaps worthpausing for amoment to\\nconsider its relevance here. As ever in debates in thisareathe\\nterms are slipperyandhalftheproblem isdefinition; so it will help\\nto focus down.Oneofthemostthorough-going andwidely\\nreferenced critiques ofmetanarrative was made by Jean-Francois\\nLyotard. ForLyotard (1984), the term metanarrative has two sides.\\nOn the one handit refers to totalising philosophies ofhistory: big\\nstorieswhich (in the end) account foreverything andwhich have a\\ndegreeofimmanent inexorability in theirunfolding . He would see\\nthisapproach ascharacteris ing theEnlightenment confidence in the\\nprogress ofreasonandfreedom andMarxism\\'s attachment , in\\nmanyof its forms, to a marchofclassconflictwhich is definitely\\nseen, over the long term, as going forward. On theotherhandthe\\nterm refers to discourses whichclaimaprivileged status,by\\nclaiming to have access to a truththrough whichotherdiscourses\\ncan beevaluated (while they themselves assertatranshistorical \\xad\\nandtransgeographical - validity). The position arguedinSpatial\\nDivisions ofLaboursharesmuchofthiswariness ofmetanarrative\\ndefinedin this way. Thereare two things which are of particular\\nimportance inrelation to thediscussion at thispoint.First, the\\nargument here rejects a view which positsasingle/most funda\\xad\\nmental/uniquely privileged axis ofexplanation inrelationto which\\nfoundation all societal changecanultimately be explained andin\\ncomparison with which othercausalstructures are subsidiary. The\\ncrucialpointhere for me is thatno onecausalstructure , orstory\\xad\\nline,shouldbetakento befoundational in the sense ofbeing at the\\nrootof everything . In specific relationto thearenaofdiscussion of Reflections on Debates over a Decade 303\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,while class is one ofthecentralfociof\\nattention itcannotbeassumed to be, in any given situation, the\\nmostfundamental axisofsocialrelations.Second, moreover, the\\napproach adopted here rejects any versionofgrandnarrative\\nwhich, implicitly or explicitly, entailstheunfolding ofastory\\nwhosecourseisalreadyknown. Both these issues will be taken\\nup again in otherpartsofthischapter. Forthemoment it is\\nimportant topursuethe logic (and sometimes non-sequiturs) ofthis\\nargument.\\nForrejecting this version ofgrandnarratives, andinthatmanner\\naccepting someofthecritiques ofmodernist formulations made by\\npostmodernists, is toaddresssomequiteprecise issues. Itdoesnot\\nnecessarily imply rushingoffto theotherendofsomepostulated\\nspectrum andinsisting thatthe only thing thatis possible is the\\ninvestigation ofthe local and the discrete. \\'Meta\\',in themeaning of\\nmetanarrative outlined above, has adefiniteandparticular mean\\xad\\ning: it does not justmean big. It is in partLyotard\\'s own writings\\nwhich have generated confusion here.Thus,thedefinition of\\'local\\'\\nis even more problematic thanthatof\\'meta\\'.Certainly it does not\\nhave any necessary connection to thegeographical useofthe term\\n(see Massey, 1991). Whatit seems primarily to beinvoking is an\\ninsistence on a lack ofconnectedness in anybroad,wide-ranging\\nsense. The \\'local\\' refers to a conceptually relatively discrete set of\\nsocialrelations,practices, institutions, and so forth. Furthermore ,\\nthatnotionoflocalness finds no placeinanapproach to\\nconceptualisation such asthatadvocated here which insists on the\\ncomplex interrelation of things. Connection, as well as differentia\\xad\\ntion,arewhatit is all about.Indeed, as will be seen later,\\nconnection isarguedto be an important partoftheconstitution\\nofdifferentiation. Lyotard, however, does introduce his ownnotion\\nofconnection, through his ideaof\\'the social bond\\'.But, at the\\nsame time, he insists thatthepractices which in some sense he calls\\nuponto hold society together are so varied andsorestricted in their\\nscope(theirpervasiveness within society) thatno general categories\\nsuch asgender,race or class are validly usable. Thereis, however, a\\ncrucial leap here from a rejection ofparticular practices/social\\nrelations astotalising to the rejection ofthenotionofanybroad\\nstructures (such as those pertaining to class or gender,andtherefore\\nno possibility of a critiqueofthem atthatlevel) at all.\\nItis not necessary, havingrejectedmetanarratives , to reject any\\nnotionofbroad(butnon-totalising) structures ,mostespecially if at 304SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe same time their multiplicity andcomplexity is recognised. This\\npointis wellarguedfrom a feminist perspective by Fraserand\\nNicholson (1988) in theirunravelling ofLyotard\\'s postmodernism .\\nAnd indeed, as they demonstrate, Lyotard himself has resortin\\npracticein his analysis of \\'society\\'to farbroaderstructures than his\\nmoreanalytically prescriptive mode would seem to warrant: his\\ninvocation ofapparently widespread structures andpractices of\\ninstrumental reason,and hiscritiqueofsuchstructures, as wellas, I\\nwould add, the broadperiodisation on which the analysis rests, are\\nprecisely cases in point.\\nThus,SpatialDivisions ofLabourrejectsmetanarratives in the\\nmeaning attributed above but it does not therefore adoptaposition\\nwhich restricts itself only to local structures; broadstructures, but\\nwhich are assumed to be multiple, non-totalising andwithoutpre\\xad\\ngivennarratives areacceptable , indeed necessary to the approach.\\nTherecognition ofsuchbroadstructures is not the same as the\\ncommitment to, oradoption of, ametanarrative viewofhistory.\\nNoneofthestructures which are identified need be assumed to have\\nanyinexorability in their unfolding. And in the analysis here it is\\nresolutely assumed thatthey do not;outcomes arealways\\nuncertain ,history- andgeography - have to be made.\\nItis, however, this commitment againstdeterminism which\\nprompted some discussion aboutthestatusof\\'theory\\'. A rejection\\nofthis criticism involves, perhaps, both a lesser commitment on my\\npartto tying everything down,hammering it into place, so that\\nthere is an overarching \\'order\\'in which I know where everything is\\n(for Idon\\'tand never can) and a disputeover what it is which\\nshouldgo by the name \\'theory\\'.Forme, this term most usefully\\nrelates to a process ofrigorous conceptualisation, itselfdrawing on\\npreviously-achieved understandings ofthephenomena inquestion,\\nand which in turn will involve the identification ofpotential causal\\nstructures. Itdoes not imply propositions aboutnecessary empirical\\noutcomes. Thereasoning behind this formulation will beelaborated\\nlater, in the section on Explanation (8.3).Forthemoment it is\\nstatedsimply as a presupposition ofmy analysis.\\nThus, in the discussion ofclassstructure, each of the sides of\\nWright\\'s triangle is related to the development oflong-term changes\\nwithin classically capitalist-dominated societies. The dimension\\nbetween bourgeoisie andworking class reflects the long historical\\nprocessoftheseparation ofeconomic ownership from possession Reflections on Debates over a Decade 305\\nand the development ofcomplex hierarchies within each ofthese\\nmajorfunctions (p. 35). The dimension between proletariat and\\npettybourgeoisie reflects\\'thelong process of removalofimmediate\\njobcontrolfrom direct producers\\' (p. 36).Thereare twopointsto\\nnote here. First, the references here to long-term developments are\\nreferences to actualhistorical changes - changes withincapitalist\\nsocieties which are generally recognised to have happened. They are\\nnot references to necessary immanent logics. Second, where the\\ncausesofthesehistorical changesare identified as lying within the\\nstructure ofcapitalist relations it is none the less still maintained\\nthat such causal powers do not necessarily result in a particular\\noutcome. Thus,on thedimension between bourgeoisie and petty\\nbourgeoisie . . .\\'onceagain there is a spectrum , reflecting boththe\\ndying-out ofself-employment inindustries where fully capitalist\\nrelations ofproduction areestablished and thecontinual regrowth\\nofself-employment inotherpartsoftheeconomy \\' (p. 37).\\nInotherwords, and once again to quotemyself \\'The framework,\\ntherefore, represents not astatictypology, ready to be fitted on to a\\npiece of the real world, but a set ofsocial processes within which\\nthere isconstanttensionand behind which lie the conflicts ofa\\ncapitalist society\\'(p. 37). The aim is conceptualisation andunder\\xad\\nstanding, not \\'prediction\\' ofpre-determined outcomes.\\nOne way in which this form of\\'prediction \\'oftentakes place in\\nsocial science analysis is retrospectively, with reference to things\\nwhich have alreadyhappened .Thuscurrentorhistorical changes,\\nwhich may in themselves be empirically undisputed, aresometimes\\ninterpreted inrelation to causal processes immanent incapitalist\\nrelations and - and this is the step in the procedure which is being\\nobjected-to here- asnecessarily produced bythosecausal\\nprocesses. This procedure occurs for instance in some (not all)\\nversions oftheFordism --+post-Fordism/neo-Fordisrn /flexible\\naccumulation sequence which has in recent years been identified\\nincapitalist production and(sometimes) inwidercapitalist\\nrelations.Thus,the endofan era(Fordism) isidentified empiri\\xad\\ncally, the opening of a new one is specified, and even thoughwe\\nnever foresaw beforehand eitherthebreakdown ofthe old or the\\ntransition to the new, the whole process isall too frequently, and all\\ntoo easily, interpreted aspartoftheinevitable working out of\\ntendencies inherent incapitalist society.Itisrarefor such a\\nformulation ofinevitability to be explicit, and in some analyses - 306SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsuch asthatofPiore and Sabel (1984)- it is clearly countered . But\\nin lesscareful analysis it isoften there implicitly.Things are this way\\nso they had to be this way.\\nThisformulation ofchange ifonlyimplicitly intermsof\\ninevitable sequences is rejected in the analysis put forward in this\\nbook.Thus, threedifferent types ofspatialstructure ofproduction\\nareidentified (single-region, cloning, andpart-process) .Moreover ,\\nit is also arguedthateachofthesehas been ofparticular\\nsignificance at different periodsin thehistoryofcapitalist relations\\nin the United Kingdom . However, the logic here is thatthis is why\\nthese three broadtypes have been selected for analysis and to serve\\nasexemplars (more on this later). Itisnotthatthey are three\\nnecessary stages which issue inexorably the oneintotheother(see\\nSection 3.2 Spatialstructures ofcapitalist production :Conceptua\\xad\\nlising the spatialorganisation ofproduction). Thusit ispointedout\\nthatthis is\\'notastatictaxonomy ofspatialstructures\\'...andthat\\nthe\\'emergence ofparticular kindsofspatialstructure willdepend\\non the level ofdevelopment ofdifferent aspectsoftherelations of\\nproduction\\' (p.77).However, it is also stressed boththatthe\\nemergence ofparticular conditions is only an enabling development\\n(it does not necessitate any specific effect) and thatpersistent\\nempirical movements , even in quite opposite directions , can also\\noftenbe identified (see pp. 77-9).Noneofthis is to argue thatin the\\nsocial sciences we cannotattemptto foresee directions ofchange;\\nthewholeaimofmuchofsuchworkisprecisely to try to\\nunderstand inorderto bebetterprepared. But thehistorywhich\\nis to come cannotbe forecast on the basis oftheworking outofa\\ndeterminate logic, a single logical principle.\\nThus,aftertheoutlineofthe basic class framework inChapter 2,\\nthreeReflections arepresented . Thesecondofthese precisely\\nconcerns this issue, and it takes as its majorexample the thesis of\\nanincreasing spatialcentralisation ofeconomies undercapitalism.\\nAll the elements ofthisargument arepresentthere.Explanation of\\nanempirical phenomenon cannotbeadequately established merely\\nbyrecourse to apostulated law orimmanent tendency . This is not\\nto saythatimmanent tendencies (in another terminology ,causal\\npowers) do notexist; they do and they are important to identify.\\nBut they cannotbeidentified by\\'observation ofactualempirical\\ntendencies followed byattempts tore-readthem as logically\\nnecessary outcomes ofapurecapitalist modeofproduction \\'\\n(p. 47).Thecase here is particularly poignant, for it refers to \\'the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 307\\nincreasing necessity for Stateprovision ofthe general conditions of\\nproduction andreproduction\\' (p. 47). Nothing moreclearly\\nillustrates thedangersofseeingcurrentdevelopments aslong-term\\nhistorical necessity than all the many \\'theorisations\\' in this way in\\nthe 1970s ofthe inevitability ofincreasing Stateintervention .\\nMoreover, thetendencies/causal powers which may be identified\\nare not \\'laws\\' in the sense ofnecessarily resulting in specific\\noutcomes. Thus \\'even had some general logical spatialtendencies\\nof a\"capitalist modeofproduction\" beenestablished, they would\\nnot in themselves be an explanation of theenormously complex\\ngeographical historyofactualcapitalist societies\\' (p. 48). Such a\\ncomplexity can only be coped with through arecognition ofthe\\nequal complexity ofcausalstructures. It is this issue which is taken\\nup in Section 8.3, Explanation, below.\\nFlowsofvalue and the analysis ofclass relations\\nThephenomena and the causalprocesses which figure in the\\npreceding chapters areconceptualised in terms ofclass, and in\\nmore general terms social, relations and not in terms of value.\\nThis, I have come increasingly to believe, is an important distinc\\xad\\ntion. Value analysis and class analysis are ofcourse not mutually\\nexclusive approaches; they are indeed clearly related. And value\\nitself, as isoft repeated, is a social relation. However, they do often\\nexist uneasily side by side in empirical analysis. Moreover it seems\\nto me to make an important difference to the whole tenorof an\\nanalysis, which of the two is adoptedas the main entry-point. This\\nis quiteapartfrom the byzantine entanglements into which the \\'law\\nofvalue\\' has fallen and which make it, in my view, unusable in any\\nempirical economic calculus. This is not to say thatthe concept of\\nvalue is not useful for thinking throughthebroadstructures ofthe\\neconomy and for forming the absolutely necessary basis for some\\ncentralconcepts -exploitation , forinstance. Butthatis quite\\ndifferent from the, in my view vain, attempts to use it as a basis\\nfor empirical economic calculation - thefrequent references in some\\nliterature to things such as \\'the organiccomposition ofcapital\\',for\\ninstance, often being in fact references to capitalintensity measured\\nin terms ofprice. However besides all these technical objections it\\nseems to me thatthere are also important implications for the\\nnatureofanalysis which arise from takingclassratherthanflowsof\\nvalue or even ofcapitalas the initial frame. 308SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nPerhaps most obviously, class interests as perceived by the\\nmembers of any class are not necessarily the same as economic\\ninterests and particularly not necessarily the same as shortor\\nmedium-term economic interests. Moreover class interests may\\noverride immediate economic interests, or may hold the key to\\nunderstanding why long-term ratherthanshort-term economic\\nadvantage proved to be decisive as a basis for action. There are\\nmany examples of this in foregoing chapters. At a broadlevelthere\\nis Gamble\\'s analysis of thatstrong strain in British Conservatism\\n\\'forwhich the maintenance of social power and relatively stable\\nclassrelations has been of far greaterimportance thanany\\nparticular \"bourgeois\" economic ideology, such as that ofthe free\\nplay of market forces\\' (p. 44). There are the frequent analyses of\\ntypes of capital - maybe old-fashioned, small or middling-sized \\xad\\nwhere\\'accumulate, accumulate\\' is certainly not the name of the\\ngame, where even the smallest positive rate ofprofit is an enabling\\ncondition for being what one primarily is, a maker of shirts for\\ninstance. The example of the woollen-textile industry (see Chap\\xad\\nter 6, pp. 268 passim),is a case in point where there was neither the\\nwill to maximise profits nor the willingness to withdraw from\\nproduction justbecause profits failed. Or again, there were the\\nanxiousintrospections of theConfederation ofBritishIndustry in\\nthetempestuous earlyyearsofMrsThatcher\\'s rule:After\\n\\'numerous boardroom battles... most companies retained their\\nlonger-term political and class loyalties above more immediate\\neconomic interests\\' (p. 258). An analysis which thoughtin terms\\nof categories defined only by the economic, or which expected\\nactions to be simply determined by the economic or, even more, by\\nvalue, could not accountfor such apparently anomalous formsof\\nbehaviour .\\nOne implication of this is that more thoughtneeds to be given to\\nthe way in which we characterise capital.Although \\'industry\\' is the\\nfocusofso much analysis - the central object of attention in\\nindustrial geography - it still seems to me thatremarkably little\\nwork has been done on this issue. It is for this reason thatan\\nattemptto get to grips with the question is presented right at the\\nbeginning of this book (Section 2.2, Characterising capital). For\\nwhat is clear throughout all thesubsequent analyses is thatcapital\\nis divided in ways far more complex (and including non-economic)\\nthan the simple criteria which are usually deployed in industrial\\nstudies (sector, size, place in the economy). In any given actual Reflections on Debates over a Decade 309\\nsocietycapitalisdifferentiated also by such thingsas social\\ncharacter, temperament , regional history. Moreover , as the ana\\xad\\nlysesthroughout thebook, andperhaps particularly those in\\nChapter 6, try to show, these differences are of real importance\\nbothto anyunderstanding ofthebehaviour ofparticular partsof\\nthe economy (how they respond to given economic pressures, for\\ninstance) and to analysis ofthe economy as a whole and ofits\\ngeography. The usual categories ofeconomic geography are simply\\nnot good enough; what is needed isan analysis ofthe class structure\\nofcapital.\\nBehind these points,ofcourse, liesa broaderargument: thatit is\\nimpossible simply to separate-off \\'theeconomic\\' from the political,\\nculturaland ideological aspects of society. IThe first ofthe three\\nReflections referred to above, and which follow the laying outofthe\\nclassframework, concerns this issue. Notonly are \\'politics and\\nideology . . . not to beinterpreted as simple reflections ofthe\\neconomic\\' but\\'politicsand ideology are themselves important in\\ntheconstruction ofthe economic\\' (p. 43).\\nOne way in which this isclearly true is thateconomic phenomena\\nhave to be interpreted. They are not simply objective datato which\\nthere willbe a knee-jerk response.There isan emphasis on this need\\nfor, and importance of,interpretation throughout the book. Itis\\nthere in the analysis ofthe response ofdifferent kindsofcapitalto\\nparticulareconom icpressures; it isthereintheattempt to\\ncharacterise capital;it is there in the analysis ofthenational\\neconomy. Thus, on the last, the shift in the later seventies towards\\nmonetarism was inparta political shift in the analysisofthe\\neconomy ; itconcerned \\'the political formulation ofthe economic\\nsituation as being primarily aproblemofinflation\\' (pp. 255-6), for\\ninstance; it involved re-working thedistinction between \\'productive \\'\\nand \\'non-productive\\' partsoftheeconomy (pp. 256 -7)- a\\nreinterpretation which had dramatic effects at bothmacro-econom\\xad\\nic and regional levels. \\'So it has not justbeenchanging economic\\ncircumstances which have been important but also changes in the\\nway in which economic pressures were filtered, moulded and\\ntranslated through theprevailing political and ideological climate\\'\\n(p. 227). The motifofall these arguments, and one which is\\nrepeated invarious formsthroughout thebook, isthat\\'the\\nrequirements ofaccumulation do not arrive raw at the factory gate\\'.\\nSuch a view leaves the analysis open,notjustto\\'politics,\\nideology . . .\\' etc. in their broadsenses but also to all those other 310SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsocialrelations andaxesofsocialdifferentiation which in some\\nsense intheirorigins(though not intheirformation andreproduc \\xad\\ntion) are autonomous from\\'theeconomic\\' as it is usually defined\\nandyet which are thoroughly implicated in its form. The axis which\\ngetsmostattention in theanalyses here(though far lessthanit\\nshouldhave got) is genderrelations.TheElaborations (p. 39) to the\\nclassframework, forinstance, arguethat\\'ideologies ofraceand\\ngendercriss-cross thelabourmarket\\' andtalkintermsof\\n\\'ideologically determined labourmarkets\\'. The \\'industrial location\\ndecision\\', in otherwords,\\'isjustonemoment in a much wider\\neconomic, ideological andpolitical field\\' (p. 42).\\nAndfinally, all ofthesethingsleave open in the analysis a\\nnecessary space for agency, andforpolitics.Theopeningdiscussion\\ninChapter 2 triesbothto insist on this andtodifferentiate this\\nconceptofagency from the voluntaristic, free-floating-individual\\nvarietywhich is oftenset up in contradistinction tosupposed\\n\\'determinism\\' (see pp. 14-15).\\'Historical changecomesabout\\nthrough socialprocesses andsocialconflict... thisapproach\\nentailsa fardeeperrejection of\"determinism\" (p. 15; see also,\\nforinstance, p. 100). Thus,andharking backto theearlier\\ndiscussion onstructures andlaws, there is an insistence on the\\nfactthatnewspatialstructures comeabout,notthrough some\\nineluctable shifts,butthrough active social engagement (see, for\\nexamples, pp.82-90on anexample from the car industry; pp.289\\xad\\n91 onspatialstructures in general in the UK; andp. 293 on the\\nchanging formoftheregional problem) .\\'Theprocessby which one\\nuseofspace lays the preconditions foranotheris acomplex one,\\nanddepends on thepolitical andorganisational response ofthe\\nclassesandsocialgroupsinvolved\\' (p. 290); \\'Theevolution of\\ndifferent kindsofspatialstructure, theirestablishment, mainte\\xad\\nnanceandeventual collapse andchange, are not simply determined\\nby thecharacteristics ofthelabourprocess, therequirements of\\naccumulation , the stages ofthemodeofproduction, or even the\\ndemands ofcapital.Noneofthese things in themselves \"resultin\"\\nspecificspatialforms.Spatialstructures areestablished, reinforced ,\\ncombated andchanged through political andeconomicstrategies\\nandbattleson thepartofmanagers ,workers andpolitical\\nrepresentatives \\' . . . they are \\'theobjectofpolitical struggle\\'\\n(p. 82).

This changes thepolitical strategies forconfronting them.\\nAndhereagain,thereis noassumption abouttheoutcome ofany\\npolitics. Unlikeinmoredeterministic formulations ,capitalis here\\nnotassumed to get its own way, willy nilly.\\n8.3Explanation\\nIt was,however, Ithink, thiscommitment touncertainty ,along\\nwith theassociated resolve to recognise (andindeed to value) variety\\nanduniqueness, whichcausedmostconsternation when the book\\nfirstappeared .Thus,AlanWardecharacterised theapproach as\\n\\'highlyindeterminate\\' (1985, p. 199), andDavidHarvey, in the\\ncontextoftheSocietyand Space debate,wrote\\'Everysentence in\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabouris soladendownwith the rhetoricof 312SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncontingency , place,andthe specificity ofhistory,thatthe whole\\nguidingthreadofMarxian argument isreducedto a set of echoes\\nandreverberations ofinertMarxian categories\\' (1987, p. 373). I\\nhopeI have begun to demonstrate in the last section thatI do not\\nseeMarxist categories as inert. However , even if, given the fore\\xad\\ngoingsection,Iwanttoarguethatthebookis focused on explicitly\\ncapitalist socialrelations andthatitsapproach is clearly relatedto\\nhistorical materialism, it isnonethe lessevidently the casethatthe\\nexplanatory stanceadopted towards itsobjectofstudyis quite\\nspecific, anddifferent from much ofwhatisfoundunderthe\\nheading \\'Marxism\\'. \\'Contingency\\' and\\'specificity \\'therefore war\\xad\\nrantsomebriefdirectattention.\\nOutcomes and causes\\nProbably themostevident index of the approach adopted is the\\nattitudetakento therelationbetween the causal properties ofthe\\ncentraltheorised objectsofstudyon the one handandactual\\noutcomes on theother.It isnotassumed thatthere is any necessary\\ndirectcorrespondence between the two.\\nThis works bothways. On the one hand,the existence ofa\\nnumberofapparently similaroutcomes doesnotnecessarily imply\\nthatall are due to the same causalstructure .Therearenumerous\\nexamples ofthisthroughout thebook.Perhapsthemostsignificant\\nintermsoftheoverallstoryline ,apparently similarregional\\nemployment structures may in fact bothbe the result ofdifferent\\nprocesses and have distinctsocio-political implications (see, for\\ninstance, pp.112-13and167-9).Thus,thelargeamount of\\ndecentralisation of\\'jobsforwomen\\' to the regions ofthenorth\\nand west in the late sixties cannotall beexplained in terms ofthe\\nsamecausalstructure .Acceptance ofthisargument immediately\\nproblematises the way into analysis. Forprobably oneofthemost\\nfrequent stimuli to research is therecognition ofapattern:thatis, a\\nregularity ofoutcomes. Indeed,RoyBhaskar, in spiteofhisother\\narguments , hassuggested theidentification ofanempirical\\nregularity as thestarting-point forinvestigations (Bhaskar, 1978,\\npp. 163-6). Theimpetus, if onlyintuitively , is to find outwhat\\ncauses the pattern.Now,as-a place to start,observed patterns are\\nasacceptable asanything else, but it is important toremember that\\naregularpatterndoes not in itself imply any necessary consistency\\nofcause: in otherwords,no single or systematic cause may lie Reflections on Debates over a Decade 313\\nbehind it. The implication is not that one shouldnotstartfrom\\npatternsofoutcomes, but that it is important not to foreclose the\\nimmense possibilities of causal structure byassuming asingularity\\nof cause. A furtherimplication of course is that there are also many\\notherplaces to startininvestigations : thepotentially symptomatic\\ncase-study (judged to be so on the basis ofunderstanding already\\narrived at) is one clear alternative.\\nOn theotherhand, to reverse the argument, the existence ofa\\ncausalproperty does not guarantee adeterminate outcome on any\\ngivenparticular occasion. Thus, Section 3.3 (Spatial structures of\\nproduction andgeographical inequality) analyses the sources of\\nspatialdifferentiation which are integral to each of the types of\\nspatialstructure underinvestigation . Two axes of these sources of\\ndifferentiation areidentified :thoseto do with interregional\\nrelations (the social relations between spatially separated partsof\\nthe overall relations of production), and those to do with social\\nstructures in the\\'recipient\\' locales. However, the following section\\n(3.4, The uniqueness of place) then goes on to arguethatthe actual\\nimplications of any spatial structure cannotbe deduced from these\\npropositions alone(although knowledge ofthem will be necessary).\\nInparticular, stress is laid on the need to understand the impact of\\nspatialstructures as resulting from their combination with the\\nexisting character oftheareainquestion.Different existing\\ncharacters, different causalcombinations, mayresultindistinctly\\ndifferent outcomes. At this pointthe example of car plantsis used;\\nlater, in Chapter 5, the bulk of the chapteris given over to the\\nextended analysis of precisely this kind of variation resulting from\\nthe\\'combination of layers\\'. Thus \\'it is fruitless to examine the real\\nworld for an empirically-generalised outcome inordertosubstanti\\xad\\nate some inherentlogic. The internal necessity of a spatial structure\\ndoes not get \"actedout\"in the real world in pure form. Whattakes\\nplace is the interrelation ofthe new spatialstructure with the\\naccumulated results of the old. The \"combination\" of layers, in\\notherwords, really does mean combination, with each side of the\\nprocess affecting the other\\'(p. 117).\\nThis insistence on the lack ofnecessary conjunction between\\noutcome and cause runs throughout the book. Thus, in Section 4.3\\n(Clothing and footwear) there isa reflection on the survival ofsmall\\nfirms in those sectors. As in electronics such firms continue to form\\nanimportant presence. Some of the reasons for this similar result in\\ntwo such different partsof the economy are shared - for instance 314SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe lack of economies of scale in production. However, thatfact\\nitself is the result of highly contrasting processes (see pp. 149-52).\\nThis is an insignificant example,buriedwithinthe text but\\nnecessarily present because the broad principles of analysis laid\\nout in the early sections of the book must be put into practice\\nthroughout. Itis a small example, then, which should be seen as\\ncarrying out in practice and thereby emphasising a main theme,\\naboutthestructure of causality, which runs throughout the book\\nand which is manifested in a whole variety of different forms. It is\\noneofthe reasons for the complexity of the book (a pointremarked\\non byMarkusen, 1993).\\nIf, then \\'\\'\\'general laws\" are aboutcausation, not empirical\\ncorrelation\\' (p.116),their relation to empirical work is one of\\npossibility and, maybe, enablement ratherthan ofguarantee . Thus,\\nto give one example, \\'scientific management andFordism only\\nmake spatial separation ofcontrolandproduction possible. They\\ndo not, outside of particular circumstances, determine that it will\\nhappen\\'(p.25).There may be whole ranges of sets ofcircumstances\\nwhere scientific management andFordism are associated with the\\nspatialseparation ofproduction andcontrol, but there may also be\\nothers in which the possibility of geographical separation is not\\nrealised.\\nThis,however, raisesissuesabouttheevaluation ofany\\ninterpretation of causal structure. On what grounds, and to what\\nextent, can it be thoughtto be valid, sound, worthy of adoption? (I\\ndo not raise the terms \\'proofor\\'testing\\', since these seem to imply\\naneither/or, true/false dichotomy which is unwarranted.)\\nAs Saunders (1981)has argued, a formulation like the one above\\ncan make it impossible to evaluate empirically the usefulness ofthe\\nstatement \\'scientific management andFordism makespatial\\nseparation possible\\' if in any actualcase the result may be\\nseparation or notseparation, and if those very different outcomes\\ncan always beaccounted for by resort to the appropriate balance of\\ncircumstances acting for and against such separation .Itisnecessary\\nto push further, therefore. To begin with, ofcourse, the evaluation\\nofhypotheses aboutcausalstructures doesnotonly involve\\nempirical methods; it also importantly involves a constantly self\\xad\\nquestioning theoretical rigour. Moreover, and this point is perhaps\\nonly rarely made, the theoretical scepticism and the empirical\\nevaluation are not (or should not be) totally separate activities\\n(first let\\'s see if it\\'s internally consistent then let\\'s test it against the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 315\\ndata).The two can with great profitbetotallyinvolved with each\\nother,constantly provoking questions, throwing upproblems, the\\none for the other. This is one reasonwhy my own preference is\\noftento wrestle with theoretical problems in thelaboratory ofan\\nempirical case,ratherthansimply \\'in the abstract\\', as they say.\\nBut, given this, whatis thenatureoftheempirical evaluation?\\nFromtheargument aboveit would seem thatlarge-scale correla\\xad\\ntion-type exercises would not be the mosthelpful, since they give so\\nlittle access to causalstructures. At theotherendofthespectrum,\\nempirical testing in the regulated environment of a closed system is\\nnot possible in the kinds ofquestions at issue here. Itis, however,\\npossible to explorethepotential validityofhypotheses aboutcausal\\nstructures through thein-depth examination ofarangeof cases, in\\nwhich for instance andtoreturnto theaboveexample spatial\\nseparation didoccurin some and in othersnot. In Saunders \\'\\nterminology, itshouldindeed be possible to come up with some\\xad\\nthingalongthe lines of \\'counterfactuals\\' .Itis, forinstance, possible\\nandimportant to askunderwhatcircumstances thepostulated\\ntendency toseparation maynotoccur. (Someexamples ofthissort\\nofreasoning occurin theprevious chapters, although there is no\\nattempt there at systematic evaluation.) Suchspecifications of\\ncircumstances will never be purecounterfactuals: they can never\\nbe precise. Forinevitably there will beothercontingencies in play\\nandalwaysaccountmustbetakenofthevagaries of,andthe effect\\nof,humanintervention . This means thattheinvestigation should\\nnotbetempted intolaw-statements aboutoutcomes . Butwhatis\\npossible is an accumulation ofevidence, for andagainst;evaluation\\nas agradualprocess.\\nArticulation/ thinking in terms ofrelations\\nWe are, then, firmly into the realm of\\'multicausality\\' andagain\\nthere are numerous examples throughthebookwhere it is necessary\\ntodrawuponwholeconstellations ofprocesses, specified in relation\\nto class, to technological level, to genderrelations, andwith the\\nsignificance ofthespatialorganisation ofeachofthese processes\\nunderlined . A small buttypicalexample occursin theanalysisof\\ncertainstrategies withinthefootwear industry (see pp. 162-3),\\nwhere a satisfactory explanation couldnotbearrivedatwithout\\ndrawing uponanalysis from all these different directions .Each 316SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nprocess is in itself theoretically analysable (\\'necessary \\' maybe, in the\\ntermsofrealism) and each in principle could be theorised in terms\\nof its causal powers at a very general level (andremembering that\\nsuch powers /tendencies are themselves only \\'enabling\\' ratherthan\\ndeterminate ofanyparticular outcome), but their intersection, the\\ntermsoftheirintersection, and its results, are contingent. Again this\\ndoes not mean thattheoutcomes are totally indeterminate, in the\\nsensethatnothingcan beanticipated - even in the case ofhuman\\nagency the potential coursesofactionarefrequently restricted\\n(people are boxed-in, there is only bounded indeterminancy) . It\\nsimply implies thatin principle the outcome needs specificinvestiga\\xad\\ntion.\\nThis, however, is to go beyond the usual meanings ofmulti\\xad\\ncausality, which is a very flaccid term. Whatare at issue here are\\ncausalstructures in which processes intersect to impactupon each\\nother,to influence /encourage/restrain /mouldtheoperation ofeach\\nother. It is this which I think of, in a general form, as articulation.\\nIn this kind ofapproach tocausality, causescannotsimply be\\naddedtogether, as incertainformsofmultiple regression analysis,\\ntoapproach withmounting excitement a \\'significant\\' levelof\\nexplanation . A case ofthis kind ofcausalthinking ispresented in\\nrelation to thecentralquestion, for the book,of theimpactof\\nregional policy. Chapter 6, in the section on \\'Modernisation\\' takes\\nup the issue (seeespecially p. 234 et seq.),arguingthat\\'notonly did\\ntheeconomic roleofregional policy change over time, its impact\\nalso varied between sectors. Most obviously, it was simply more\\nimportant in some sectors than othersas afactorinlocational\\nchange. But more thanthis, regional policy combined indifferent\\nways indifferent industries withotherdevelopments takingplace at\\nthetime.Thewayitactually operated wasalsodifferent\\'\\n(pp. 240-1; and see also p. 166).\\nFurther, withinsuchcausalstructures theremay be some\\nprocesses which in a given instance are more important than\\nothers(forinstance by having more impacton theoperation of\\notherprocesses thanvice versa, or by determining theconditions of\\noperation ofotherprocesses). However, the fact, degree and nature\\nofsuchdominance can only be established by empirical enquiry,\\nand it can change from case to case. Itis not valid - in this view of\\ncausality - toassumethat,to take the favourite example, in the end\\nit will always be class which is dominant /determinant. (See for\\ninstance thediscussion oftheproposed necessity forspatial Reflections on Debates over a Decade 317\\ncentralisation [especiall y pp.46-7],ortheconclusions to the\\ndiscussion ofcharacterising capital[pp.28-30].)\\nThatlastexample (characterising capital) makesclearthatthis\\nnotionofarticulation appliesnotonlytostructures ofexplanation\\nbutalso to the very conceptualisation ofempirical phenomena . This\\nis oneaspectofamoregeneralapproach which I have tried to\\nadvocate andtopursuein thisbookandwhich may be called\\n\\'thinking in termsofrelations\\' .Thus,\\'jobs\\'(particular formsof\\nemployment) areconceptualised asparticular moments withinthe\\noverallrelations ofproduction , asfunctions setwithinanddefined\\ninarticulation with the wider set ofsocialrelations. It is this\\napproach whichconverts anunderstanding ofaparticular geogra\\xad\\nphicaldistribution ofemployment frombeingsimply a patternof\\njobstobeingaresultant whichindicates theformofspatial\\norganisation oftherelations ofproduction whichholdsthosejobs\\ntogether andofwhich they are phenomena. Thisapproach ,ofre\\xad\\ninterpreting \\'objectsinspace\\'asproducts ofthespatialorganisation\\nofrelations is at the heartoftheapproach ofthebookandwill be\\naddressed againinSection 8.5. But another example ofthis\\napproach, andwhich plays a key role in the book,isthatof\\n\\'branchplants\\' (see for instance, pp.104-6).Hereit isarguedthat\\n\\'it isimportant to getawayfromdiscussions ofapparently simple\\n\"objects\", andtoconceptualise processes andrelations . . .The\\nnotionof\"branch plant\" is agoodexample...Whatisimportant\\nis... toconceptualise thedifferent rolesbranchplantscan play in\\ntermsofthedifferent spatialstructures in which they are embedded\\nandthedifferent largerprocesses andrelations which they reflect\\'\\n(p. 104). Thinking ofbranchplantsin this way, it is arguedandI\\nhopedemonstrated, enables us todelineate anumber ofquite\\ndistinct forms,withcontrasting tendencies intermsoftheir\\npotential effects on inter-area relations, local social structures ,\\nandtheopportunities forandconstraints ontradeunionnegotia\\xad\\ntors(p. 104).\\nAt thispointthereare some particular arguments to pick up\\nwhich have been raised by commentators on thisapproach .Thus,\\nAllanCochrane, in a very thought-provoking exploration ofthe\\nformsofexplanation adopted inSpatialDivisions ofLabour,\\nadvanced the idea thatwhatisproposed in thebookis a form of\\n\\'micro-structuralism\\' (Cochrane , 1987). Whathe implies by this\\nterm is a structure ofexplanation which is constantly mademore\\ncomplex through disaggregation intosmallerandsmaller taxo- 318SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nnomicgroupsto eachofwhich is attached aparallelincrease in\\ncomplexity ofnecessary relations.Theexample he uses is thatof\\nindustry,with-the explanation ofnational orinternational capitalat\\nthehighest, leastdisaggregated, levelandsectors,subsectors and\\nfirms at increasingly specified levels beneath them. This interpreta\\xad\\ntion raises a rangeofimportant issues.\\nTo begin with, in the way I wish to arguethe case, specificity is\\nnotaquestion oftaxonomic disaggregation . Specificity is nota\\nproductofincreasing subdivision bypre-defined characteristics but\\naquestion ofthearticulation inanyone instanceofcriss-crossing\\naxesofcausality andinfluence .Thus,although inpreceding\\nchapters reference is frequently madetosubdivisions (which, I\\ncansee,doesgivetheimpression thatwhatisatissueis\\ndisaggregation), whensuchcategories arecited(\\'bigclothing\\nfirms\\', for example) thereasonsforcitingthis as a grouparenot\\nsomuch-orperhaps notbest seen as - criteriaforsystematic\\ndisaggregations (systematic inthesensethattheymightbe\\nconsistent eachwiththeothers) butaxes(typeofcapital,\\ntechnology/labour process,placein theeconomy) ofcomplex\\narticulations whichmaybedifferent in eachindividual case,but\\nwhich may (or maynot)also lead to systematic linesofdifferentia\\xad\\ntion intermsof, forinstance, sectors/subsectors.\\nNow,asCochrane says,one\\'spositions ontheseabstruse\\narguments aboutexplanatory structures haveimportant political\\nconsequences. Thisis a large partofthereasonwhy they matter:\\ndifferent arguments on this issue openupdifferent avenues for\\nintervention andforaction.On thisparticular debate, it seems to\\nmethattherearetwopointswhich it is important to stress.\\nFirst,Cochrane isconcerned thatamethodological focusofthis\\ntypemightreflect a shiftaway from attempts toconfront or\\nchallenge capitalat thenational orinternational levelsandmight\\nimplyinsteadanapproach \\'ona piecemeal basis: sectorbysector,\\ntype by type . . .\\' (p. 362). However this is to imply thatspecificity\\nonly lies at the disaggregated level;itimpliesthatcapitalat the\\nnational orinternational level issomehow purecapital.Yet in fact\\nthewiderlevels are - in termsofthemodeofconceptualisation - no\\nless specific thanis theindividual firm:international capitalin the\\nninetiesis verydifferent ftomin the fifties, say, andBritishcapital,\\nas isstressed repeatedly throughout thebook,isdistinct in its\\ncharacter fromothernational capitals. InordertotackletheBritish\\neconomy politically it isnecessary tounderstand boththe factofits Reflections on Debates over a Decade 319\\ncapitalist natureandthepeculiarities ofits wayofbeing so. What\\ntroubles Cochrane here inotherwordsismoretheconcern with\\ninternalvariation, with the local level andsoforth,the very fact of\\na focus on thatlevel,andless the methodological termsofthe\\nconstruction ofspecificity.\\nThesecond,related, concern isthatbecause \\'thereis . . . an\\nincreased stresson theuniqueness ofindividual firmsorcapitals.\\nEach type becomes effectively insulated fromtheother\\'(p. 361).\\nHereagainit may be thatthe issue is morethestressonindividual\\nfirmsper sethantheexplanatory approach adopted towards\\nuniqueness . It isconceptualisation andexplanation on which I\\namfocusing here.Fortheapproach which is suggested analytically\\ntoconstruct uniqueness is precisely one whichstresses, orattempts\\ntostress,connections ratherthanseparations. Animportant\\ncomponent oftheconstruction ofuniqueness isthearticulation of\\naxes some ofwhich will be sharedwith firms (forinstance) inquite\\ndifferent groupings orsubdivisionsoftheeconomy. Inthesections\\nonchanging spatialstructures (thebulkofChapter 4, forinstance),\\nthisapproach iswhatis being attempted .Itis for this reasonthat\\nthereareconstant references between thedifferent (e.g.sectoral)\\nstudies.Inthis way, for instance, twogroupsoffirms are shownto\\nbesimilar(they are bothcomposed, say,oflarge firms - they have,\\ntherefore, forexample bothspatialandpolitical muscle). On the\\notherhand,withintheindustrial contextofthedifferent sectorsthe\\nmeaning ofsize isdifferent in each case (its implications are\\ndistinct). Moreover, thesectorsmayoccupydifferent placeswithin\\ntheeconomy andthusbedifferently affected byshiftsin the\\nnational andinternational capitalist economies. A small example\\nofthiscanbefoundonpage152(paragraphs 2and4),butthe\\nprinciple runs throughout theargument. Itis aprinciple whichboth\\nallowsstrategic connections to bemadebetween different partsof\\ntheeconomy andlinksindividual firms/subsectors to themajor\\nstructures ofsociety, whether thatbepolitical powerorglobal\\neconomic movements .Inthis, itsharesa lot with currentdebates\\nabouttheconstruction ofpolitical identityandpolitical allegiances\\n(seeMassey, 1994).Farfrom being isolating, it is an attempt to\\nunderscore thelinkages whicharepartofwhatconstructs\\nindividuality.\\nToreturn,however, to themoredirectlymethodological issues:\\nCochrane arguesthatthe \\'types becomesonarrowly definedtotake\\naccountofeach new case that, in fact, theredonotseem to be any 320SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ngeneral rules - or necessary relations - at all. The dangeristhatan\\nempirical conjunction ofparticular events is transformed into a\\nnecessary relationship. If a new investment follows a different\\npatternthen new necessary relations are identified for a different\\ntypeoffirm\\' (p. 361). A preliminary caveat is here appropriate in\\nthat\\'general rules\\' (in the sense of empirically-generalisable out\\xad\\ncomes) are not the same as necessary relations. More centrally,\\nhowever, it has to be agreed thatthereissuch adanger,thoughit is\\nnotwhatisbeing argued for here. Norisit adangerconfined to any\\nparticular approach . In the last section (8.2) the habitofassuming\\nretrospectively thatwhat did happenhad tohappenissharply\\ncriticised (the example being thatof theprogression fromFordism\\ntosomething else). And certainly, as alsoarguedin the last section,\\noutcomes are notimmediate indications of\\'necessary character\\xad\\nistics\\'.Throughout thebookthere are numerous warnings precisely\\nagainsttaking empirical outcomes as giving direct and unproble\\xad\\nmatical access to necessary causal powers. However, it has to be\\naddedthatif indeed \\'a new investment\\' does follow \\'a different\\npattern\\'then, ifthatis a difference in which we are interested , the\\ntask will indeed be to build an accountofits causal structure which\\ndoes recognise thatvariation .\\nFinally,moreover, allofthis as is constantly stressed, all ofthese\\naxesofarticulation, do not arrive raw at the factory gate. They\\nhave to be interpreted by the actors involved, they have to be\\nunderstood ;and the way thathappens will vary, and have effects.\\nOtherrelated issues were raised by a groupofsociologists at\\nLancaster University in the late 1980s,who over a period ofyears\\nengaged with, developed and elaborated many of the ideas in\\nSpatialDivisions ofLabour.2They were also working within a\\nframework which tried to combine someofthe insights ofMarxism\\nand critical realism. It is in thatcontextthattwoclarifications are\\nworthmakingat thispoint.Theybothconcern thestructure of\\nexplanations .\\nThe first pointis at first sight trivial but it has provided for me,\\nover the years, one of the clearest examples bothof how works have\\na lifeoftheir own (they are actively read as wellas actively written)\\nandofthe power ofrhetoric in its widest (and not derogatory)\\nsense. In his influential writing in this area a member ofthe\\nLancaster group,AlanWarde,tookup the idea ofthe specificity\\noflocal economies, and indeed ofunevendevelopment more widely,\\nbeingconstructed outofthesuperimposition andcombination of Reflections on Debates over a Decade 321\\nsuccessive roundsofinvestment; hedubbed it\\'anextended\\nmetaphor ofthegeology ofsocialrelations\\' (Warde, 1985,\\np. 191).\\'The metaphor\\', he writes, \\'is geological; successive rounds\\nofaccumulation depositlayersofindustrial sediment ingeographi\\xad\\ncal space\\' (Warde, 1985,pp. 196-7). Ithad a nice ring to it, it was a\\nquickwayofreferring to thenotionoflayers,it was used\\nextensively by the Lancaster groupin theirpublications; itspread\\nand became accepted. The automatic modeofreference became:\\nMassey\\'s geological metaphor .\\nNow, Alan Wardein no way meantthis negatively andindeed he\\nwent on to use and develop the said metaphor. Noris this an\\nargument againstmetaphors - they are a necessary partofour\\nmeans of thinking. However the popularacceptance ofthis view of\\nwhat I was doing- thisparticular metaphor -andthe way that\\nsubsequent authorssimply copied it into their own articles, caused\\nme no little discomfort. Foritdidn\\'t, anddoesn\\'t, reallycapture\\nwhatI was trying to get at. The basic definition to which Warde\\nrefers (p. 197; it is to Massey, 1979, pp. 234-5) makes no mentionof\\ngeology and in my own writings I have only found one hint,in\\nChapter3ofthisbookwhere I refer to sedimentation andstrata. Be\\nthat as it may, geology is notanappropriate wayofenvisaging the\\nlayering process I had in mind. Forit reduces the fluidity, the\\nrelational nature,andthefundamental processes ofmutual\\ninteraction andmoulding which I wantedto convey. Surely the\\nnotionofthecombination oflayers is very ungeological. In the\\ngeological version only the sedimentation and the (differential)\\nsubsequent erosionarecaptured. Whatis missed includes most\\nimportantly the factthatthe layers themselves are constructed in\\npartoutofsocialrelations, networks ofinterconnections across\\nspace, and the fact that- crucially - they interact. And they interact\\nbothinmoulding thecharacter the one oftheotherandin\\nproducing , inconsequence , radical differences in anyone layer\\nbetween different areas.\\nThey also interact through activehumanagency. Places are\\nemphatically not to be conceptualised as \\'thevictimsofcapital\\'\\n(Bagguley et al.,1990, p. 2, emphasis in original). But this raises a\\nsecond issue. Bagguley et al.(1990) write oftheapproach : \\'we have\\npreviously dubbedthis the\"geological metaphor\", describing as it\\ndoes the ways in which these divisions oflabouroverlie each other\\ntoconstitute distinctregions and localities\\' (p. 2) - it is a clearcase\\nof the use ofthe geological image being associated with a lack of 322 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nattention tointeraction andcombination . However in their own\\nwork the Lancaster group,unlike others who went on to adoptthe\\nmetaphor, do payconsiderable attention to these issues. The way in\\nwhich they do so, however, is interesting. In a numberofplaces\\nthey call for \\'rulesofcombination\\'. Thus:\\'Itis then necessary to\\ndetermine the rules ofcombination between variousclass residues\\nin any place, since different combinations willproduce different\\npolitical effects\\'(Warde, 1985, p. 199). This is consistent with a\\nmore general approach ofthisgroup,which seeks such rules of\\ncombination , ortransformation rules, in shifts between spatial\\ndivisions oflabourover time (p. 198), within labourmarkets\\n(p. 205), and between struggles over production andconsumption\\n(p. 209) (see also Bagguley et al.,1990).3 I am doubtful aboutthe\\nnatureand validity ofthis project. First,as they themselves point\\nout, the multiplicity ofpotential combinations isenormous , even\\nwhen one startsfrom only a fewelements. There seems to me to be\\nnopointin the kind of exercise which ends up with \\'well over\\n100,000\\' possible com binations (Shapiro, 1987,cited in Bagguley et\\nal.):the main message to be drawnis indeed the complexity ofthe\\nanalytical task inhand.And Bagguley et al.are right to pointout\\nthatthis\\'shouldmake it clear how problematic it is toappealto a\\n\"logicofaccumulation \" asaccounting for an observed empirical\\ntrend\\'(p. 9).\\nBut what does thatmean for the call for rules ofcombination ?\\nOn the one handit is easily possible to generate so many thatthe\\ntask becomes unmanageable, but if on the otherhandtoo few\\nelements are analysed theircombination is likely to be such a small,\\norunderspecified, partofanyactualempirical situation thatits\\ncontribution couldbebothminimal and anyway overridden. This,\\nit seems to me, poses a real issue for an approach such as realism\\nwhich aims to take seriously boththe need for theory and the\\nrecognition ofcomplexity (it isofcourse no dilemma at all for those\\napproaches which refuse to see the complexity in the first place).\\nBut a call for \\'rules\\'is no way out. The problem indicated above\\nresults from the fact thatwhat we are dealing with are open\\nsystems, and this open natureofsocial systems has to be faced\\ndirectly. Neither\\'extreme\\' solution isavailable , even in principle.\\n(The systems cannotbeclosed for experimental purposes norcan all\\npossible outcomes be specified.) The best approach seems to be\\nalong the lines suggested in the discussion above ofevaluation and\\nofcounterfactuals .Fornotalloutcomes areequally likely, Reflections on Debates over a Decade 323\\nempirical understandings can be built up which will bothfeed\\nback into theoretical understanding and guide the structuring of\\nfutureempirical work. But there is a furtherproblem in the\\nformulation in terms of \\'rules\\'. Thus, at the end ofoneofhis\\narticlesWardesuggests \\'thatanysatisfactory account ofthe\\ngeologyofsocialrelations\\' should satisfy certaincriteria.The first\\nofthese asks for \\'transformation rules\\' which account for the\\nstructuring ofindustrial layers over time in a given area. \\'Second\\',\\nsuch an account \\'should be able to specify determinately the\\npolitical outcomes contingent upondifferent kindsoflocalised\\nsystemsofsocialrelations. This would entail being able to classify\\nthe typical effects ofdifferent combinations ofclass, gender and\\npopular forces\\'(Warde, 1985,p.209).This, it seems to me, is a\\nrequirement which it is in principle impossible to satisfy. Notonly\\ndo the meanings and contentofsuch terms as class and gender vary\\nradically between cultures and historical periods(though in his\\nfourthand final requirement , Warde asks thatthere is sufficient\\nelaboration and specification \\'topermitreconnection with historical\\nevidence\\' [po210]),but also this kind of notionof rules really does\\nput inquestion any effectivity ofagency.Itseems to be asking for a\\ndeterminism ofconsciousness . Actors always interpret their situa\\xad\\ntions, and do so with an ever-changing arrayofinterpretive\\nmaterials .Bourdieu (1977)has aptly commented on this kind of\\ndebate, neatly linking the call for rules with the chaoticmultiplicity\\nofpotential outcomes :\\'Itis necessary to abandon all theories which\\nexplicitly or implicitly treatpractice as amechanical reaction,\\ndirectly determined by theantecedent conditions andentirely\\nreducible to the mechanical functioning ofpre-established assem\\xad\\nblies, \"models\" or \"roles\" - which one would, moreover , have to\\npostulate ininfinitenumber\\' (p. 73). IndeedBagguley etat.\\nconfront this issue themselves in one oftheir studies ofLancaster\\n(pp.187-8).\\nYetwhatwearefacedwith is complexity, notinherent\\nindeterminancy in the sense thatalloutcomes are equally likely,\\northatno general statements can be made. Again, even in the case\\nofhumanagency, there are practical limits on what a person can do\\nand the range ofbeliefsthey can act on. Itispossible to unearthby\\nin-depth analysis key causalrelations, including combinations,\\nwhich may be replicated, even dominant, innumbers ofsitua\\xad\\ntions.Itisperhaps thisapproach ,ratherthanaformulation of\\nrules, which will be most productive. 324 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAfinalnote on variety and specificity\\nThereis no necessary relation, then, between a thoroughgoing\\nrecognition ofvariation and specificity on the one handand a\\nretreatinto\\'description \\' orempiricism on the other.Thereis more\\nthatone can do with the uniquethan simply contemplate it (p. 116).\\nApartfrom the fact that\\'description\\' must always anyway be\\ntheory-dependent, what is at issue, perhaps, is more the nature\\nand role oftheoretical work. \\'General laws\\' are aboutcausation,\\nconnection, interdependence - andtherefore conceptualisation - not\\nempirical correlation (p. 116). Indeed, from the pointofviewofthe\\napproach adopted in this work, it would be bettertoabandon\\ncompletely theterms\\'description\\' and\\'laws\\'in thiskindof\\ndiscussion. The role oftheoretical work is in the conceptualisation\\nofobjectsofstudy,in thetheorisation ofcausalpowersand\\nrelations, in theestablishment offrameworks, themselves not as a\\nsetofimmutable tendencies but more as a way oflookingat the\\nworld (Sayer, 1984). Indeed the recognition ofbothvariety and\\nspecificity islinked up to particular theoretical approaches, or forms\\nofexplanation.

This is an answer which might emerge\\nfrommanyastrandofpostmodernist thought.

This is true bothin the sense ofwhat isimportant to\\nexamine and in the sense thatthe very construction ofdifference\\nrelies on an understanding ofbroaderstructures.

Yet 326SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nrecognising specificity does not in any way anyway imply a\\nconcentration on local politics in the sense usually understood ; a\\nfocus,thatis, on very small-scale actions.

Ratherthan as scatterings of isolated\\nphenomena, thesedistributions were to be conceptualised as the\\ninterconnected phenomena of social relations stretched out to form\\na space. The aim was thatthis should enable us to think the politics\\nof place and uneven development in a different way.\\nThereis a sequence of steps in this reconceptualisation of\\neconomic space. The first, and the one which is usually omitted\\nthereby leading to an inability to perform the others, is to take\\nseriously the conceptualisation of the object of study (say,jobs and\\ntypes of jobs).As with capitalas a class (see above)these\\nphenomena with which industrial geography conventionally deals\\nare rarely seriously considered in their natureas objects of study.\\nYet one of the crucial lessons of Marxism, for instance, for work in\\nthis area is to recognise things as constituted by relations: capital is\\narelation, thevarious classesin asocietyareconstituted\\nrelationally with each other, and so forth. Likewisejobs and types\\nofjobs: they are phenomena of different positions within the overall\\ncomplexity of the social relations ofproduction ; the existence and Reflections on Debates over a Decade 327\\nspecificity ofone type ofjob(say, specialist manager) depends on\\nthe existence and specificity ofjobsdesigned to do otherpartsof\\nthe overall division oflabour.Oneoftheattractions ofWright\\'s\\nframework was the detail with which he had begun to think this\\nthrough.Moreover hisframework not only analyses occupational\\nfunctions but links them to class position, inparticular tointra\\xad\\nclassvariations (though I disagreed then, and continue to do so,\\nwith many of the conclusions he drew from his approach). Thus\\nwhat was immediately possible was a linking oftheconceptualisa\\xad\\ntionofjobsin terms ofrelations with an analysis ofelements of\\nclass, between thatisindustrial geography and the geography of\\nsocialstructure.\\nIf, then, a particular managerial job,say, can be conceptualised\\nas a setoffunctions bothspecified by and existing in relationto\\notherjobswithin the economy, then the next step is to think ofthis\\nspatially.Insteadof, say, different types of jobseach with their own\\n(same or different) geographical distribution there are different sets\\nofinterdependent functions held togetherin tension by sets ofsocial\\nrelations stretched out between them. Uneven development is then\\nan issue ofthegeography ofthatdivisionoflabourandofthe\\nsocial relations ofproduction , and not merely ofmore or different\\njobs/investment here than there; a \\'core\\'region is not just,or even\\nnecessarily, the one with all the bestjobs, or even the most jobsin a\\nparticular sector, say, but the one from which run the dominant\\nlinesofcontrol, ofstrategic direction, ofcrucialconnections; a\\nspatialstructure ofproduction (as in this book) is not a distribution\\nofjobsbut ageography ofsocial relations. Thinking in terms of\\nrelations startsfrom the interdependence ofphenomena and thus of\\nthe spaces they construct: this applies to jobswithin a division of\\nlabour(see, for instance, p. 206)and to regions within an economy.\\nWhatis at issue is the spatial form ofcertainaspectsofsocial\\npower.Moreover, this matters: \\'Itmattersin what kind of spatial\\nstructure aplantisembedded .Itmattersin terms ofthe kind of\\nrelations ofdominance andsubordination which exist between\\nplants in different localities, it mattersfor the people who work\\nin the plants, and it matterspolitically\\' (p. 104). Thinking in terms\\nof relations gives access to causality.\" It enables a more robust\\napproach to theconstitution and reproduction ofthe space ofa\\ncertain set ofsocial relations.\\nOne of the most crucial developments which has taken place, in\\nthe UK and most otherfirst world countries, in the decades since 328SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nthe sixtieshas been the expansion and consolidation of white-collar\\nmiddle-income professional and managerial strata. The size and\\npower of this group has become a stubborn fact of social structure,\\na vital stake in the play of politics, and - I would argue, as do the\\npreceding chapters - oneofthe most important (andprobably\\nimplacable) problems facing any attempt to work towards less\\nuneven forms of spatial development.\\nAs groups they have emerged from the more detailed structuring\\nandseparating-out offunctions within the division of labour,and\\nthe relations in which they exist with other groups are often ones\\nwhich give them considerable power. Different sub-groups within\\nthem have been lionised by successive governments and political\\nrhetorics. Moreover, and on top of all this, they have a very\\nparticular geography. Itis a geography of both concentration and\\nprivilege. Their distribution is quite highly focused in particular\\nareas of the country, as previous chapters show (and although I am\\nspeaking here of the UK, the same is true of many if not most first\\nworld countries). And these are parts ofthecountrywhich tend to\\nbe already privileged, whether thatbe the capital city, at a regional\\nlevelthesoutheasternpartof thecountry,or more locally the areas\\nof perceived environmental attraction . Classically, they are to be\\nfound far less in areas dominated by blue-collar manufacturing, in\\ntheindustrial areas of the north,in localities which are in decline.\\nThere is a two-sidedness to this distribution. Policy-makers often\\nargue that the presence of such groups is a reason for the health of\\nthe areas in which they live; and the conclusion is drawn that\\nattracting white-collar professionals into areas of decline would\\nhelp them grow too. But while there is some truthin this as an\\nobservation the causal conclusions drawn are in an important sense\\nthe wrong way around.It is even more the case thatthese social\\ngroupsaboundinparticular areasbecausethey are healthy. The\\nsocial power of these groups (for instance, their bargaining power\\nwithin the labourmarket) givesthem a power of choice of location,\\nwhich may be fed throughtheperception of their preferences by the\\ncompanies which seek their labourpower. And they exercise that\\npower overwhelmingly to avoid the physical and social environment\\nof decline (perhaps the only exception, though it still replicates this\\npatternat a much smaller spatial scale,is thatofgentrification). But\\nwhat this means is thatthese groups use their social power to\\nreinforce theirprivilege through location. Andthatinturn\\nexacerbates the unevenness of uneven development. Reflections on Debates over a Decade 329\\nSuchgroupsfigure largely in the analyses ofthisbook,andthe\\nattemptto get to grips with them from a geographical perspective is\\naclearexample ofboththemethodand theadvantages of\\'thinking\\nin terms ofrelations\\' - asappliedbothto these groupsthemselves\\nandto the spaces they create.Fromthebeginning thegroupsare\\nconceptualised intermsofWright\\'s classframework. Thatis to say,\\nthey are interpreted asperformers offunctions withintheoverall\\ndivision ofpaidlabour:this is the aspectoftheirclassposition\\nwhich isofinterest(thoughas isstressedtherelations ofproduction\\nby nomeansprovidea fullaccountoftheirsocialcharacter). A first\\nthingwhich emerges from this approach is acleardifferentiation\\nwithin the groupas a whole. In the analyses here it is the broad\\nlinesofoneofthesedistinctions on which attention is focused: the\\ndistinction between managerial strataandcertainprofessional\\nstrata,particularly thosein scientific andresearch occupations.\\nTheinitialdistinction between thesesubgroups emerges by\\nexamination oftherelations ofproduction, withinwhich they are\\ndifferently placed.Managerial strataareconcerned withthe\\nrelations ofeconomic ownership andpossession andplacedon\\nthedimension ofthe class framework between proletariat and\\nbourgeoisie, while scientific andresearch workers arepartofa\\ndivisionoflabourwithinproduction whicharticulates thefunctions\\ncommonly referredto asconceptualisation (heremainlyintermsof\\nthetechnical product) andexecution ,andareplacedonthe\\ndimension ofthe class framework between proletariat andpetty\\nbourgeoisie (see, for instance, Figures2.1, 3.1andespecially 3.5).\\nThesetwosubgroups , inotherwords,whichmightin some ways\\nlooksimilar,andhaveindeedinindustrial geography oftenbeen\\nundifferentiated, in factperform different functions withinthe\\noveralldivisionoflabourandhavequitedifferent locations within\\nthe class structure (see, for instance, pp.37-8,109and221).Each\\nhasdistinctrelations with otherintra-class groups.Moreover , this\\ndifferent socialplacingis reflected in the ratherdifferent geogra\\xad\\nphiesofthe twogroups(seeChapter 4andpp.277-8forinstance)\\nand in the forms ofgeographical inequality in which they are\\nimplicated .\\nTheargument here links up with morerecentworkon the\\ncomposition of\\'themiddleclass\\'.ThusSavageandhiscolleagues\\nwhodrawonratherlaterworkby Eric Olin Wrightthanthatused\\nhere come up with quitesimilarlinesofdistinction (Savageet al.,\\n1992;Wright, 1985). They too stress thatthe key distinction is 330SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nbetweenmanagers andprofessionals (thoughinSpatialDivisions of\\nLabouronly a small range ofprofessionals, mostparticularly\\nscientists and researchers, was considered in detail).5 Whatthe\\npreceding chapters alsopointto, however, isthe differential rates of\\nnumerical growth of these subgroups between different historical\\nperiods, in this case since the sixties. Moreover these historically\\nvarying rates of growth are not synchronised between the two\\ngroups. There is clearly a whole range offactors in play here,\\namongthem both technological developments (which may enable\\ntheseparation-out and definition of distinct functions) and, most\\nparticularly, thenatureof the ruling national politico-economic\\nstrategy. The mix of the middle class which established itselfunder\\nHaroldWilson, for example, was very different from that which\\nflourished underMargaret Thatcher .Thishas anumber of\\nimplications .Itindicates thatthenatureand extent of intergenera\\xad\\ntional mobility - and variations in such mobility between different\\npartsof the middle class - will vary over time. Itpoints to a\\n(further) potential basis for different politics between the groups. It\\nindicates thatthegeography of the middle class will have shifted in\\ndifferent ways over time, and that therefore the forms of spatial\\ninequality in which they are embedded willlikewisehave changed in\\nrelativeimportance. Forit is clear thatthe various sections ofthis\\nclass have been caughtup in very different dynamics, both spatially\\nand socially, between generations.\\nThe analysis in the preceding chapters also shares with Savage et\\n01.a concern with the geographical articulation of these groups, and\\nsome similar conclusions emerge. There is agreement on the crucial\\nlineofdifferentiation between the south-east and the rest ofthe\\ncountry, although what emerges from the preceding chapters isthat\\nthe linearoundthesouth-east should not be tightly drawnand\\ncertainly should not be restricted to the area oftheStandard\\nRegion. Massey, Quintas and Wield (1992) also provide some\\nsupport, thoughagain only in relation to high-tech professionals,\\nfor the recent blurring of theboundaries betweenmanagerial and\\nprofessional groups within the south-east. But the wider evidence\\nsuggests thateven inthatregion the distinction between the two\\ngroupsis stillnotablebothsocially and geographically . Indeed the\\nanalysis here would stress even more stronglythe way in which the\\nspatiality ofthesegroupsis integral to their formation .Ithas\\nalreadybeen seen thatthe different placing of these groups in terms\\nof the social relations ofproduction enables them to adoptrather Reflections on Debates over a Decade 331\\ndifferent geographical distributions .Whatis at issue now is a\\nreverse effect, from the spatialto the social. Itcanhappenin two\\nways. First, justasdevelopments within the technology andthe\\nsocialrelations ofproduction enabled(onlyenabled; they did not\\ndetermine) theseparation-out ofthesegroupsbothsocially and\\nspatially, sospatialseparation was acondition ofthedevelopment\\nofcertainaspectsofthe division oflabour.Thus,oftheseparation\\nofeconomic ownership from possession and the development of\\ncomplex hierarchies within each it is arguedthat\\'thedevelopment\\nandincreasing complexity of these relations took place over space\\nand in a geographically differentiated context. Multi-locationality\\nitself, as much as the increasing sizeoffirms (the only thing usually\\nreferred to) must have been important inproducing the need for\\nsuchhierarchies andininfluencing the forms which they have taken\\nand the kinds of division oflabourwhich have developed within\\nthesefunctions .\"Geography\" has been an essential constructive\\nelement in their development\\' (p. 69).Or again \\'Spatialstructure , in\\notherwords, is an active element in accumulation .Moreover,\\nprecisely because geographical form can influence the rate of\\naccumulation, it may well be thatoneoftheconditions for the\\ndevelopment ofparticular kinds of technical division oflabour\\nwithinproduction in the first place is the existence ofparticular\\nkinds of geographical differentiation , forinstance in thelabour\\nmarket.Inotherwords, it is not only that\"thedifferent stages in\\nthe technical division oflabouraredistinguished bylocationally\\nrelevant characteristics\" and are therefore spreadoutindifferent\\nlocations. It is also thatthe very existence ofsuch differences\\nbetween lo cationsmay be a stimulus to thedevelopment ofa\\ntechnical division oflabourwhich enables advantage to betakenof\\nthem\\'(p. 72).Whatthis ispushingtowardsis somereformulation\\noftheexplanation ofthedevelopment ofmanagerial hierarchies\\n(andofparticular formsoftechnical division oflabourand so\\nforth)whichallowsexplicit recognition ofthedifferentiated\\ngeography which is not only the contextin which they develop\\nbut which may also be partoftheprovocation totheirdevelopment\\nin the first place and to their particular form. Second, once in their\\nparticular geographical locations thespatialenvirons in which they\\nliveare likely to have furthereffects upon the social natureofthese\\ngroups, maybe even being specifically used to thateffect (see\\nMassey, Quintas and Wield, 1992, on location andstatusamong\\nscientists in high-technology companies) through the influence of 332SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nspatialdistancing, socialcontext, ormobility, forinstance (see\\npp.143-4).\\nFinally, conceptualising these social groups, andtheirspatial\\ndistributions, intermsofthesocialrelations ofclasshelps\\nreformulate thequestions which arise for the labourmovement\\nfromtheirunevengeographies: itchanges thepolitical analysis.For\\nthese highly unequal geographies presuppose thestretching outover\\nspaceofsocialrelations whichembody greatpower,ofdirection\\nandcontrolin the case ofmanagerial hierarchies, andofstrategic\\nvisionandextreme inequality inrelation to thelabourprocess,\\nespecially in thecaseofscientific /professional workers.These\\naspectsareadditional to themoreimmediately evidentinequal\\xad\\nities,ofincomeforinstance.Whatisat issue is boththespatiality of\\nthisformofpower(andspatialformmaybepartofthe\\nconstruction ofthatpower)andtheconstruction ofapower-filled\\nspace.

At a quite concrete\\nlevel, this approach can influence the way in which place /locality/\\nregion is thoughtabout.Notonly are \\'localities\\' the productof the\\narticulation ofsocialrelations at a wide range ofgeographical\\nscales, but they are con stantlybeing formed and transformed (see,\\nforinstance, pp.188-9and289).Section5.2(The coalfield areas,\\np.188)examines this phenomenon ,ofthereorientation ofa whole\\nregion in terms ofits role within a wider space andoftheinternal\\nspatialreworking which goes alongwiththat.As is said ofthe\\nregionalgeography ofthe period as a whole \\'even the shape ofthe\\nmap has been refashioned \\' (p.288).\\nHowever , if this map is to be conceptualised in terms ofsocial\\nrelations existing between economic functions /socialgroupswhich\\naremutually defining in relationto a division oflabour, then some\\nspecification ofthe overall labourto beperformed is necessary. In\\ndetail this will always be impossible . Since \\'the totalwork to be\\nperformed\\' itself has to be defined socially, the system is almostby\\ndefinition to some degree open. Nonethe less, there are two\\nimportant ways in which the empirical, and in one ofthe cases\\nalso the theoretical , analyses in SpatialDivisions ofLabourcan be\\nextended here. Both of them are highlighted bycurrentdevelop\\xad\\nments. 334SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThefirstconcerns unpaidlabour.Wright\\'s framework istypical\\nofapproaches to theanalysisofclass in thatitdealsexclusively\\nwithpaidlabour(indeedinsomeways it has to be stretched to deal\\nwith allofthat).Andthepreceding chapters,notwithstanding some\\nclearrecognitionofthe issue (Elaborations ,p. 39), went alongwith\\nthat.Now, theconcept ofspatialdivision oflabourwasnever\\nmeant, bymyselfat least, to encompass unevendevelopment in\\neverysphereoflife. Inthatsense I have somereservations about\\nattempts toextendit toincludewideareasofcivilsociety, for\\ninstance, andall the issues ofwhatissometimes called\\'reproduc\\xad\\ntion\\' (see, for instance, Warde, 1985) although. andthis is an\\nimportant caveat, anyfullunderstanding ofthereasons for\\nparticular spatialstructures /spatialdivisions oflabourforinstance\\nmustinevitably lookmorewidely - as the preceding chapters to\\nsomeextentdo - at social relations andprocesses beyondtheworld\\nofemployment. Sotoo, evenmorecrucially, mustanyfullanalysis\\nofclasspositions. Nonethe less, the focus ofconcern ofthe\\nconcepts spatialstructure /spatialdivisionoflabouris the space of\\npaidwork,andit is soquitedeliberately.\\nHowever ,thereis amethodological problem with this restriction .\\nFor,given some broadnotionofthelabourto beperformed in a\\nsocietyatanyhistorical period, theboundary between thatwhichis\\nperformed aspaidworkandthatwhich is unpaidwillnotbe\\ndeterminate. Itwill vary between social classes, between regions,\\nbetween different typesofhouseholds (nuclear, singlepeople, etc.)\\nand-crucially -overtime. In manycountries overthe lastdecade\\ntherehas been a decisive shift,through cutsinpublicexpenditure\\nandpublicservices, orstructural adjustment programmes inthird\\nworldcountries forinstance,ofcertaintypesofworkfrompaid\\nemployment towards theunpaidsector.Whatthismeansisthatthe\\noverall\\'system\\'ofpaidworkisundefined andthattherefore the\\nmutually-determining natureofthedifferent elements withinit is\\nlesssecure.Thustheframework ofspatialdivisions oflabour, the\\nconceptualisation ofjobsasmutually-defining interdependent\\nfunctions ,couldimportantly beextended toencompass those\\nvariable processes through which the paid/unpaid boundary is\\nconstructed andwhichwillvaryfromthepolitico-economic\\nactivities oftheState,thevarying characteristics anddemands\\n(bothmaterial andsymbolic) ofdifferent typesofpaidemployment,\\ninherited andchanging formulations offemininity andmasculinity\\nto, forinstance, negotiations withinthehousehold .PQuiteapart Reflections on Debates over a Decade 335\\nfrom all the manyotherreasonsforstudying thisinterface, this\\nparticular entryinto theareaunderlines from yet anotherangle the\\ninterdependence ofthe paid and unpaidsectorsofsociety.\\nThereis afurtherway in which the formulation ofelements of\\ndivisions of labourinpreceding chapters has left the overall\\'labour\\'\\nunderspecified . Here there is no tight exclusion, as there was of\\nunpaidlabour,butneitheris there a clear specification. The focus\\nofSpatial Divisions ofLabouris onnational (andfirst world,\\ncapitalist) economies, andagainthis was deliberately so: the\\nconcern was with intra-national divisions oflabour. Nonethe\\nless, such economies areoftenvery open in terms oftrade.They\\nare set in systems ofproduction which go beyondthem. They are,\\ntherefore, concomitantly embedded indivisions oflabour.and\\nspatialstructures ofproduction which also go beyondthem. This\\ntoocouldhave been moredeveloped in thepreceding chapters (as a\\nnumberofreviewers pointedout).The results ofsuch anextension\\nwould be twofold (at least). It would underline therelations of\\ndomination andsubordination which the variouspartsoftheUK\\'s\\n(oranyothercountry\\'s) economic structure andthevarious\\nlocalities have with otherpartsoftheworld.Anditwould\\nhighlight thegreatdifferences whichexist in theserelations\\nbetween geographical areas. Thislatterissue has become increas\\xad\\ninglyimportant, certainly in the UK, over the last decade.Inmany\\neconomies regions are now clearly embedded in very different\\ninternational spatialstructures; inthatsense there is an increased\\nfracturing ofnational economies. In theUnitedKingdom, for\\ninstance, thestarkcontrast is between the southandeastofthe\\ncountryand thenorthand west. In the south-east agoodnumberof\\nthedominant elements exist inrelations ofcomparative controlin\\nrelationtootherpartsof theinternationalised spatialstructures in\\nwhich they are embedded . This is the case, for instance, in finance,\\nincertainprofessional services, in aspects ofhigh-technology, in\\nmultinational companies inbothservicesandmanufacturing, and\\nso on. The position ofthese activities within the international\\neconomic hierarchies is not as dominant as in some cases it used to\\nbe,noris suchdominance typical of all partsofthesouth-east\\neconomy. But it is an important and,I would argue,structurally\\ncharacterising, element. The relation of thenorthandwest to\\ninternationalised spatialstructures is verydifferent. Theirpresent\\npositions, andtheir likely futures, within the international division\\noflabouraresharplycontrasting . 336SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThere isa furtherissueraised by the generalisation ofthe concept\\nof space as social relations, and which again reflects back on the\\nargument of the preceding chapters.The strong, and still important,\\narguments of the seventies and eighties thatspace is socially\\nconstituted andthat,conversely, the social necessarily has a spatial\\ncontent/form had a tendency in much work to remain at the levelof\\nslogans. The precise ways in which these statements were true, and\\ntheir implications, were less often ferretted out. SpatialDivisions of\\nLabourspells out in some detail the natureofsome of these\\nrelations and mechanisms, but itdoes so for only a limited range\\nof thepotential formsofsocial spatiality. In partthis is simply\\nbecause its remit is limited - it is concerned only with thatlimited\\nbit of societyengaged by industrial geography. But evenwithin that\\nitsprimaryconcern is with one kind of social relation over space:\\nthatofrelatively orderedspatialstructures within firms.\\nThepointaboutorderedspatialstructures within companies is\\nthatthey represent only one kind of relationship between the social\\nand the spatial. They are, in a sense, \\'planned spaces\\'; their spatial\\narrangement is to one degree or anotherdeliberate: it is partofthe\\nconstitution of thestructure itself. The relationship between a\\nheadquarters and a set of otherlocations (regional headquarters,\\nproduction branch plants of various functions,etc.) isan element of\\nwhat might becalled orderedspatiality. Moreover, the natureof this\\njointsocial-spatial ordering has implications - the spatial form is\\nprecisely meantto have social effects, to increase profits by location\\naccording to differential criteria, to undermine workers\\' bargaining\\xad\\npower by multi-sourcing at a number of disparate places, and so\\nforth (which is not to say thatit does not have other, unforeseen,\\neffectsaswell).This isone kind ofwayinwhich \\'geography matters\\'.\\nHowever, there are otherkinds of economic relations which\\ncontribute to theconstitution of the spaces of industrial geography.\\nChief among theseare marketrelations betweenfirms, and these are\\nfar less considered in the preceding chapters.\\'Thenatureof the\\nconnection between the social and the spatial in marketrelations\\ncan vary greatly. In some cases the natureof the firm and its\\nlocationrelative to others can be intimately linked: the two things\\nmay beplannedtogether. Inothercases,already-established firms\\nmay set up marketrelations becauseofa spatial propinquity which\\noccurred for otherreasons altogether. There are also cases, of\\ncourse, where neither plannednormarketrelations exist. Thatis,\\nthere are activities and groups which are mutually indifferent in Reflections on Debates over a Decade 337\\nsocial terms, but which none the less necessarily exist in spatial\\nrelationto eachother.Their relative locations are alsopartofwhat\\nconstructs social space. The pointisthatin each case the relation\\nbetween the social and the spatialisdifferent, and the impactofthe\\none upon the otheriscorrespondingly varied. In the case where\\ncontacts between companies occur only because ofpropinquity,\\nspatialform can be seen to be influencing the form ofsocial\\nrelations throughitscharacter ofbeing inpartunplanned. While it\\nwill bepossible toexplainthelocations ofcompany Aand\\ncompany B individually, their relative spatiallocation may not\\nhave a direct cause, the two locations having been arrivedat\\nindependently . But such \\'accidental\\' relativespatiallocations may\\nhave effects, perhaps enabling/provoking contacts between the\\ncompanies , for instance. Thus the accidental juxtapositions and\\ndistancings ofsocial space may throughtheir bringing together and\\nseparating ofsocialphenomena have an effect on how those\\nphenomena work. Such effects may be \\'positive\\' or\\'negative\\'\\n(negative externalities are a clear case ofthelatter). Thepointis\\nthatsocial space has aspects both of\\'order\\'andof\\'chaos\\' (Massey,\\n1992),oftheintended andunintended, the directly plannedand the\\nunplanned - andofattempts atnegotiated stabilisations in between\\n- which represent bothdifferent types ofrelations between \\'the\\nsocial\\' and \\'thespatial\\'anddifferent sources for the impactofthe\\nlatteron theformer.Thesecontrasting aspectsofspatiality\\nhighlight different aspects of the geography of power relations\\nand indicate different sources ofcontradictions potentially existing\\nin thespatiality ofthe social.\\nAs has been said, SpatialDivisionsofLabourconcentrates firmly\\non only one aspectofthesemultifarious possibilit ies:spatial\\nstructures within firms. It must be stressed, for there has occasion\\xad\\nally been some confusion, thatspatialstructures are not the same as\\nspatialdivisions oflabour. While the former are intra-company\\nconcepts, the term spatialdivisionoflabourrefers to a more overall\\nform of uneven development, which will vary over time, and which\\nis theproductofall thespatial structures ofproduction then in\\nexistence, but - it is hypothesised - most likely dominated by (in the\\nsenseofstructured by, not of numerical dominance) one or a small\\ngroup of spatialstructures . Animportant question at issue there\\xad\\nfore, and which is not centrally addressed in the preceding chapters,\\nis thenatureofthe relations (including non-relations) between\\nspatialstructures inconstructing spatialdivisions oflabour. 338SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nElaborating theinvestigation ofspatialdivisions oflabourin this\\nwayopensanalysis to thedifferent degrees andnaturesof\\nintegration, ornon-integration, of activities within local/regional\\neconomies, and the powerrelations through which this is con\\xad\\nstructed. Places/localities /regionswill most frequently beembedded\\nin amultitude ofspatialstructures, andpartof their specificity\\ncomes from the articulation ofthesestructures within them, and the\\nemergent effects which result, as well as from the role ofthe place\\nwithin its wider setting. Settingthe analysis ofspatialstructures in a\\nwider view of spatiality bothenables analysis ofthisinternal\\nstructure andopensthe way to thinking more clearly aboutthe\\nstructural potential of localeconomic strategies (seeLovering, 1986;\\nandFincher, 1986).It opens it also to the powerstructures ofinter\\xad\\nfirm, as well as intra-firm, relations throughwhichdifferent places\\narearticulated into aneconomy. Analysis in this vein would, for\\ninstance, pointto the precise ways in which the northern and\\nwestern regions of the UK have over recent decades been seriously\\ndis-integrated , in the sense ofincreasingly being the loci for\\ncollections ofspatialstructures which have little in the way of\\ndirectand active economic relationwith each other.Such a process\\nisprobably happening to themajority ofregional/local economies\\nas they become more directly linked into globalspatialstructures ;\\nindeed such a phenomenon isoftenremarked upon. But the wayin\\nwhich it is happening, anditsconsequences, will vary from case to\\ncase.\\nThe analysis ofindustrial districtscould be enriched alongsimilar\\nlines,throughamorerigorous conceptualisation oftheirspatiality.\\nThecontentofsocialpowerwhichimbuestheinter-firm linkages\\nwhich criss-cross the districts, the social relations which locate (and\\ntherebyhelpconstruct) people in particular labour-market positions\\nwithin them, the shiftingflowsofdominance andsubordination in\\nthe wider relations which link these districtsto the world economy,\\ntotheirexportmarkets, tomultinational capital- aconsideration\\nofall these would greatlyaidourunderstanding ofindustrial\\ndistricts andourassessment of their potential future(see, for\\ninstance, Amin and Robins, 1990, and Amin, 1994). Itwould be\\npossible to begin from locationally-concentrated spatial structures\\n(see pp. 96-71 butgo on to investigate furtherthe social natureof\\nthe\\'unequal marketrelations\\' (p. 97) which holdthemtogether and\\nlink them intoa widereconomy . On the one handthe real social\\ncontentoftherelations which bind together the firms \\'within\\'the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 339\\ndistricts could be elaborated to teaseoutthepowerrelations which\\nstructure them internally. On the otherhand the very different\\npowerrelations whichconstruct theirconnection to the world\\neconomy, linking these place-based constellations tointernationa\\xad\\nlisedspatialstructures characterised by bothspatialreach and great\\npotential geographical flexibility emphasise the inherent vulner\\xad\\nabilityofsomeofthese areas. In outlining thatexample, I had in\\nmind some oftheindustrial districts said to characterise \\'the third\\nItaly\\'. But the City ofLondon has also been characterised as an\\nindustrial district, based on finance. If it isto be so characterised\\nthen itsnature,in termsofthe social relations whichconstruct it, is\\nvery different. The structure ofpowerrelations contrasts dramati\\xad\\ncally with thatofthethirdItaly.Internally there has been a strong\\ncohesion, imposed by the dominating powerofthemajorplayers\\nincluding most particularly the Bank ofEngland (although more\\nrecently the shifting statusof the area in relation to the global\\neconomy has broughtsomeofthoseold-established linesofcontrol\\nmore into question) . Thiscoherence-in-dominance is verydifferent\\nfrom what seems to be the mixture of coherence andanarchywhich\\ncharacterises other,small-firm based, districts. Moreover, thepower\\nstructure oftherelations beyond the district is equally distinct.\\nInsteadofbeinganxious to gain access to the dominant spatial\\nstructures ofthe world economy, the City ofLondonis the home\\xad\\nbase for some ofthosestructures. Both its strengths and its\\npotential vulnerabilities are very different. Extending the kind of\\nanalysis suggested in the preceding chapters forintra-firmrelations\\nto all the varied kinds of economic relations, especially including\\nthose between firms, would give a much fuller, and more complex\\nandinternally disintegrated and possibly contradictory, pictureof\\nspatialdivisions oflabour.\\nA concludingnote on spatial structures\\nInSpatial Divisions ofLabour, famously, three different spatial\\nstructures ofproduction are used to illustrate theapproach to\\nanalysis. These are characterised assingle-region, cloning, and\\npart-process . Asbroadforms, they are also arguedto have been\\nimportant instructuring thespatialdivisions oflabourat different\\nperiods within the United Kingdom. Aftera decade of discussion\\nand useoftheseconcepts it isperhapsworth clarifying one or two\\npoints. Most basically, all these three are spatialstructures, which 340 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmay form partof spatial divisions of labour. Because I argued that\\nthepart-process spatialstructure may have been becoming particu\\xad\\nlarlyimportant in\\'structuring the geography of the UK,much of the\\nfocus of subsequent work by others has been on thatparticular\\nstructure, In the extreme, the part-process spatialstructure came to\\nbe seen as thespatialstructure, and even as thespatial division of\\nlabour.Moreover its form became frozen. This is not what was\\nintended. All three of these spatial structures may be the bases for\\nspatialdivisions oflabour,in the sense of being of particular\\nimportance in individual places or periods. But more than this,\\nfor reasons which probably vary, from my own terminological\\ninexactitude (particularly regarding the notionof\\'archetype\\') to\\nthe factthatit isan easier interpretation than the one I had in mind,\\nthese three spatial structures have sometimes been read as (i) the\\nonly three structures which could possibly exist, (ii) full specifica\\xad\\ntionsofactualstructures, and/or(iii) formulae which one can rush\\nout and search for in one\\'s next empirical study. This is again not\\nwhat was intended! Indeed the opening discussion cautions against\\nanyapproach which identifies a particular empirical form and holds\\nit up to be universal (p. 67). On the contrary, what the approach\\nthroughspatialstructures tries to do \\'is to recognise from the start\\nthe existenceand importance of variety. It attempts to formulate an\\napproach toconceptualising and examining the apparently endless\\nadaptability and flexibility ofcapital\\'(p. 67): to do otherwise is to\\ndisarm ourselves. The spatialstructures attempt to do this by\\ndemonstrating \\'dimensions ofpotential variation. They do not\\nexhaustthatpotential. They represent three out of many ways in\\nwhich the relations of production can be organised over space\\'\\n(p.67).\\nThis is so in a numberof ways. First, the types as specified are\\nextremely simple, and need in any particular case to be more clearly\\nset out (see pp. 73-4). Second, within each broad type or class of\\nspatialstructure widevariations in detail may be found which it\\nmight be important to specify (pp. 73-7). Third,there are endless\\npossibilities ofcompletely different forms of spatial structure. Some\\nof these are spelled outbriefly in the book (pp. 73-4 and 105, for\\ninstance). Some very interesting work by a group of geographers at\\nSouthampton, in the 1980s,analysed the specificityof the structures\\nin which important sectors of their region were set (Pinch, Mason\\nand Witt, 1989; Mason, Pinch and Witt, 1991)and other examples\\nare alluded to in Allen (1988), Massey, Quintas, Wield (1992), Reflections on Debates over a Decade 341\\nMassey (1988) and in the research at Bristol on the financial sector\\n(see, for instance, Leyshon, ThriftandTwommey , 1988).\\nInOctober 1991therewas astrikeat thecar-production\\ncompany Renault. Thestrikewasconcentrated at oneplant,at\\nCleonjustwestofParis. But its effects spreadrapidlythroughthe\\ncompany more widely. The reason for this, and for the strength\\nthus made evident on the partofthestrikers,wasanalysed (though\\nnot in these terms) in an articlein theThe Financial Times\\n(Dawkins, 1991).Itlaydirectly in thespatialstructure of\\nproduction which had been adopted by thecompany. Itwas a\\npart-process structure but with two crucial features. First,it did not\\nhavemulti-sourcing : inRenaulta very high percentage ofengines\\nand gearboxes were sourced from this one plantat Cleon (Dawkins ,\\n1991). Second, the company had recently adopted ajust-in-time\\nmethod,reducing capital requirements greatly, but also on the other\\nhandmakingmore tight and vulnerable the links between different\\nplantsin thespatialstructure .\\'Therisk, asRenaulthas found, is\\nthatone supply blockage can quickly bring the whole company to\\nits knees. Fordsuffered for the same reason in 1988when a strike in\\nBritaindisrupted production in Belgium and Germany\\' (Dawkins,\\n1991). In otherwords, slight modifications in the form ofspatial\\nstructure turnedwhat can often be the difficulties posed for unions\\nbypart-process structures into anadvantage .Itisimportant to be\\nalert to the endless flexibility (in the sense ofspecificity) ofcapital,\\nto be aware thatits strategies are not always guaranteed success,\\nthatthey are always contestable. Spatialorganisation is both a\\nstakeand a weapon in the variouspower struggles in society, not\\nleast in the geography ofindustry.\\n8.5Genderandfeminism\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,in its first edition, was not a book\\nwritten within what was at thattime defined as the field offeminist\\ngeography. Thatis to say, in the terms ofthecontemporary\\ndefinition ofthatfield (which is different from the way in which\\nit would be defined today), it is neitherparticularly concerned with\\nwomennorcentrally focused on gender relations. In terms ofits\\nsubjectmatterit was, on the contrary, trying to addressoneofwhat\\nJane Jenson ironically calls \\'thebigquestions tackled by the big\\nboys\\' (Jenson, 1990, pp. 59 and 60). This is a formulation utterly 342SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nlacking in any strictcriteriaofdefinition, and yet we know - or at\\nleast a good many ofus know - exactly what she means. In the early\\n1980s, and perhapsstilltoday,industrial geography and regional\\nunevendevelopment were precisely such questions .\\nThis clearly does not mean, however, thatthe topic is immune to\\nfeminist treatment (indeedtodaymyposition wouldprobably be\\nthatit is precisely some ofthe\\'big-boys issues\\'thatare most\\nurgently in needoffeminist critique). And there was constructive\\ndebateaboutthebook\\'srelationship to feminism in the years\\nfollowing its publication (see especially, for a constructive and\\ninsightful consideration ofthe issues, Bowlby, FoordandMcDo\\xad\\nwell, 1986; also Huxley, 1989, Johnson, 1989, and Walker, 1989,\\n[Massey, 1989provides a briefdebatewith these last three pieces];\\nand Rose, 1993, provides a contextual ising review ofthebookand\\nofthe response to it within feminist geographyj.\\'\\nRecapitulation ofthemes\\nNonethe less, in SpatialDivisionsofLabourI didattemptto tackle\\nthe issues as a feminist, thoughone who was in those days more\\npolitically engaged thantheoretically sophisticated. Issuesof\\n\\'gender\\', in one way or another, runthrough thebook. These\\nrange in tone and contentfrom ironic asides aboutthe domestic\\nincompetence, andtherefore dependency, of young men from the\\nsouthofItaly (Section 3.2, Some issues, p. 84) to more general\\npolitical reflections on how racism and sexism, and the construc\\xad\\ntionsofrace and gender, divide the working class (Section 2.3, A\\nframework, pp.33--4)and how the sexism of male workers (thatis,\\nthe cause of thatdivision within the working class) can bring about\\ntheirownandwiderdefeats(Section 6.3,Socialandspatial\\nrestructuring in theworking class, p. 284).\\nHowever, the ways in which issues of gender are most consis\\xad\\ntently woven into the argument are those which revolve aroundthe\\nbook\\'score themes. Since in the preceding chapters these issues are\\nembedded inparticular analyses,itisperhapsagain worth pulling\\noutsomeofthe main threads. Most clearly, there is a focus on\\ndivisions oflabour,mostparticularly the division oflabourin paid\\nwork, and their relationship to gender. Throughout, there is an\\ninsistence thatnoneofthese things is simply \\'natural\\'. On the\\ncontrary, they are socially constructed. Inparticular, the social\\nallocation ofdifferent socialgroups,in this case men and women, Reflections on Debates over a Decade 343\\ntoparticular places in the economic division oflabourcannotbe\\nexplained by the natureofthelabourprocess, the requirements of\\ntechnology, or any oftheotherproduction-deterministic variations\\nwhich are so frequently cal1edupon to play this role. Rathersuch\\nsocial al1ocation (and the subsequent societalvaluation ofthejobs\\ninquestion) ispartand parcel of(thatis to say, bothan effect of,\\nand actively implicated in the process of) the social construction of\\ngender. The historical study ofthefootwear industry stresses the\\ntotal lack ofa basis in production for the sexual division oflabour\\nwhich has been consolidated over thecenturies inthatindustry. The\\nstudyofelectronics refuses to take for granted what was then\\nusual1yasserted to be women\\'s naturalability at \\'detailed fiddly\\njobs\\' (Section 4.2·,Labouras a\\'location factor\\':a social process,\\np. 135), and comparisons ofcars and electronics (Section 3.3,\\nSpatialstructures and social structures, p.III)amonganumber\\nofotherexamples make the same point,and it is not one which is\\nnowparticularly controversial.\\nIndeed, both theoretical and empirical research now indicate that\\nthe setofinterlocking relations and processes is far more complex\\nthan isindicated in the preceding chapters. Inparticular , while\\nSpatialDivisionsofLabourtalksofthe divisions of race and gender\\nbeing\\'constructed as much outsideas within the workforce\\' (p. 34)\\nit in fact places most ofits reliance for the construction of gender\\non\\'widersociety\\' invarious guises,andpaysrelatively little\\nattention to the powerful forces for such construction which can\\nequally be found within the workplace . Where it does, however,\\ndwellon the ways in which paid work, and the social interpretations\\nput upon it, can actively participate in theformation ofparticular\\ngendercategories/characteristics, it isperhapsmore likely to talk\\nabouttheconstruction of masculinity than femininity. Thus, the\\ndiscussion ofthedefinition ofskills in the clothingindustry reflects\\non the struggles ofaparticular groupofmen to preserve their\\nthreatened masculinity (Section 4.3, Spatialstructures ofbig firms,\\np. 161);most obviously, the exploration ofemployment changes in\\nmining areas points out how a centralstake in what was at issue in\\nthose years was a specific (time -spacespecific) characterisation of\\nmasculinity formed very much in relationto aparticular kindof\\nwork in a particular sector - the sexismwhich was integral in it, the\\nbewilderment and even pain with which manymen met the\\nchal1enge to it, the self-defeating divisiveness which it represented\\nwithin the working class. At least it makes the pointthatmen and 344 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmasculinity are - or shouldbe - as much an issue for feminist, or\\ngender-aware (better:gender-challenging), geography as are women\\nand femininity.\\nFurther, and moving beyond the constellation of issues around\\ndivisions of labourspecifically, there is a concern to argue that, and\\ntoillustrate the variety of ways in which, the social relations of\\nproduction and of gender (in anotherterminology, capitalism and\\npatriarchy) articulate with and mutually inflect each other. The\\nmostobvious andsustained case here is the comparison in\\nChapter 5 between the coalfield areas and Cornwall. Thecompar\\xad\\nison of \\'the pre-existing structures\\' as well as ofthesubsequent\\n\\'combination of layers\\' in these very different areas is in part\\nconcerned tounderscore how in each there is an articulation of\\nspatialform, with the social relations ofandaroundproduction ,\\nand with the constructed form of gender relations (seeperhapsin\\nparticular Section 5.3, A different kind of \\'periphery\\': the case of\\nCornwall). A ratherdifferent instance is thatof the variety of ways\\nin which gender is a significant axis in the formation ofspatial\\nstructures ofproduction (Section 3.3, Spatial structures and social\\nstructures, p. 112, and Section 4.3, Spatialstructures of big firms,\\npp.161-2).Whatsuchcases do is to carry into this particular field\\nthe more general themes of (i) thinking in terms of articulation , and\\nspecifically (ii) articulation between class-related and othersocial\\nrelations in (iii) the production of (spatially) varied outcomes.\\nItis,moreover , precisely the fact thatthis really is articulation\\n(and not the adding-in of some consideration from one arenato a\\nstorywhich is really aboutanother) whichenables amutual\\ninfluencing of the relations in play. Thus the study of the shoe\\nindustryanalyses the impact which the embedded sexual division of\\nlabourhashadon the degree oforganisation of thelabour\\nmovement, on technological change and on the locational strate\\xad\\ngiesof capital within the sector (Section 3.2, An example, pp. 90-6).\\nIn themid-nineteenth centuryit was precisely a combination of\\nchanges in the organisation ofproduction with \\'the stubbornly\\nunchanging relations between the sexes\\' which accelerated the\\nprocess of urbanisation in the East Midlands region. In later years\\nthecombination of sexual divisions of labourbothwithin paid\\nwork and more widely, the potential for technical change and the\\nconstantly shifting surfaces of locational possibilities (themselves, in\\nrelation to labour,exhibiting significant gender differences) were\\ntogether involved in producing the beginnings of a new spatial Reflections on Debates over a Decade 345\\nstructure (see Section 4.3, Spatialstructures ofbig firms, pp. 162\\xad\\n4). In the overall story ofthegeography ofthefootwear industry,\\nthen, a whole set ofsocialrelations and social practices is involved:\\nthenatureofcapitalin the sector, technical change, the sexual\\ndivisionoflabouroutsideofpaid work, the natureoftherelations\\nofproduction , the sexual division oflabourwithin work, the\\nlocational strategies offirms, and the impactofplace and ofthe\\nexternally changing geography ofsocialrelations, especially the\\nlocational strategies ofothersectors.Genderisimplicated in this\\nstorythroughout: its verydefinition and theorganisation of gender\\nrelations within and beyond paid work are bothmoulded inrelation\\nto and have their own impactupon all the otherelements in the\\nunfolding story. Or again, a combination ofprevailing ideologies of\\ngender with the place in the economy ofdifferent sectorsof\\nproduction isarguedto have been influential in thepolitical\\ndetermination of thegeographical areas which would beassigned\\nregional policy assistance (Section 4.1, The inheritance : social and\\nspatial,pp.126-7).\\nIn this sense then gender isessential to the empirical story told in\\nthebook. At a micro level it is a crucial axis in the formation of\\nspatialstructures in anumberofpartsofindustry. Morebroadly, it\\nis an essential component in any serious understanding ofthe\\norganisation andreorganisation of British economic space over the\\nperiod in question. Aseconomic policy and political strategyunder\\nWilsonenabled theemergence on to the labourmarket in\\nDevelopment Areas of a particular kind of female labour, itself\\nconstructed in aparticular and locally-specific field ofgender\\nrelations, so in some ofthe big cities, and most especially in\\nLondon, acombination of increasing international competition\\n(from the exploitation ofwomen in the ThirdWorld)and the\\nincreasing demandfor female workers in the growing service sectors\\nmeantthatanothergroupof women - young, usually childless \\xad\\nwas coming to be in very shortsupply. Some ofthecompanies\\nsqueezed in this pincer went \\'north\\'to the coalfields, or to the West\\nCountry - moving from one changing labourmarketfor women to\\nanother.Othercompanies went lessfar, sometimes shiftingto areas\\nlike the East Midlands and thus disrupting yetanother labour\\nmarkethighlystructured on gender lines, and expelling existing\\nemployers to yet more \\'peripheral\\' areas.\\nBoth gender and geography, therefore, wereintegral to the\\nrecomposition ofemployment over this period,and gender was 346 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nintegral to the geographical reorganisation which took place. This\\nwas so in two ways. Both geographical differences in systems of\\ngender relations and differences between distinct groups ofwomen\\nwereimportant. The clearest example of the first, in this particular\\nstory, is the creation ofpotential labour-forces withparticular\\ncharacteristics, out of the gender relations of Cornwall and the\\ncoalfields. But the second aspect - differences among women, and\\ntheirhighly specific and distinct characteristics - isequally\\nimportant in itsarticulation with the shifting economic geography\\nof this period. The \\'younggirls\\' of the capital, not \\'yet\\'married\\n(labourmarketliterature seemsalways to assume thatmarriage will\\nbe their fate) and certainly without children, left the dismal\\nconditions of the footwear industry in droves - or, more likely,\\njustdidn\\'tgo into it on leaving school. Instead they took up their\\nplaces- as secretaries, receptionists, clerks and typists - at the heart\\nof the new emergence ofLondonas a world city. Deprived of this\\nlabourforce the footwear industryboth shifted locationandsought\\nout a different group of women. This time the industry sought out\\nwomen who were not cheap because they were assumed only to be\\nin this job for a while, until they \\'settled down\\',but cheap because\\nnow they were (assumed to be) married, with otherfunctions and\\ninterests as their prime concern and pressing constraints on their\\nability to search a wider field for more remunerative employment.\\nThe women of the coalfields weredifferent again, valued in the first\\nplace primarily for their supposed \\'greenness\\'. Women as labour\\npower, in this case as a result of the distinct modes oftheir insertion\\ninto(patriarchal) social relations, are a highly varied group.\\nGillian Rose (1993)has recently suggested that\\'marxists examine\\nthe uneven development of capitalist production, feminists focus on\\ntherelationship between production andreproduction aspartof\\ncapitalist patriarchy\\' (p. 113).Whatever is actually the case, such a\\ndivision of labourmust weaken the arguments of both streams of\\nthought. Not only are the categories (production/reproduction)\\nthemselves open to re-examination, but feminist (and marxist)\\nanalyses each have a contribution to make in a wider spectrum of\\nfieldsthan this\\'.In particular, as the next section reflectsand as Rose\\ndemonstrates , feminism has much to say in the sphere of modes of\\ntheorising and of conceptualisation . However, the reason Rose pulls\\nout thiscontrastisto highlight a tendency within feminist geography\\ntoemphasise \\'women\\'s diverseexperiences ofproduction and\\nwomen\\'s shared experience of reproduction in thecontextof the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 347\\nWestern City\\'(p. 116), to assume\\'thesimilarity ofwomendue to\\ntheirsharedexperience ofreproductive workandtheirdiversity due\\ntodifferent experiences ofunevenproduction relations\\' (pp. 121-2).\\nThisis anassumption which is unwarranted, as Rosepointsout.It\\nunderestimates thedifferences amongwomenin thesphereof\\nreproduction, mostparticularly alonglinesofsexuality andethni\\xad\\ncity, as well as ofclass.Moreover, there is a furtherpoint.Forthe\\ndifferences amongwomen in the sphereofproduction which are\\nmostoftenstressedare those of(sociological) class:middleclass as\\nopposed toworking class,andsoforth.Whattheanalyses in the\\npreceding chapters show,however, isthatthis is by no meansthe\\nonly form ofdifferentiation amongwomenin thissphere. Also\\nimportant, not only in differentiating amongwomenbutalso in\\nsettingthemagainsteachotherin termsofimmediate interests in the\\nlabourmarketandinrelationtocapital,arethemorecomplex and\\nmultifarious aspectsofwhatare called abovetheirdistinctmodesof\\ninsertion intothe social relations ofpatriarchy .\\nFinally, sincemuchofwhatwas going on between the sixties and\\ntheeightieswas ashiftingsetofstrategies on thepartofBritish\\nindustry (andofthe British government inrelation to theBritish\\neconomy) to try to becomemoreinternationally competitive, so it\\ncan beunderstood thatsuchstrategies were actively usingspatial\\ndifferences ingenderrelations andbetween groupsofwomenin\\ntheirattempts to getoutofwhathasbecome theseemingly\\nperpetual weakness ofthe British economy.\\nAconsciousness ofthisgenderelement inthestoryalso\\ninfluences anyevaluation oftheregional policyoftheperiod.In\\nthe early days (andto anunfortunate extentstilltoday)such\\nevaluation wascarriedoutthrough thecorrelation ofthetiming\\nand sizeofthedecentralisation ofemployment with the timingand\\ngeographical distribution ofregional-policy incentives . It was a\\nclassic case ofthe\\'correlation-between-maps\\' approach referred to\\ninChapter 2. When a high correlation wasfoundbetween these two\\nphenomena, it wasdeduced thatthey were causally relatedand\\nmoreover (though this was by no meansshownby thestatistics\\nthemselves) thatregional policy was the causeofthedecentralisa\\xad\\ntion. On this reading, regional policyemerged ashavingbeenquite\\nsuccessful. Thedetailed,period-by-period analyses inChapter 6\\n(Section 6.2, Uneven development andnational politics) presenta\\nrangeofbothmethodological andsubstantive arguments to\\ndemonstrate theinadequacy ofthisapproach. Running through 348SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthesearguments, andthroughthedebatewhichtookplace over the\\nperiodaboutthe effectiveness of regional policy, was a threadof\\nargument concerning gender.\\nThe original, regression-based ,evaluations had paid no attention\\nto gender. But it was not long before complaints from the regions\\xad\\nfrom trade unionists and otherspokesmen - made clear thatthe\\njobswhich were arriving were not of the kind which hadbeen\\nexpected: they were \\'forwomen\\'. A revised evaluation of regional\\npolicy emerged, more mutedin its claims for success. In its overtly\\nsexist version this evaluation objected thatthe incoming jobswere\\nnotfor thenewly-unemployed, thatthey were \\'only\\' for women.\\nThe more respectable version implicitly carried the same message,\\narguing thatthe fact thatthe new jobswere for women was\\nunfortunate in the sense that,because women\\'s jobstend to be\\nless well paid, part-time, less skilled . . . aggregate regional income\\nwould decline and everybody would suffer.\\nBut, of course, not everyone would suffer. To begin with, the\\nattractiveness tocapitalof thisparticular femaleworkforce resulted\\nprecisely from the construction over the years of the specificity of\\nthe local gender culture. To the extent, therefore, thatthe men of\\nthe region were implicated in the construction of thisculture,they\\nonly had themselves to blame. But fu rther,a largepartof the\\nemployment entering these regions over the period cannotbeput\\ndown entirely to the operation of regional policy. Chapter 6 spells\\nout some of the varied articulations of causes in which regional\\npolicy was to various degrees and in a variety of ways involved; but\\nalso involved was a shifting search by industry for new sources of\\nfemalelabour.So any claims for the successof regional policy have\\nto take such complexities into account. Working in theopposite\\ndirection, however, is the fact that,while certainly much ofthe new\\nemployment was low paid, part-time, designated as lowskilled, etc.,\\nit did none the less for the first time, and at the price of the double\\nshift, bring some independent income for a significant numberof\\nwomen in these partsof thecountry.Moreover, as the very fact of\\nthe initial complaints itself indicates, it began to disruptsome of\\nthose old gender relations. On this score, then, although not on\\nothers,regional policy can be seen to have had some quite positive\\neffects, but in a wholly different way from thatclaimed by those\\nwhoperformed the initial correlation-based evaluations .\\nSuchreinterpretations arearrivedat notjustbylooking at\\nwomen, but by investigating geographical variations in the con- Reflections on Debates over a Decade 349\\nstruction ofmasculinity and femininity, and the relations between\\nthe two. Moreover, the very focus on geographical variation insists\\non the fact thatwhat is at issue here is not some essentialism of\\n\\'men\\'and\\'women\\', but how people are (variously) constructed in\\nrelationto adistinction between masculinity and femininity.\\nA question ofconceptual approach\\nThesestrandsofthought concerning genderwerewritteninto\\nSpatialDivisions ofLabourfrom aposition which was self-con\\xad\\nsciously feminist. Were I writing it todaythey would be treated\\ndifferently and in more depth.Studying thebookagain now,\\nhowever, anotherthreademerges. Jane Jenson(1990) has written\\nabouthow, in her case, the form taken by her theoretical research,\\nandparticularly herinvention oftheconceptofpermeable Fordism,\\nwas made possible by her readingoffeministtheoretical work.That\\nis,although theconceptwas not designed as one within the field of\\ngender studies or even feminist theory, its form was influenced by its\\noriginator \\'sacquaintance with the latterbodyofwork.Something\\nsimilar may be the case with certainaspectsofSpatialDivisions of\\nLabour.Itisperhaps worthwhile reflecting on some intellectual\\nhistoryinorderto explore this point. But it must be stressed from\\nthestartthatthis isnotanattemptretrospectively to claim Spatial\\nDivisionsofLabourforfeminist geography. Thatisnotthepoint,\\neitherway.Ratherit seems valuable to reflect back on the book\\nnow, and most specifically on the natureof itstheorising , from a\\nfeminist perspective.\\nCentralto manyofthearguments inSpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nis thenotionofarticulation .Itiscrucial to the idea ofcausality and\\ncausalstructures, it is the basis ofthepostulated relationbetween\\nthe general and the particular, it is the means oflinking the global\\nand the local (the wider relations ofaspatialdivisionoflabour\\nimbricated in theparticularities ofplace), it is the means ofthinking\\nofaparticular formofemployment (ajob)at aparticular pointin\\nspace-time as theproductofsetsofrelations with otherpartsofthe\\nemployment structure ,relations themselves also stretched out to\\nformthattime-space.\\nItis difficult ever to be sure ofwhere and why particular ideas\\ncome to be important inone\\'smode of thinking. In the case of\\narticulation , however, it probably derived from, or was certainly\\nunderlined in significance by, my early readings ofworks in and 350SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\naroundMarxism. Itwas acombination ofThe German Ideology\\nand Louis Althusser which was the real spark.The German Ideology\\nwas oneofthe firstbooksI read within Marxism - this would be in\\nthe late sixties - and it posed problems for me. The reason it did so\\nwas the natureof itsruminations on the\\'essential\\' difference\\nbetween humanbeings and otheranimals.Itseemed to me to be\\naconcernwhich was not only unnecessary to aliberatory political\\nprojectbut one which was also likely to hamperany such projectby\\nthepotential essentialism ofthe way it was in practicetreated.For\\nalthough Marxand Engels in this work are quitescrupulous in their\\ntheoretical injunctions againstbothspiritual and biological essenti\\xad\\nalism(attacking these things is afterallpartofthepointofthe\\nwork)their own implementation ofthis leaves some questions.\\nHumanbeings are said to produce themselves by \\'labour\\', or at\\nleast this is the main emphasis, ratherthanby activity, experience\\nor, more generally, practice. Thereis a reference to the \\'large\\'\\nhistorical component inhumannature(mymarginal noteofmore\\nthantwenty five years ago says \\'total\\').Moreover , thenatureofthe\\nresidue implied in the text by the word \\'large\\'(i.e.nottotal)\\nbecomes clear as the analysis proceeds, and my marginal notes\\nbecome more anguished. Thereis reference to the \\'firsthistorical\\nact\\'as being the production ofthe means to satisfy the needs of\\neating,drinking, habitation andclothing.Thereis theapproach to\\nthehistorical development ofthe division oflabour,\\'whichwas\\noriginally nothing but the division oflabourin the sexual act\\'.\\nThereare thespecifications of the division ofsociety into \\'families\\',\\nandofthe division oflabourwithin the family, as \\'natural\\'. The\\npointhere is not to criticise the work,which was written at a\\nparticular time and with a particular aim in view (and indeed there\\nareambiguities even on the pointsmentioned above) so much as to\\nindicatethe effect on me ofareadingof it.Thereseemed to be a\\ndivision here between the large element ofhumannaturewhich was\\nhistorical and aremainder which was read as being priorto, and\\nthus even more worryingly perhapsexternalto,history.\" Moreover,\\nand this was the pointwhich exercised me most, if there was\\naccepted to be in these spheressomething called the essential\\nhumanbeing (i.e. in this formulation an aspect priortohistory)\\nthen any minutenow there would be the essential woman. To a\\nyoungfemale at the time determined toescapemanyofthe\\ncharacteristics usually held up as female, together with much of\\nwhatlifereputedly held instore-marriage, children, etc. - this was Reflections on Debates over a Decade 351\\nnot easy reading.Farfromliberation, it seemed like a trap.Itwas\\nAlthusser , with his ideas ofstructured causality (most especially\\n\\'Contradiction andOverdetermination\\') and his famous dictum\\nthat\\'thereis nopointofdeparture\\' (inotherwords,on myreading,\\nthere isnothingwhich you have to acceptaseternally pre-given,\\nwhich is not in itself a productofprevious causalstructures) who\\nprovided a welcome way out. Itisinteresting, in thiscontext, to\\nnotethatJaneJenson,intracingout her own trajectory, not only\\nrefers inparticular to the work of Nicos Poulantzas (p.65),but also\\nand most pointedly in thiscontextshe argues thatit was a political\\nanti-essentialism and aderived need to tacklethetheoretical\\nconstruction ofgenderrelations, which lay at the heartof her\\nstory. The springboard forlaunching into anexploration ofthese\\nwaysofthinking, sheargues, was the need to tackle\\'the\\nimplications of oneoftheoldestinstitutions ofthewomen\\'s\\nmovement ,that\"women are made, not born\"\\'. As she says \\'A\\nwidereadingofthis insight compels us to thinknotonlyaboutthe\\nsocialconstruction ofgenderrelations but also aboutthe ways in\\nwhichallsocialrelations areconstructed \\' (p. 60, emphasis in\\noriginal) and furtherthat\\'If my feminism made impossible any\\nassumptions thatclass was the primarycontradiction, mypersonal\\nexperience with the varieties ofwaysofbeing a womanand a\\nfeminist... made any resortto essentialism impossible . The only\\npossible conclusion wasthatrelations ofdifference mustbe asocial\\nconstruction, andI began to wonder how social relations of\\ndifference, reflecting inequities ofpower,cameintoexistence\\'\\n(p.65).10\\nThis, evidently, is to refer to only one type offeminism: that\\ndeveloped at a particular moment in specific social and theoretical\\ncontexts. By no means all varieties offeminism are in this sense\\nanti-essentialist andsome recent work has anywayproblematised\\nthedistinction between essentialism and (social) constructionism .\\nDianaFuss (1989), for instance, hasdemonstrated thefrequent\\nmutualdependence ofthe twoapproaches , andarguedin effectthat\\nneitherpositioncan be entirely pure.

Reflections on Debates over a Decade 353\\nBut if, for me, whatananti-essentialist position (even if it cannot\\nbe a\\'pure\\'one) has in the pastrepresented is anoptimism of\\nontological assumptions withparticular reference to feminism, it\\nhassubsequently beeninvested withotheradvantages, most\\nparticularly the way in which, through theconstant recognition of\\narticulation, itenables anapproach to thecontingencies and\\nuniquenesses, as well as the broadstructures, ofspace-time .\\nWithingeography therelational approach has been explicitly\\ntakenup bySusanHanson (1992),andoneofitsclearest\\nformulations is by the feminist writer DonnaHaraway. Haraway\\n(1991)arguesfor a politics of affinityratherthanofidentity(see,\\nforinstance, \\'Reading BuchiEmecheta\\' and\\'Manifesto for\\nCybergs\\') andat theheartofherdiscussions is arejection ofa\\nnature/culture dichotomy ofa type which sees natureas merely a\\nresource to be takenup byculture.Natureis in such formulations\\npre-given, apointofdeparture (topickup onAlthusser\\'s\\nformulation) andoneofthe forms in which it exists is as the\\nbody,andas sex in counterposition to(cultural) gender(see also\\nGrimshaw, 1986).Haraway, as anaturalscientist, abiologist,\\narguesagainstsuchformulations - and,interestingly enough, sees\\nThe German Ideology as \\'themajorlocus for Marx\\'andEngels\\'\\nnaturalisation ofthe sexual division of labour,intheirassumption\\nof apre-social division of labourin the sex act (heterosexual\\nintercourse), itssupposed natural corollaries inthereproduct ive\\nactivities of men andwomen in the family, and the consequent\\ninability to place women in their relations to menunambiguously\\non the side ofhistoryandofthe fully social ...Therootdifficulty\\nwas aninability tohistoricize sexitself; likenature,sexfunctioned\\nanalytically, as aprimematteror rawmaterial for the work of\\nhistory\\' (\\'\"Gender\" for aMarxist Dictionary\\', pp. 131-2). In\\nformulating a way of knowing which can escape such debilitating\\nlimitations, she argues that\\'Difference istheorized biologically as\\nsituational , notintrinsic,at every level fromgene to foraging\\npattern\\' andthat\\'bodiesas objects ofknowledge arematerial\\xad\\nsemiotic generative nodes.Theirboundaries materialize in social\\ninteraction. Boundaries aredrawnbymapping practices ;\"objects\"\\ndo not pre-exist as such. Objectsareboundary projects\\' (\\'Situated\\nknowledges\\', pp.200-1).\\nThis, then, is not a view which does away with all distinction\\nbetween naturalprocesses andsocialprocesses, although theyboth\\nhave to be apprehended socially. WhatHaraway may bepointing 354SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nto is the possibility ofananti-essentialist theorising ofdifference\\nwithin the naturalfield as well as the social. Itis theassumption\\nthatdifference in natureisessentialist thatshe isattacking. The new\\ndebatesin biology are exploding thatoldnature/nurture dichotomy\\nnot(ornotonly) in the sense ofarguingthatthenaturalis also\\nsociallyapprehended but also - and to my mind at least equally\\nsignificantly - bydemonstrating thatenvironment (nurture) can\\nhave effects on organism (nature). In a passage which takes us back\\nto thecentraltheme, Ho (1988) has written \\'Organism and\\nenvironment engage in continual mutualtransformation byvirtue\\nof aninterconnectedness thatreticulates in space andtime\\' (p. 21).\\nThereisthen,here, in the similarities to ways ofthinking\\ndeveloped inpartin thecontextofthe women\\'s movement, a\\nconnection to the feminist theorising ofthe past decade.

Whether ornotcomponent production andassembly are\\nseparate branches ofproduction in this sense will depend,therefore ,\\nnot on some external characteristics ofthe twoprocesses , but on their\\nrelation to thestructure ofcapitalownership andthestructure of\\naccumulation.\\nItshouldbe saidthatthere has been considerable debateaboutthe\\nmeaning of\\'socialdivisionoflabour\\'.Thediscussion here is based on\\nCapital,vol. 1ch. xiv, section4.Marxis heremakinganassumption:\\n\\'onecommodity percapitalist\\' , which is empirically untenable today.\\nButneitherthis,northedisputeover the term \\'socialdivision of\\nlabour\\'matters here.Whatconcerns thepresentargument is the\\ndifference between marketrelations andcorporately-planned relations.\\nThis, again, marksthemoutasdefinitions specific to a capitalist\\neconomy .ItisworthquotingMarxagain, if only for his wry political\\ncomment s:\\nDivision oflabourwithintheworkshop implies the undisputed\\nauthority ofthecapitalist over men [sic],thatarebutpartsofa\\nmechanism thatbelongsto him.

Here thereisobviously adistinction to bemadebetween some ofthe\\nwork on corporate organisation andwhatmightbecalledmore Notes and References 359\\nstraightforward statistical analyses. It is the latterto which this point\\nmost clearly applies.Forthe former, whatis being suggested is more a\\nwayofconceptualising someofthedetailed results into a wider\\nframework .Manyofthe-ideas are similarto those in Dicken (1976),\\nforinstance, thoughit would not be suggested here thattheapproach\\nshouldbeconfined to the level oftheindividual firm, orthatthe prime\\ncauseshouldbe seen as managerial strategy.\\nChapter4: Some Changing SpatialStructures lnthe United Kingdom\\n1.Theinteraction ofall these factorsis discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.\\nForthemoment they are taken for granted- as the\\'location surface\\'\\nfacingindustry. In fact, as will be seen, this surfacewas being formed\\nat precisely the same time. Both sides ofthese new location factors\\nwere being constituted together.\\n2. This, ofcourse, ispre-eminently the case in the Free Production Zones\\noftheThirdWorld,the zones precisely functioning asareasin which,\\nunlike the rest ofthecountry, otherconditions areavailable to make it\\npossible to use the cheaplabourofsurrounding areas(seeFroebel,\\nHeinrichs andKreye, 1980).\\n3. This process ofchangeover is really an intersectoral phenomenon .\\'Old\\nmeansofproduction industries \\' - which would includethese middle\\nstages - were declining fast at this time (see also Chapter 6).\\n4. Even if they were, their effects, precisely because ofintranationality,\\nwould be different.\\n5. This argument appliesbothtoelectronics andtoinstruments . Like the\\nrest ofelectronics, mlh 354 has as a whole traditionally been heavily\\nconcentrated in theSouthEast, with an outlying centrein theNorth\\nWest. While much decentralisation toDevelopment Areashas\\noccurred in thesectoras a whole, the difficulties for small firms in\\nthis process are, as we shall argue, enormous .Oakeyin fact argues this\\nfor mlh 354 as a whole, but, as ever, there are differences within the\\nmlh. His arguments seem toapplyafortiorito the small firms in the\\nhigh-technology-based partofthesector- i.e. those being discussed\\nhere. In a numberofways,largerfirms may behavedifferently . In\\nparticular, they are more likely to introduce changes intechnology ,\\nand theadoption ofNC, and neo-Fordist labourprocesses may well\\nreduceskillrequirements sufficiently to enabledecentralisation\\n(Massey andMeegan, 1979;Perrons, 1979).Although suchtechniques\\nareapplicable tosmall-batch production, theirinstallation mayrequire\\nsignificant investment andtherefore at present be ruled out for many\\nsmall firms. Interestingly, oneofOakey\\'s case studieswhich involved\\nmovement to aDevelopment Area (the south-west) was of a larger\\nfirm (over 1,000workers) andone which did have a significant demand\\nfor semi-skilled labourpower. This demandwas easily satisfied, andit\\nwas mainly women who were employed (p. 279). The difficulties arose\\nas a result ofanattemptto relocatetheheadquarters.Thus,while\\'the\\naimofemploying a large number ofsemi-skilled predominantly 360 Notes and References\\nfemale, staff from the local area has been achieved\\', \\'criticism was\\nmade of the \"lack of intellectual, artistic and cultural entertainments\\nand lack of high-class shopping and civic amenities\" (questionnaire\\nresponse)\\' (p. 279). Even more forcefully, the major advantage and\\ndisadvantage of the (St Austell) location reflected this dichotomised\\nlabourdemand: \\'The major advantage gained from the new location\\nwas attested to be a \"cheaper and more stable labourforce\"\\n(questionnaire response). However, the main disadvantage was\\ndescribed as \"a period of sustained production and supply difficulties\\nwhich resulted from inadequate training and knowledge of new staff,\\nwhichso badly affectedsales,it wasexceptionallydifficult to recover\"\\n(questionnaire response)\\' (pp. 279-80). (Itis perhaps necessary to\\nstress that itischangesin location that are beingdiscussed. There are\\nlocally-owned firms in advanced electronics in both the north-east of\\nEngland and parts of Scotland, both established bases for such\\nactivity. The trends, however, are not in their favour.)\\n6. Someof thecausesof thisstempreciselyfrom measures adoptedbythe\\nGovernment \\'to make British industry more competitive\\'. Thus, the,\\nuse of incomes policies to hold down wages also means that people\\nhave less to spend, and some consumer-goods industries, such as\\nclothing, may suffer. This can happen both because people spend less\\noverall on clothing and because, with what they do spend, they may\\nput a higher premium on cheapness, and thus further encourage low\\xad\\ncost imports (NEDO, 1976).\\n7. The next section discussesthe serviceindustry. The decentralisation of\\nthis industry to the regions aroundthe south-east has also been an\\nimportant phenomenon and may have affectedcompetition for labour\\ninregionssuchas theeastmidlands. Certainly theshoeindustry inthat\\nregion suffered from increased competition for women workers over\\nthe sixties and seventies, in a few cases prompting a shift to\\nDevelopment Areas such as the Northern Region (see Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982; and Mounfield, Unwin and Guy, 1982, p. 192).\\n8. This difference relates to the sexual division of labour in the industry\\nand theparticular relevance of PBR systems in machining, which is\\nmainly done by women. While of all employeesin the industry about\\n50per cent are on someform of payment-by-results (PBR)system,this\\nproportion rises to between 55 and 60 per cent for women (Clothing\\nEDC,1972).The importance of PBR relates to the nature of the\\nlabourprocess in the industry. Technologically, the speed of\\nproduction can still be controlled by the individual worker, especially\\ninmachining, and speedhas therefore to bemaintained byamixture of\\nexhortation , incentiveand threat (seeMassey and Meegan, 1982).\\n9.\\'Unfortunately managements\\' efforts to deskilloperations bring other\\nproblems, related to job-satisfaction and the need for adequate\\ncompensation ... which are likely to cause increasing concern in the\\nnext fewyears\\' (NEDO, 1974a,p. 48).\\n10. The NEDO Reviewto 1977refersto this practice, and to some of the\\n\\'difficulties\\' itcan cause Notes and References 361\\nMigratory labour,particularly from those countries which have\\nspecial links with the EEC, may provide a new source of employees\\nfor the UK clothing industryas they already have in Germany. Such\\nlabour,particularly if employed by smaller establishments , would\\npose problems with regard to adequate supervision of their social\\nand working conditions (NEOO, 1974a, p. 48).\\nII. There wasalso, of course, an even larger reserveof cheap labourin the\\nThirdWorld and a number of the largest companies switched\\ninvestment abroad,thus further accelerating the problem ofimports\\n(NEOO, 1977,p. 54).\\n12. The aggregate figures show a high percentage of male employees in\\nLondon, but such figures conceal too many otherdifferences to allow\\nof confident inference.\\n13. Care must betaken beforegeneralisingor extrapolating thispoint. Not\\nall small firms in these sectors are in competition with larger. They\\noften servedifferent markets. What is being described here is the clear\\npartition into two groups ratherthan the startof a process of\\nextinction of small capital. Indeed, there is evidence in the 1970sof\\nhigher closure rates among multiples (medium sized) firms.\\n14. Or from 68.6 per cent to 72.9 per cent if Transport andCommun ica\\xad\\ntion are excluded as being more properly classified as production\\nindustries.\\nIS. Some of whom also - those in legalservices,for example - have their\\npre-capitalist bases, of course (see Lipietz, 1978),but who are not at\\npresentthreatened by \\'more capitalist\\' forms of organisation.\\n16. See also \\'Small firms . . . in the South East ofEngland\\' by Brimson,\\nMassey, Meegan, Minns and Whitfield (1980).\\n17. The same applies to wholesale distribution .\\n18. We are dealing here with employment, i.e. the production of the\\nservicesratherthan the levelof their provision. Dataon thelatterare\\nproduced e.g. inSocial Trends (CSO),although in examining levelsof\\nprovision the regional level is probably not the most - or the only \\xad\\nappropriate one.\\n19. The employment effects of these parts of the public sector are very\\ndifferent from those of the central State. The latter is not only\\nprimarilyconcentrated on London but in its recent moves, now\\ncurtailed, towards geographical decentralisation it hasreproduced and\\nthus reinforced the patternofregional social differentiation. Ithas\\nbeen most importantly the lower levelfunctions, and especiallyroutine\\nclerical jobs, which have been decentralised, These central State\\nfunctions, of course, include also some consumer services.\\n20. This is the point made by Mills and Lav (1964) in their critique of\\nLosch, for assuming bothprivate capitalist ownership and total\\ncoverage ofthe area/population .Marquand writes\\nAlthough consumer services are widely dispersed, there is consider\\xad\\nablevariation between MELAs in their endowment with them. The 362NotesandReferences\\nvariations are sufficientlywide to make it clear thatit isunjustifiable\\nto assume thatthemarketwilloperatetodistribute consumer\\nservices (relatively) evenly in relation to population, orpopulation\\nand size of urban centre (para. 4.64).\\n21. Cuts in public expenditure have in fact been reducing the rateof\\ngrowthin these sectors since 1975 (Marquand, 1979,para. 1.18).\\n22. The same authorspoint out elsewherethat these factors are reinforced\\nby State intervention in industry.\\n23. This, ofcourse, isthe corollary of the lack of servicelinksfrom branch\\nplants, noted by Marquand (1979).\\n24. One very important aspect of this process is the relative decline of\\nLondonand the relative gains in the rest of the south-east.\\nChapter 5: The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations\\nI. This coherence and simplicity ofeconomic structure was not confined\\nto mining towns. Humphrys (1972) writes of the tinplate towns of\\nsouth Wales: \\'in all these towns there was a direct and simple\\nrelationship between industry and community\\' (p. 23).\\n2. All this is comparative, with other industries and other kinds of\\ncommunity. There certainly are bases for sectionalism within mining.\\nThere are winding-enginemen, colliers, craftsmen and so on, and the\\nhistory of union organisation within the industry has often revolved\\nabouttheirinterrelation (Francis and Smith, 1980;Unofficial Reform\\nCommittee, 1912).But the relative homogeneity of the coal industry is\\nnone the lessclear, evenin comparison with theotherbasicindustries \\xad\\nsuchassteel- in the wider regions (Cooke, 198Ib).\\n3. Carney, Lewis and Hudson (1977) refer to this history in the north\\xad\\neast, and Francis and Smith (1980)document the history ofthe miners\\'\\nunion in south Wales in the twentieth century. There have been\\nconsiderable differences between regions, however; south Wales and\\nScotland have historically been far more militant than the north-east.\\n4. Even this process has not been smooth. By the end of the 1970s,\\ndeepening recession was causing losses of jobs in the new industries\\ntoo.Chapter6 looks at this variation over the period.\\n5. Which is not to deny that the geographical location of control has\\neffects- see Chapter3, and later in this chapter.\\n6. These kinds ofchanges apply not just to the range of incoming sectors\\nwhich are being mainly considered here, but also to others, such as the\\ncar industry.\\n7. External orientation isnot newto these areas, of course.The export of\\ncoal involved precisely that. But the direction of orientation, the\\nfunctions it performed and the markets it served, and the degree of\\nintraregional linkage it allowed, have all changed.\\n8. This sorting-process has, of course,also beencommented on byothers\\nin relation to the new towns of the South East. Notes and References 363\\n9. Neither is it without its parallels in the coalfield regions. There the\\nsources of alternative income are State transferpayments of various\\nsorts - including redundancy pay, miners\\' pensions and forms of EC\\nand ECSC income maintenance (mostly in steel areas). These are all\\ntemporary. Longer-lasting but at lower levelsis unemployment benefit,\\na form of State transfer which, in a \\'standard married couple\\'\\nsituation, is far more likely to cheapen female wages than male (since\\nmore men are eligible for unemployment benefit). These factors are\\nsmall, but not insignificant. Similar situations occur on a ratherlarger\\nscale in Ireland (Stanton, 1979)and Southern Italy (Wade, 1979).\\n10. Much of the information here is drawn from the CountyStructure\\nPlan and associated documents - Cornwall CountyCouncil, (1976a\\nand 1976b).\\nII. Ifthere isany wider connection here, it would reinforce the point made\\ninChapter4 that it might be easier for RandD workers and related\\nprofessionals to operatetheir residential preferences than it is for\\nmanagers and owners of capital.\\n12.Thestudyalso implies, ofcourse,thatalthough apleasant\\nenvironment may have helped, it would not have been sufficient to\\nrescue the coalfields. Of course, all that is being referred to here is\\nphysical environment. Cornwall still lacks the range of cultural\\namenities which seem to be a necessary condition forattracting top\\nmanagement, RandD personnel, etc. (see Chapter3).\\nChapter 6: Class, Politics and the Geography of Employment\\nI.Regional policy is by no means, obviously, the only arm of policy to\\nhave a regional dimension .Almost all policies have spatially\\xad\\ndifferentiated effects, and some sectoral ones very much so.\\n2. This difference was to become very obvious from their contrasting\\nresponses to cuts in regional policy.\\n3. The repercussions ofthis period were felt throughout the I970s. In\\n1977 at C.A. Parsons on Tyneside the power engineering workers\\nprevented the completion oftherestructuring ofpower engineering\\nbegun under the IRC, fighting off a combination of the NEB, much of\\ntheLabourGovernment - and Arnold Weinstock (see Coventry,\\nLiverpool, Newcastle and NorthTyneside TradesCouncils, 1980).\\n4. The exception in the United Kingdom to this general decline was of\\ncourseNorthSea oil, where again the regional effects weresignificant.\\nMoore, Rhodes and Tyler (1977) estimated it had generated some\\n20000 jobs in Scotland by 1976.\\n5. The criticism of location theory for being concerned only with\\ngeographical distribution does not mean thattheproblem of\\ndistribution , at a political as well as theoretical level, does not exist,\\nbut that it cannotbeadequately explained, nor adequately attacked,\\nwithout relating it to prior quotations aboutproduction . 364 Notes and References\\n6.Datafor these individual periods is inevitably all rathersparse. The\\nten-year census period bears no relation to a politico-economic\\nperiodisation.\\n7. In all cases except one (General Management in Wales) the overall\\ndeficits in these occupational groups in the North,in Scotland and in\\nWales were greater than could be \\'accounted for\\' by sectoral changes\\nwithin the regions and occupational changenationally within the\\nsectors (Kirwan, 1981)- a clear indication of the possible existence of\\nhierarchical spatial structures .\\n8. What would beinteresting would be to investigate the components of\\nthis relative loss. Kirwan\\'s (1981)analysis indicates that whilenational\\nchanges in occupational structure byindustrywould have indicated an\\nincrease in femaleassembly work in the Development Areas, the areas\\'\\nown changes in industrial structure would imply a considerable\\ndecline. The specifically regional residual component, though small,\\ndid not show such biglossesand in Scotland it actually increased.Such\\nan analysis of numerical components cannotlead to an explanation in\\nterms of process. But the patternto which it points, and which could\\nbe investigated, is that there was a greater closure rate of\\'cloned\\'\\nbranch plants - such as in clothing - than of branches at the bottom\\nends of production hierarchies. Certainly, in all the industrial\\nDevelopment Areas the regional component of the 1980 distribution\\nremains firmly positive.\\n9. In all cases, moreover, this increase was indicated by both industrial\\nstructure and regional factors. Again, this was a contrast with the\\nregionsofthe south and east where in each case while industrial\\nstructure indicated an increase, the residual regional component was\\nnegative.\\n10. These electoral characteristics are drawn from an analysis of both\\nopinion pollsand election results in Kellner, 1979.Analysis ofthe 1983\\nelection reveals many of the same trends (Massey, 1983).\\nII.Examination evenofsimplepatterns of voting behaviour makes the\\npoint clearly. Forthe whole period from the sixties to the eighties\\nvotingbehaviour in general elections varied noticeably by region. In\\nsome elections,such as that of 1964, the \\'influence\\' ofregion on social\\xad\\nclass voting patternswas greater than variations due to inter-regional\\ndifferences in class structure (Butler and Stokes, 1975). Forthe 1970\\nelection Butler and Stokes (\\\\975) compared precisely the two kinds of\\nareas examined in Chapter5- mining seatsand resort areas.Table A.I\\nreproduces their breakdown of classcomposition , byoccupational\\ngrade, in the two kinds of constituencies, and the results of their\\ninquiry as to \\'class self-image\\'.The difference between the two kinds of\\narea on both counts- and on the relation between the two - is clear.\\nThere is a wide difference in social structure between the two kinds of\\nconstituency , but this is not enough to account for voting differences:\\n\\'the much more spectacular difference has to do with the behaviour of\\nthe classes. The Conservatives actually outranLabouramong the\\nworking class ofresort areas . . . In the mining seats, however, the\\npicture is almostreversed.

In all these cases, of course, the rhetoricwas again tougherthan the\\naction. Subsidies to nationalised industries (the NCB, BSCand BL in\\nparticular) continued, and theCabinetbacked off from a confronta\\xad\\ntion with the regional core of the labourmovement - the miners.\\n13. This is no longer the case for all of Tootals- it wasannounced in May\\n1982 that the headquarters of thethreadmaking section had been\\ntransferred , not tosouth-east England but to the United States!\\n14.Itshould be added thatNEI has been trying to diversify, for instance\\nthroughatakeover of Extel (Duffy, 1982).\\n15.Itis not being suggested that these characteristics are universal. There\\nare exceptions even in the \\'traditional sectors\\'. Boswell (1973) reports\\non thecomparative dynamism of small capital in hosiery and knit\\xad\\nwear, for instance (p. 206).\\n16. This is not to imply thatall small firms and self-employment in the\\nSouth East are of the \\'modern\\' variety. Both traditional and modern\\nelements are found in thatregion and there is a distinct division\\nbetween them (Brimson et al.,1981).\\n17. In all the industries discussed here there are also majorcompanies ,\\noftenmultinationals, involved.\\nChapter8: Reflectionson Debates over a Decade\\nI. The degree to which this pointis developed in Spatial Divisions of\\nLabouris limited. Pointers to a way forward have been given in\\nJackson(1991) and Pratt(1991). This is anotherarea of work which\\nhascontinued to develop over the last decade.\\n2. There is a whole range of publications here, the most immediately\\nrelevant to the debateat this point being Warde(1985), Bagguley et al.\\n(1990) and Murgatroyd et al.(1985).\\n3. While on this point,it is relevant to note thatthere is not meant to be\\nin thetheoretical approach ofSpatial Divisions ofLabourany\\nimplication thatlabourisnecessarily always or at any particular\\ntime the most significant factor in capital\\'s search for profitable\\nlocations (see,for a contrary interpretation, Warde, 1985). In the cases\\nanalysed in the preceding chapters labourwas in fact especially\\nsignificant, but this will not necessarily be the case (seefor an analysis\\nwhich brings out otherconsiderations, Morganand Sayer, 1988).\\n4.Conceptualising phenomena in this way also links in to otherdebates\\nwithin the social sciences, for instanceon identity and the constitution\\nof political subjects (Massey, 1994).\\n5. The research reported in Massey, Quintas and Wield (1992) also\\nsupports, again for scientific and associated workers, an increasing\\ndegree of professional isationamongthelattergroup, mostparticularly\\nthroughcredentialism .\\n6. Some of these issues are being approached in an ESRC research\\nproject (no. R000233004): High statusgrowth? Aspects of home and\\nworkaroundhigh-technology sectors. Notes and References 367\\n7.Thanksto Andrew Sayer for raising this issue. To be precise, some\\nreference is made, most especially to systems ofsubcontracting\\nbetween firms, but here again the point is that there are strong\\nelements of real controlthough not exercised throughlegal ownership\\n(adistinction emphasised throughout the book).\\n8.Itisperhapsworth briefly commenting here on Walby and Bagguley,\\n1989. This article aimed to take issue both with Spatial Divisions of\\nLabourand with the work of othersonquestions concerning gender\\nrestructuring .The prime target was critiqueof thetheoryof the reserve\\narmy of labour. Unfortunately , however, the article mistakes the\\nintention of our work. First, its argument generalises from a particular\\nmoment. Second, it is ambivalent as to whether Spatial Divisions of\\nLabourand Massey and Meegan (1982) do or do not employ the\\ntheory of the reserve army of labour. After some twisting and turning\\ntheauthorsdecide that we do but only in a truncated version. The\\ntruthisthatwe do not, though the use of the term \\'reserve\\' must be\\nconfusing on this score. The point, however, is thattheirsubsequent\\ncritique does not apply, and indeed their own statistical analysisof sex\\xad\\ntyping is vulnerable to analysis along spatial-division-of-labour lines\\n(thatis, they assume intrasectoral labour-process similarities between\\nregions). Further, it is a strange assumption thatpatriarchy always\\nleads to closure of occupations to women: it can work in otherways\\n(for instance ghettoisation) .Third,and in a curious reversal ofthe first\\npoint, they write of phenomena which are \\'contingent, thatis,\\ninexplicable\\' (p. 290). As should be clear from all thathas gone\\nbefore,contingency absolutely in no way implies inherent inexplic\\xad\\nability.\\n9. There is a more complex reading which it is possible to make which\\nstresses the historical character ofnatureas well as of the social. But\\nagain, Marx and Engels are ambiguous here, their broadertheoretical\\npropositions not really being rigorously carried throughinto the actual\\nanalyses. Moreover, DonnaHaraway\\'s reading of the same work\\ncomes to the same conclusions as did mine (see below).\\n10. In the same context she also says \\'thisinsight, I will argue here, also\\nforces us to develop analytical perspectives thatarecognizant of\\nagency in human history, and which are, therefore, empowering\\'\\n(p.60).\\nII.See also Massey (1994) and furtherreferences therein.\\n12.

Itbegan life as a\\ncontribution to adebatewithin the branchof geography known as\\n\\'industrial locationtheory\\'- as what I hopedwould be a trenchant\\ncritique of all, or prettymuch all, thathad gone before, together\\nwith a second halfwhich would present \\'analternative approach\\' . A\\nnumberof things have happened in the period since then. I got\\nbored with the critique. The second \\'hairbecame the length of a\\nbookin itself, and it also changed itsnature.Frombeing a\\nschematic outline it became increasingly grounded in what was\\ngoing on in Britain and in otheradvanced capitalist countries.\\nBut more thananything else I became increasingly convinced of\\ntheimportance ofthe issues involved and of the fact thatthey\\nshould have a wider audience. My basic aim had been to link the\\ngeography ofindustry andemployment to the wider, and under\\xad\\nlying,structures of society. And one of the things I do in the bookis\\npresentanapproach which,Ihope, makes thatpossible. The initial\\nintention, inotherwords, was to startfrom the characteristics of\\neconomy and society, and proceed to explain their geography . But\\nthe more I got involved in the subject, the more it seemed thatthe\\nprocess was not justone way.Itis also the case - I would argue \\xad\\nthatunderstanding geographical organisation isfundamental to\\nunderstanding an economy and a society. The geography of a\\nsociety makes a difference to the way it works.\\nIf this istrue analytically,it isalso true politically. Forthere to be\\nany hope ofaltering thefundamentally unequal geography of\\nBritish economy and society (and thatofothercapitalist coun\\xad\\ntries, too), a politics is necessary which links questions of geogra\\xad\\nphicaldistribution to those of social and economic organisation .\\nEffectivelyto confront the spatial inequality in Britain today means\\ntakingon much the same battles - and much the same social strata\\xad\\nas isnecessary to win any wider progressive change. But it isequally\\ntruethatany wider national politicalstrategymust be sensitive to\\nthevariations in economic structure, inoccupations , in political\\ntradition and in the fabric of day-to-day life which exist between\\ndifferent partsof thecountry.\\nx Preface xi\\nI have had a lot ofhelp and supportduringtheproduction ofthis\\nbook. Mostofthebookwas written while I was the SSRC Fellow in\\nIndustrial Location Research, and I shouldlike tothanktheSSRC\\nand its staff. The development of the ideas and arguments has been\\naided and stimulated by many friends and colleagues over a number\\nof years.Itwould be impossible to mention everyone by name.\\nWhathas been best abouttheprocess has been the gradual\\ndevelopment ofa practice which at least tries to argue without\\nscoringpoints,and to criticise by being constructive .Fortheir help,\\nparticularly in the final stages, however, I shouldlike tothank\\nMichael Ball and Huw Beynon, who read the manuscript, Nancy\\nMassey for typing it magnificently, and a numberoftimes,Richard\\nMeegan, my co-worker for many eventful years, and Ron Martin.\\nFacultyofSocial Sciences\\nThe Open University\\nMilton Keynes, EnglandDOREEN MASSEY Preface to the Second Edition\\nWhen the idea ofa second editionofSpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwas first suggested to me, some time ago, I was reluctant initially to\\ntake it up. Above all I was unsureofthe form which it shouldtake.\\nThe first editionofthebookwasstimulated inpartbyempirical\\nchanges, by thegreatshifts which began to take place in regional\\n(i.e.sub-national) economic and social geographies in the first\\nworld,fromaboutthe middle years ofthe 1960s. Such changes\\nwereimportant - they affected the lives ofpeople in cities and\\nregions across large partsofthe world. But the message I wantedto\\ndrawfrom those changes was most importantly theoretical. The\\nidea was to communicate a wayofunderstanding uneven geographi\\xad\\ncal development, ratherthantoadvance aninterpretation ofthe\\nshapeofthe world at some particular moment. Thelatterwas\\nimportant too but it was, as much as anything, a vehicle for a more\\ngeneral message. The arguments concerned, above all, the way in\\nwhich we conceptualise economic and to some extentmoregeneral\\nsocial space, abouthow we understand the differences andstruc\\xad\\nturesofinequality within it, and abouthow we might begin to think\\noftheeconomic identities of unique places.\\nThese issues, it seems to me, remainimportant. Muchofthe\\nargument ofSpatialDivisions ofLabourhas been widely accepted\\namonggeographers . But there remain ambiguities and(as they seem\\nto me!)misunderstandings. Moreover, since the time of the first\\neditionthere has been wide-ranging debate,discussion, notto say\\ncontroversy, inpartsparkedby thebookitself, in partoriginating\\nelsewhere butwithinwhich the bookhasnevertheless become\\nembroiled. As Ann Markusen and Ron Martinpointout in their\\nrecentassessments of thebookanditscareer(Progress inHuman\\nGeography, 1993),some ofits waysofarguingforeshadowed issues\\nonly now emerging more broadlyon to the agendaofintellectual\\ndebate.Theyare,moreover, issues which go way beyond the\\ndiscipline ofgeography to engage with currents ofargument \\xad\\naboutspatiality, location and place, aboutuniqueness, contingency\\nand modes oftheorising - nowpreoccupying a wide range ofthe\\nhumansciences.\\nXll Preface Xlll\\nIttherefore seemedappropriate for a second editionto be focused\\non these debates,and on an exploration ofthetheoretical argument\\nof the book in the contextofsomeofthediscussions ofwhich over\\nthe last decade ithas been partand in the light ofsubsequent\\ntheoretical developments . The body ofthebook,fromChapter 2 to\\nthe original \\'Postscript\\', therefore remainsunchanged except for the\\ncorrection ofsomeminortypographical errors.However, boththe\\nfirst and last chapters ofthiseditionare new and,as well as\\nconsidering recentchanges in thenatureandformofuneven\\ndevelopment, mostcentrally take on this task ofmakingmore\\nexplicit the key theoretical arguments andmethodological stances\\nof thebookand of setting them in the contextofwidercurrent\\ndebate.The new first chapterreassesses the purposeandbroadform\\nof thebookand pulls out the issues which are mostimportant and\\nwhich have become foci ofsubsequent debate. The new last chapter\\nprovides adetailed commentary on the text underthesemajor\\nheadings. It ishopedthatthis will clarify some ofthebook\\'s\\npositions andintentions and set them in a wider context, thatin\\nparticular it will make the bookmore helpful for teaching purposes\\n(bytracingthreadsofargument as theyappear- astheoretical\\nstatement or inconcrete use - indifferent partsofthebook),and\\nthatitwillprovoke yetfurtherdiscussion on issues which remain of\\ncentralimportance .\\nIshould like to thankmypublisher StevenKennedy forgoading\\nme into this, and for his continued advice and cheerful encourage\\xad\\nment. Ishouldalso like to thankJohnAllen, Allan Cochrane and\\nAndrew Sayer for helpful comments and much discussion . In the\\nten years since I wrote the first editionofSpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nI have been working at the Open University . It is a place which has\\naperhapsuniqueandcertainly verycollaborative andcooperative\\nwayofworking. My colleagues there, most particularly in Geo\\xad\\ngraphy,have been a constant source of new ideas and of intellectual\\nstimulation, and I am grateful forthat.Ishouldfurtherlike to\\nthankDoreenWarwick and Margaret Charters, alsoofthe Open\\nUniversity, for typing the material for this second edition.\\nDOREEN MASSEY ListofTables\\n4.1Changes in the sectoral distribution of employers and\\nself-employed within services, between 1961and 1975 171\\n4.2Self-employment as apercentage oftotalsectoral\\nemployment, by region, in 1975 173\\n4.3Thepercentage of UK research establishments in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, 1968 182\\n4.4Employment-based location quotients for office\\noccupations, 1971(England and Wales) 186\\n5.1Industrial jobscreatedin Wales, 1977 197\\n5.2Economic activity rates in industrial southWales and\\nGreatBritain 203\\n5.3 Age-specific activity rates for men, 1971: a\\ncomparison between regions 205\\n5.4Workers living in Rhondda in 1966 but working\\nelsewhere 215\\n6.1Someemployment characteristics of the\\nmodernisation period 242\\n6.2 Some employment characteristics ofthe mid-1970s 248\\nA.I Class composition and class self-image ofmining and\\nresortareas, 1970 (in percentages) 365\\nA.2Partisan self-image by class in mining areas and\\nresorts,1970 (in percentages) 365\\nxiv ListofFigures\\n2.1 A basic framework\\n3.1Managerial hierarchies andrelations ofownership\\nand possession: a basic shape\\n3.2The division oflabourinproduction inpartsof\\nelectronics\\n3.3Threelocations showing three different spatial\\nstructures\\n3.4 Three different part-process possibilities\\n3.5Occupations, relations and social classes\\n5.1 The acclimatisation oflabour\\n5.2 . . . and the acclimatisation ofmanagement\\n6.1 The role of regional policy in the National Plan\\n6.2Competition between areas\\nxv30\\n70\\n71\\n75\\n76\\n107\\n207-8\\n209\\n238-9\\n252 ListofAbbreviations\\nAUEW\\nBLMC\\nBSC\\nCBI\\ncOP\\nCIDA\\nCPSA\\nCSO\\nDEA\\nEAG\\nEC\\nECSC\\nEDC\\nEEC\\nESRC\\nHMSO\\nIDC\\nILAG\\nIMF\\nIRC\\nLOB\\nMP\\nNALGO\\nNCB\\nNEB\\nNEDO\\nNUFLAT\\nNUGMW\\nNUM\\nNUTGW\\nOECDAmalgamated UnionofEngineering Workers\\nBritish Leyland MotorCorporation\\nBritish Steel Corporation\\nConfederation ofBritishIndustry\\nCommunity Development Project\\nCornwall Industrial Development Association\\nCivil and Public Services Association\\nCentralStatistical Office\\nDepartment ofEconomic Affairs\\nEconomists Advisory Group\\nEuropean Community\\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community\\nEconomic Development Council\\nEuropean Economic Community\\nEconomic and Social Research Council\\nHerMajesty\\'sStationery Office\\nIndustrial Development Certificate\\nInquiryintoLocation Attitudes Group\\nInternational Monetary Fund\\nIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation\\nLocation ofOffices Bureau\\nMember ofParliament\\nNational Association ofLocalGovernment\\nOfficers\\nNational Coal Board\\nNational Enterprise Board\\nNational Economic Development Office\\nNational UnionofFootwear, Leatherand\\nAlliedTrades\\nNational UnionofGeneralandMunicipal\\nWorkers\\nNational UnionofMineworkers\\nNational UnionofTailorsandGarment\\nWorkers\\nOrganisation ofEconomic Cooperation and\\nDevelopment\\nxvi PBR\\nREP\\nROSE\\nSET\\nSICSSRC\\nTGWU\\nTUCListofAbbreviations xvii\\nPayment By Results\\nRegional Employment Premium\\nRestofSouthEast\\nSelective Employment Tax\\nStandard Industrial Classification\\nSocial Science Research Council\\nTransport andGeneral Workers\\' Union\\nTradesUnionCongress 1\\nThe Issues\\nThis is a bookaboutindustrialgeography andeconomic uneven\\ndevelopment. Itexplores themechanisms ofindustrial location, the\\nchanging formoftheinequalitiesbetween citiesandregions,andthe\\nimportance ofthesethingsto theeconomy andsocietymorewidely.\\nThisformsitsempirical focus.However, itbecameclearas I was\\nexploring these issues thatwhatweneededaboveall was a new way\\nofthinking abouteconomic space. We need, or so I arguein this\\nbook,tothinkofeconomic space as the productofthedifferen\\xad\\ntiatedandintersecting socialrelations oftheeconomy . It is with this\\nwayofconceptualising economic spacethatmuchofthebookis\\nconcerned . Such an approach influences the way we analysethe\\nlocation ofeconomic activity, the way we understand uneven\\ndevelopment, the way we conceptualise individual \\'areas(placesj,\\nandtheapproach wemaytaketoany.attempt totacklethe\\ninequality -therelations ofdominance andsubordinat ion\\xad\\ncurrently inherent inallthesethings. Let me begin, then, with the.\\ncentralnubofthisargument.\\nTo saythatsocialspaceisrelational hasbecomecommonplace .\\nButthingsaremoreeasily said thanfullyunderstood orthought\\nthrough intopractice.Tosaythatspaceisrelational meansboth\\nthatitshouldnotbeconceptualised as someabsolute (thatis to say,\\npre-existing) dimension andalsothatit isactually constructed out\\nof,is aproduct of, therelations between socialphenomena. We\\nactivelycreatespace (time -space,time-spaces) in theorganisation\\nandlivingoflife.IMoreover the way in which we do so will have its\\nimpactbackuponthestructuring ofsocietyandofourlives.\\nNow,inspiteofall thedebatethattherehas been overthe last\\ndecade, it is my feeling that- evenwithingeography, thatmost\\n\\'spatial\\'ofdisciplines, andcertainly withinindustrial geography \\xad\\nthis real meaning ofthesloganthat\\'space is relational\\' hasnot\\nbeentakenonboard.Uneven development -perhaps thecentral\\nconceptofeconomic geography\\'s fieldofenquiry - is still most\\nfrequently discussed as if it were onlyamatterofmoredevelopment 2SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nin some places than others; morejobs/investment /income here than\\nthere.Implicit in this is a notionofeconomic spaceas an\\nundulating surface, with successful high-points and less fortunate\\nlows. The argument \\'hereisthatspace can be more helpfully\\nconceptualised as theproductofthestretched-out, intersecting\\nandarticulating socialrelations of theeconomy. Notonly does this\\nintegrate \\'thesocial\\' and \\'thespatial\\'from the moment ofinitial\\nconceptualisation , it alsointroduces - directly into space itself - the\\nissueofsocial power.\\nTakea veryconcrete example. In the UnitedKingdom in the\\nearly 1990s the newspapers were full oftalkofthe collapse ofthe\\neconomy ofthesouth-east of thecountry. Equivalent debates\\nexisted in otherfirst world countries . This recession was different\\nfromprevious ones. Every week redundancies wereannounced in\\nsectors which in the previous decadehad been booming, whose\\nemployees (at least the upperechelon ones) had struttedthecountry\\nwith aself-confidence whichenraged those in otherareas(\\'the\\nnorth\\',Liverpool . . .) where the eighties economic razzamatazz\\ntooklonger to reach and was anyway fitful. The message from the\\nmedia in the early nineties was thatallthatwas over. Unemploy\\xad\\nment in the south-east was no longer even the lowest in the country,\\nthe gap between levels ofunemployment in \\'north\\' and \\'south\\'had\\nnarrowed. Mostcommentary, bothtabloidand seriously considered\\n(andincluding someacademic) ,announced afundamental change\\nin the regional geography ofthecountry.\\nSuch aninterpretation was gravely misconceived (which is not to\\ndenythattheeconomic situation in thesouth-east haddeteriorated\\ndramatically , nor to deny us northerners some grim satisfaction\\nthatthingsshouldbe so). But to try to interpret economic space\\nthroughthedistribution ofunemployment numbers (or tointerpret\\nany space simply through distributions ofsuchphenomena) is to\\nunderestimate thecomplexity of social space; most particularly it is\\nto evade readingitrelationally.\\nTo begin at the most obvious level, this interpretation does not\\ntake into account, forinstance, thequality,interestand above all\\nthepowerinherent in the very different kindsofjobsdone by those\\nwho were still in work in the different regionsofthecountry. A\\nglance at the statistics revealed yawning contrasts .Itwas thesouth,\\nespecially the south-east, which had the bulk ofthequalityjobs.\\nYet even this elaboration is still to look at distributions , to\\nconsider thespatialas anarrayoffree-floating objects - in this case The Issues 3\\njobs. (Somanymanagers here,scientists there,manual workers\\nthere.) But, I wanttoargue,whatconstruct economic spacesas\\nrelational arethesocialrelations onwhichthoseobjects/jobs\\nthemselves depend,andwhich link themtogether (ornot)intheir\\nmutualconstitution . So the existence ofvariation inkindsofjobs\\nbearswitness to thegeography ofthesocialrelations ofthe\\neconomy .Andin the light ofthatgeography thesouth-east was\\nstill in a positionofstructural dominance incomparison with,and\\nin relation to, otherregionsofthecountry. It was(andstill is) the\\nprimelocusofcontrol, ofstrategic planning, offinance,ofthe\\nresources forresearch andinnovation; it was(andstill is) the crucial\\n(andmostpolitically validated) hingein therelation between the\\nUKeconomy andtheworldeconomy .Thisisnotthesamethingas\\nsayingthatitsunemployment ratewas low or thateveryone in it\\nhada classyjob.Whatisbeingarguedisthatthis way oflookingat\\nthings,asspatialised socialrelations , is likely to lead to more\\ninteresting questions andmoreenlightening enquiry.Thisis a\\ngeography, notofjobsbutofpowerrelations, ofdominance and\\nsubordination, ofenablement andinfluence, andofsymbols and\\nsignification. Andit is ageography whichmatters,whichhas effects\\nbothon thepeopleofthedifferent regionsandon theeconomic and\\nsocialtrajectory ofthecountry.i\\nThisinsistence on theinterpretation ofeconomic geography in\\ntermsofthespatialorganisation oftherelations ofproduction\\n(defined in thewidestsenseofthatterm),asdistinct from the\\ngeographical distribution ofjobs, is thecentralcoreofthisbook. It\\nis,moreover , thesocio-economic aspectofamoregeneralargument\\n-thatspace(andthephenomena whichconstitute it) ismore\\nhelpfully conceptualised intermsofrelations, andspecifically\\npower-filled socialrelations, thansimplyaspatterns anddistribu\\xad\\ntionsofatomised objects.\\nThus, totakeupcentrally thesubject-matter ofthisbook,new\\nspatialdivisions oflabour(formsofeconomic unevendevelopment)\\narethorough re-workings ofthesocialrelations whichconstruct\\neconomic space(fordivisions oflabourthemselves areconceptua\\xad\\nlised asconstructed through socialrelations). Theyaremorethan\\njustnewpatterns ofemployment, akindofgeographical re\\xad\\nshuffling ofthesameoldpackofcards.Theyrepresent whole\\nnew sets ofrelations between activities indifferent places, new\\nspatialformsofsocialorganisation, newdimensions ofinequality\\nandnewrelations ofdominance anddependence .Eachnewspatial 4 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ndivisionoflabourrepresents a real, and thorough, spatialstructur\\xad\\ning. Itmarksa new form ofregionalproblem; and more basically it\\nmarksnot a new re-organisation ofrelations in space, butthe\\ncreationofa new space.\\nThe empirical focus and conceptual coreofthisbook,then,\\nconcerncertain(economic) aspects ofthat\\'impossible dichotomy\\'\\nthe social and the spatial.\\nHowever there are otherways, too, in which the booksetsouta\\ntheoretical position. Anumberofthese, while appreciated by some,\\nwere toprovoke amongothershowlsofpain, and much shock and\\nhorror. Above all, these issues turnedon myconcern with the\\nrelationship between \\'thegeneral\\' and\\'theparticular\\', the global\\nand the local(whichare notthe same as the general and the particular\\nthoughthey are frequently misunderstood to beso) and the attention\\ntoparticularity ,variability andcontingency. Over and over again in\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,particular \\'causalrelations\\' are seen as\\nenabling ratherthanasdeterminate in their effects,and forever liable\\nto bealteredin theirimplications, or even nullified, by othersetsof\\nrelations existing in the particularity oftheiroccurrence atthat\\nprecise point in time-space. The howls ofprotestcame mainly from\\nthose who detected too close a focus (for them) on contingency, on\\nvariation, on difference. Indeed on uniqueness.\\n***\\nThe first editionofthisbookwas written at a moment (the very\\nearly1980s)whichallowed it toreflectbackon themajor\\ntransformations which had been taking place since the sixties in\\ntheindustrial geography offirst world countries. Thosetransforma\\xad\\ntions form thecentralempirical focus ofenquiry, thelaboratory for\\nthereconceptualisation .Itwas also a moment whenconsiderable\\nmovement wasunderway inacademic studiesofindustrial geo\\xad\\ngraphy. In theUnitedKingdom at least, the approach through\\nneoclassical economics to modelling the locational behaviour of\\nindividual firms had been discredited. A \\'behavioural school\\'had\\nflourished for a while, to document the huge variety ofcompany\\xad\\norganisation then being recognised; but it failed to get much beyond\\ndocumentation .Throughout it all - and still today- a school of\\ncheery empiricism continued, based on censuses and surveys, and\\nunconcerned withattention totheoretical formulation orproblems\\nofconceptualisation. In 1976, the most comprehensive andauthor\\xad\\nitative review ofcurrentempirical changes reflected that: The Issues 5\\nThesevariousdeficiencies thus unfortunately nile outadoption of\\nany formal theoretical framework for this study. (Keeble, 1976,\\np.4)\\nIn response to this impasse new work had been developing , and\\nSpatialDivisionsofLabourwaspartofthatnewtrajectory. However ,\\nit had a specific bias and the beginnings ofacritique, which was of\\ncoursesubsequently tobecome muchmoregeneralised ,ofa\\nparticular formofrigid and economistic Marxism which had taken\\nsome hold in industrial studies and geography more widely.\\nThe original introduction put it thus:\\nThisbooktries tocontribute bothto some ofthesetheoretical\\nissues and debatesand to the interpretation ofwhat has been\\nhappening in the United Kingdom\\'s space-economy since the\\nearly sixties: its focus is on industrial geography . In spite ofthe\\nimpasse reached in traditional theorythere has continued to be a\\nrich vein of empirical anddescriptive work, some examining the\\ndevelopment ofindividual corporations , some, less satisfactorily ,\\njuggling with aggregate numbers andpatterns. But the period has\\nalso seen the gradualand often collective building ofaMarxist\\nschoolofthought. Forindustrial geography ispartofthe social\\nsciences and the alarming transformation ofitsobjectofstudy\\nwas not the only thing undermining itscredibility in the sixties\\nand seventies. Itwas also drawninto the revolution affecting\\nsocial sciences more generally. Itis within the second, Marxist,\\ntradition thatthis book lies. Itaims to set the changing geography\\nofindustry andemployment within the wider contextofthe\\ndevelopment ofcapitalist society and to examiaetheparticular\\ndevelopments inBritainthrough the prism oftheevolution of\\nclassandeconomic relations bothwithinthecountry and\\ninternationally . Specifically, it aims to explore the geography of\\nindustry andofjobsthrough aninterpretation ofthespatial\\norganisation ofthe social relations ofcapitalist production. Itwill\\nbe clear by the end ofthe book thatregional problems, and\\nspatialinequality more generally, have notbeenfundamentally\\nchallenged by anyoftheconsiderable varietyofpolitical strate\\xad\\ngies in force since the sixties, for none of them in the slightest\\ndegree challenged the underlying causeofthatuneven develop\\xad\\nment - the organisation ofproduction oncapitalist lines. 6 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nBut theMarxisttradition, like others, also has its variations\\nand itsinternaldebates. There are versions which look at the\\nworld as if it were merely the pre-determined productofa setof\\nlaws and tendencies. Such approaches leave little scope for real\\nconflict and struggle, still lessfor surprise and setback. They lead\\nalso to that same dichotomisation between formal models on the\\none hand and empirical description on theotherwhich plagued\\ntraditional industrial location theory. Like it, too, this version of\\nthe Marxist tradition has aproblemwithparticularity . Both have\\nan urge to normalise for the specificity of outcomes - and in\\ngeographical studies this can have majorrepercussions, for a\\nlargepartof what we are aboutisunderstanding unevenness,\\ndifference, place and locality. Finally, this version of Marxism\\ntends to be,thoughit is not necessarily, economistic .Forone\\nthing \\'the economic\\' level of society is so much easier to pin\\ndown, so much more amenable to thederivation ofabstractlong\\xad\\nruntendential developments .Andso, from the actionsof\\nmanagement to thepoliticsoftheState,explanations are\\nfrequently in terms solely of what is necessary for continued\\naccumulation.\\nTheapproach adoptedhere aims not to beinthattradition.It\\nadoptsa mode of explanation which tries to break with the\\ndichotomy between formal models and empirical description .It\\nrecognises underlying causal processes, but recognises, too, that\\nsuch processes never operatein isolation. Forit is precisely their\\noperation in varying combinations whichproduces variety and\\nuniqueness. Theparticular natureofcapitalism inspecific\\ncountries , the very different ways in which different partsofthe\\neconomy respond to the general situation ofeconomic recession,\\nthe very different impact which the entry of particular forms of\\neconomic activity can have on different regions and local areas:\\nall are\\'products ofmanydeterminations\\'. Insteadof trying to\\nnormalise for such differences , or to treatthem as merely\\ndeviations from a tendency, it is important to recognise their\\nexistence, to understand theirconstruction and toappreciate their\\neffects. British economy and society can only beunderstood by\\nrecognising its fundamentally capitalist nature. But it can only be\\nchanged - challenged politically - in its specific form. Both the\\ngeneral and the specific are essential, both to analysis and to\\naction. The Issues 7\\nThatbasicpositionstill holds good. Indeed it is appropriate, ten\\nyears on, to elaborate it.\\nFirstly, these arguments foreshadowed what was to become a\\nmuch wider debate,inpartwithinMarxism and over whetherand\\nhow some ofits basic insights could be re-thought orembedded in\\nwider fields oftheorising, inpartin the seemingly unproductive\\nclash between modernism andpostmodernism, and inpart,starting\\nearlier and proceeding more quietly, in the wealth oftheoretical\\ndebatewithin feminism. The relationship ofthebookto theselatter\\ndebates willbeconsidered in the concluding chapter;when the book\\nwas first written it was a productprimarily ofthe discussions going\\non within and aroundMarxism.\\nThefocusofSpatial Divisions ofLabour is onwhatis\\ntraditionally called\\'theeconomic \\'.Itis astudyofindustrial\\nlocation and ofthegeography ofoccupational and social struc\\xad\\nture. But the attemptis to beneithereconomistic nordeterministic .\\nItis argued thatthe study ofindustry andproduction is notjusta\\nmatterof\\'theeconomic\\', andthateconomic relations and\\nphenomena are themselves constructed within a wider field of\\nsocial, political and ideological relations. A real exploration of\\nindustrial geography takes one into historical shifts in national\\npolitics, into the vast variety ofsocial forms ofcapital,into the\\nwhole area ofgenderrelations and into many anotherwider field of\\nenquiry.\\nThe overall argument of this book is thatbehindmajorshifts\\nbetween dominant spatialdivisions oflabourwithin a countrylie\\nchanges in the spatialorganisation ofrelations ofproduction, the\\ndevelopment andreorganisation ofwhat are called here spatial\\nstructures ofproduction. Such shifts in spatialstructures are a\\nresponse to changes in class relations,economic andpolitical,\\nnational andinternational. Theirdevelopment is a social and\\nconflictual process; the geography ofindustry is anobjectof\\nstruggle.Theworldisnotsimplytheproduct ofcapital\\'s\\nrequirements .\\nSecondly, the arguments ofthebookrelate closely to thatother\\nconstellation ofdebates which has blossomed in recent years\\narounddifference, place and locality. Geography\\'s focus on place\\nand on uneven development represents its own particular way into\\nthe concern with difference and with identity which is now so\\nsalient in social sciences generally. 8Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAnd thirdly there is the related focus on the explanation of\\nuniqueness andvariability, not to the exclusion ofgeneralities but\\nas theircomplement. Thedebateon this issue has perhapsprovoked\\nmore heat than light, and has demonstrated the existence ofa\\ndisagreement between the partiesaboutthe very terms at issue\\nwhich has proved remarkably resistant toelucidation. Frommy\\npointofview, it seems thattheconcepts local,particular, and\\ncontingent (allofwhich are distinct in their meaning) remain widely\\nmisunderstood (as well as frequently conflated). The very mention\\nofcontingency still strikes fear into the heartsofthose who would\\nhavetheirworld more ordered, morepinned-down, thanthat.\\nThese issues will be explored in the final chapter, which will\\naddress some ofthe more recent debates thathavetakenplace, in\\npartprovoked bySpatial Divisions ofLabour, inpartofmore\\ngeneralprovenance .Signalling them now is to urge thatthe\\nintervening chapters be read as much for their conceptual appara\\xad\\ntus andarguments as for - if not more than for - their empirical\\nconclusions .\\n* * *\\nThefirstpartofthebook(Chapters 2and3)develops the\\ntheoretical framework. Chapter 2 deals with the most fundamental\\nstumbling-block ofall -conceptualisation. Ifwe really are to\\nunderstand spatialchangeas integral to social changeit is neces\\xad\\nsary to go back to some ofthe basics, to reconstruct someofthe\\nbuilding blocks. One obviousexample: this bookisaboutindustry,\\nbut how do we relate those easy labels used in industrial studies \\xad\\n\\'thecarindustry\\', \\'coal-mining \\',\\'theclothing sector\\'- toconcepts\\nofcapitalas a class, and more specifically to particular national\\ncapitalsas a class? Moregenerally Chapter 2 explores some ofthe\\nconnections betweenproduction and social structure beforeturning\\nto aconsideration oftherelationbetween these two and spatial\\nform. This latteris largely done in Chapter 3, which examines the\\n.rangeofvariation ofspatialstructures ofcapitalist production.\\nHere too the argument is forbetterconceptualisation - this time of\\nthegeography ofindustry itself.Towards the end, the chapterturns\\nfrom the analysis ofthegeographical organisation ofindustryto the\\nimpactonparticular places. Here the problemofconceptualisation\\nisthatofrecognising boththatparticular places are embedded in\\nwiderspatialstructures, arepartofbroader spatialdivisions of\\nlabour- a fact which they sharewithotherplaces - and thateach The Issues 9\\nlocality brings to thatsituation its own specifichistory and its own\\ncharacter .Onceagain the challenge isto hold on to both the general\\nmovement and the particularity ofcircumstance, and the final\\nsectionofthechapterelaborates elements of an approach by which\\nthis can be done.\\nThe purpose of all this reconceptualisation is to enable better\\nanalysis, understanding and action. The second partof the book\\nuses theapproach outlined in Chapters 2 and 3 to get to grips with\\nupheavals in the industrial geography of Britain between the sixties\\nand the eighties. It was a momentous period.Throughout, the\\nBritish economy was on the slide, and its international position\\nslumped. The post-war consensus was rejuvenated, refurbished and\\nthen thrown out. Class relations were remodelled and the social\\nstructure of thecountryunderwent a majorshift. The argument\\nhere is that the changing geography of the countrywas an integral\\nelement in all this.\\nChapter 4 begins by setting the broad scene, sketching in the\\nlonger-term contextof economic structure and class relations,\\nlooking at Britain both as a capitalist society and as a particular\\ncapitalist society.\\nFrom then on the analysis takes a numberofdifferent slices\\nthroughthe problem. The rest of Chapter4 uses the concepts of\\nspatialstructure to analyse the quite dramatic transformations in a\\nnumber of major sections of the economy. In the end the primary\\ninterest is in employment, and occupational and social structures \\xad\\nin spatial divisions of labour.Forthat reason, the focus here is on\\nlabour,on changes in the spatial structure of thelabourforce,\\nchanges in the use oflabourinproduction, andlabouras a\\ndeterminant , both as a \\'location factor\\' and as an active agent, of\\nindustry\\'s choice of location. Intensified economic pressures, in\\nvarious forms throughout the period, broughtwith them changes in\\nproduction process, shifts in the use of labour,attempts to search\\nout cheaper and lesscombative workers, and enormous reorganisa\\xad\\ntionsofgeographical form.\\nAll this had dramatic effects on particular places. In some the\\nprevious economic base was removed; in others it was substantially\\ntransformed . And just as the causes and shape ofindustrial change\\ndo not lie wholly within \\'the economic\\', so the impact of industrial\\nchange has far wider repercussions than simply the percentages\\nemployed in different industries, or not employed at all. Chapter5\\ntakes up this regional focus and looks at the kind of industrial 10SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nchange analysed in Chapter4, but from the point of view of some\\nof the places most affected by it. In particular thechapterexplores\\nthe major implications thatchanges in industrial geography had for\\nsocialstructure and gender relations in particular parts of the\\ncountry. Quite deliberately the chapterexamines these issues in the\\ncontext of two very different types of area, but areas which in the\\nsixties and seventies were on the receivingend of the same general\\nnational change - the decentralisation of jobs\\'forwomen\\' to\\nsmaller towns and peripheral regions.Whatthe analysis shows is\\nhow different the impact ofthis process was in the different regions.\\nIn spite of their being embedded in similar places in the new spatial\\nstructures ofproduction, the areas retained their differences, their\\ncharacters changed underthe impact of the same national process\\nand yet remained quite distinct. As in each of these chapters on\\nBritain, then, the analysis is not only concerned to produce a new\\nperspective on changes under way;it is also the vehiclefor a deeper\\ntheoretical argument.\\nInChapter 6 the political levelis examined more closely. From\\nWilson to Thatcher anumber of very different political and\\neconomic strategies were adopted in the UK. Chapter 6 argues\\nthateach of these strategies had very different geographical\\nrepercussions, each pushing forward differentially particular ele\\xad\\nments of the decline ofthe old spatial division of labourand the\\nemerging dominance ofthe new. The second halfof thechapter\\nassesses the state of play - the new geography ofclass in the early\\neighties.\\nChapter7, originally the Postscript to the first edition, picks up\\nfrom these issues of class and begins by emphasising the changing\\nnatureof regional inequality as it presented itselfin the early 1980s.\\nItis deeply to be regretted thatthesubsequent decade was to\\ndemonstrate beyonddoubtone of the theses emphasised in the\\nchapter,for if ever a decade exemplified the argument thatspatial\\n(or indeed other) inequality may be, not a productof differential\\ngrowth or decline, but integral to certaintypes of growth itself, it\\nwas the eighties. Today,in the mid-1990s thatpointhas still not\\nbeen made forcefully enough. Finally, the chapterreflects again\\nupon the politics ofchange and argues the need- emerging from all\\nthe previous theoretical and empirical argument - to address (and\\nchallenge) not spatialdistributions in themselves but the natureof\\nthe social relations which constitute them and this bothin termsof\\ntheir general character as capitalist and in terms oftheirparticular The Issues II\\nform in any given situation. With regard to the United Kingdom\\'It\\nalso means challenging the social power ofcertainstrata. . . in\\nparticular theupperechelons of white-collar hierarchies, manage\\xad\\nrial,professional and technical, and those who occupy and maintain\\nthe archaic structure ofthe British establishment in itsbroadest\\nsense\\' (p. 294). And, as has been argued throughout thebook, the\\ndifferential power relations of UK society are in partmaintained by\\ngeography - by the structuring ofsocial space.\\n* * *Finally, by way of introduction, are one or two definitions the\\nsignificance ofwhich may alreadyhavebecome apparent. By\\nindustryismeantall economic activity, all forms ofpaid employ\\xad\\nment. The term is notused only to refer to manufacturing; indeed a\\nlargeelementofChapter 5 revolves aroundaprimary sector\\nindustry (coal-mining) and a long section in Chapter 4 is specifi\\xad\\ncallyconcerned with service industries .Second, the term regiondoes\\nnot necessarily refer to standard regions, the majoradministrative\\ndivisions ofthecountry, but to any sub-national areaofany size.\\nOneofthearguments ofthe book is thatthe size,shapeand detail\\nof spatial variation andinequality in the UK underwent over the\\nperiod a thorough refashioning. Whatis more, this spatialchange\\nwas not justanoutcome ofeconomic restructuring and social\\nrecomposition; it was integral to both.The phases ofdevelopment\\nofspecific societies have particular geographical forms.Periodsof\\nmajoreconomic and social change are often also periodsofmajor\\nspatialchange. And it is one ofthecentralarguments ofthebook\\nthattheimportance ofacountry\\'s geography to its social and\\neconomic reproduction, andchange, has been for too long under\\xad\\nestimated. 2\\nSocialRelations andSpatial\\nOrganisation\\n2.1 The debate\\nKeeble\\'s assessment in the mid-1970s of the state, and particularly\\nof the empirical usefulness of industrial location theory was entirely\\ncorrect. Empirical enquiry into the geography of industry continued\\nbut in large partunencumbered by serious theoretical reflection or\\nattention to problems ofconceptualisation. One of the commonest\\nempirical methods was(andunfortunately still is) the simple\\nconfrontation oftwo maps, one representing cause, the other\\neffect. The effect, the phenomenon to be explained, might be a\\ngeographically-differentiated patternof employment change. The\\nmethodof establishing cause was to draw up the same map-outline\\nbut this time showing the geographical patternofareacharacter\\xad\\nistics (location factors) which werehypothesised to be influential in\\nproducing the distribution of employment growth or decline. The\\ndataon the two maps were then correlated and theproduction of a\\nset of significant coefficients was assumed effectively (after all the\\nusual caveats) to imply cause. The location factors in one map (the\\ncharacteristics of areas) were deemed to explain the patternof\\nemployment change in the other. More generally, and leaving aside\\nthe obvious \\'correlation-does-not-imply-cause \\' objections, geogra\\xad\\nphicalcharacteristics were taken to be a significant explanation of\\ngeographical d istributions.\\nThisapproach came under attackin the1970sfrom a number of\\ndirections. Most obviously, it was pointed out thatspatialpatterns\\nare not necessarily the result of spatial causes. Even a highly\\nsystematic spatial pattern,a clear geographical regularity, cannot\\nbe assumed to have a geographical cause. Such questions were\\nargued out over real issues. One of them concerned regional policy.\\nThe second half of the 1960shad witnessed a not inconsiderable\\nrelativedecentralisation ofproduction activities in Britain away\\nfrom the \\'central\\' regions of the south-east and midlands and\\n12 Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 13\\ntowards theperipheral regionsofthenorthandwest.The\\ndecentralisation coincided in time with a significant increase in\\nthestrength of regional policy. Regional policy at thatperiod\\nconsisted ofa setof\\'carrots and sticks\\' distributed aboutthe\\ncountry.Itwasdesigned tochangethegeography which an\\nindustrialist faced when makingalocation decision.Itwas, in\\notherwords, a spatialfactor, and it was soon claimed as the\\nprimary explanation for the changing spatialdistribution of\\nindustry; ageographical change in one thing producing a geogra\\xad\\nphical change in another.Itwas, however, pointedoutthatthere\\nmight be more to it than this. Perhapsthelocational requirements\\nofindustry hadaltered,as a result ofchanges in the process of\\nproduction .Without necessarily saying regional policy was irrele\\xad\\nvant,perhaps industry wasbeginning towanttodecentralise\\nanyway. Perhaps not all the cause ofgeographical change lay\\nwithingeography itself.I\\nAnother such issue concerned the inner cities. Therewascertainly\\na cleargeographical patternhere; some ofthe highest rates of\\ndeclineofmanufacturing employment in these years were in these\\ninnerurbanareas. So many geographers (and by no means only\\ngeographers) lookedto theinnercities,totheir\\'locational\\ncharacteristics\\', for the cause ofdecline.Itwas aspatialvariant\\non the general theme ofblaming the victim (the inner cities were\\ndeclining, so there must be something wrongwith them). There\\nwere two aspects to the rejection ofthis view. First,to the extent\\nthatthegeographical characteristics of the inner cities themselves\\nwereimportant it was still necessary to go behind the notionof\\nlocation factors and explain why those factors were important at\\nthat time. Locational requirements themselves are an outcome of\\nthecharacteristics andever-changing demands ofindustry. Second,\\nit waspointedoutthatdecline in the inner city might justhave\\nsomething to do with the more general state ofeconomic malaise,\\nthatinner cities were getting the worst of what was in any case a\\nbad deal. To the extent thatmanufacturing activity was shuttingup\\nshop in the face ofinternational recession and national decline the\\ncities might be suffering disproportionately, not as a result oftheir\\ncharacteristics aslocations, but because itwas in these areas that\\nwas to be found the oldest and generally least profitable production\\ncapacity. Theimplication ofboththese criticisms was that,instead\\nofpassingstraight from one spatialpatterntoanother, it was\\nnecessary to consider whyparticular location factors were impor- 14 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ntantatparticular periods(maybe the inner cities were suffering\\nbecause the demands ofindustry hadchanged) andto look at how\\nanindustrywasorganised over space (ratherthanjustseeing a two\\xad\\ndimensional surfaceofemployment). Whatboth implied, in other\\nwords, wasthatit wasimportant to step back a bit from the\\nimmediacy of the geographical question andanswer. In brief, it was\\nnecessary to look at production.\\nOfcourse, there was still the question ofwhat\\'looking at\\nproduction\\' was to mean. In the sense ofopening up the black\\nboxofthe firm even behaviourism could be said in some way to be\\ntakingmoreaccountofthe causes lying behind locational choices.\\nBut the more convincing answer was thatthe kinds oflocational\\ncharacteristics which will influence a company\\'s choiceofwhere to\\nbuild a new factory, expand,run down or close will dependon the\\nnatureanddemands ofthe process ofproduction. Inturn,changes\\ninproduction, andconsequently inlocationfactors, were arguedto\\nbe the result, not ofsomeautonomous choice by management , but\\nofwider economic and political forces, shop-floor relations within\\nthe firm, and ofthecompany\\'s reaction toboth. So, in the debate\\nover regional policy, the argument was not justthatchanges in\\nproduction were an important reason, often in conjunction with\\nregional policy,behindthegeographical decentralisation but,\\nfurther,thatthose changes were themselves often a reflection of\\nattempts to cope with a fast-changing widereconomic situation.\\nOneofthe main criticisms voiced ofthisapproach wasthatit was\\n\\'deterministic\\' .Therewas deep resistance to the idea thatwider\\nforces could be partofwhat influenced the actionsofindividual\\ncompanies, management teams, etc. It was a resistance bornnot\\nonlyofaconcern, ifill-conceptualised, for\\'individual freedom\\'r\\'\\nbut also from a fear thatthis would lead one outoftheterrainof\\nwhathadnormally beenconsidered \\'geographical\\' . We would have\\nto learn economics, maybe even sociology.\\nIn fact, the accusation was in general anyway misplaced. There\\nwas a clear insistence from the beginning that\\'macroeconomic\\nforces\\' did not automatically \\'produce\\' a response on the partof\\ncapital(see Massey and Meegan, 1979). But there was undoubtedly\\nan early tendency for analysis to lean in thatdirection withcapital\\nundifferent iatedly and mechanistically, and also often withoutany\\napparent trouble,responding to a setofforcesvariously called\\'the\\ndemands ofaccumulation\\' and\\'therequirements of the law of\\nvalue\\',whetherthese were conceived in terms ofabstractimmanent Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 15\\ntendencies ofthe mode ofproduction or in terms ofhistorically\\nspecified economic pressures. This was not only mechanistic, it was\\nalsoeconomistic . In fact, the way in which a firm copes with the\\npressures upon it depends on the kind ofcapitalinvolved, on the\\nkindoflabourwhich it faces, and on the battlebetween them. It\\nalso depends on how those pressures are defined and on how they\\naretranslated through the wider political and social context. The\\n\\'requirements\\' ofneitherthemacroeconomy northe lawofvalue\\nare sufficient to determine theoutcome.\\nProduction really is a social process and it is in thatsensethatits\\ndevelopment, including itsgeographical development, is not a\\nmechanistic outcome ofexternal forces. But thatis tochangethe\\ntermsofdebate. It is not only the personal idiosyncrasies of\\nmanagers which are at issue in the debateabout\\'determinism\\',\\nbut the fact thathistorical change comes aboutthrough social\\nprocesses and social conflict. The centralquestion is notwhether\\nmanagerial strategy, personality or skill is important: \\'Can Mac\\xad\\nGregorfVilliersfEdwardesfWeinstock makeadifference?\\' They\\ncertainly can, though only within the broader contextin which\\nthey are operating. Butindustrial location is not an issue to be\\naddressed solely in terms of managerial decision-making. Itis also\\npartand parcel ofthe much broader andcontinuing conflict\\nbetween capital and labour.Inthatsense this approach entails a\\nfardeeperrejection of\\'determinism\\'.Andanyway, to thinkbackto\\nthose empirical analyses based on correlation, what could be more\\ndeterministic than the search for a high R 2?\\nThe analysis ofproduction, and thence oflocation, must be set in\\nthecontextofbroadersocial processes, both inside and outsidethe\\nfinn itself. In ordertounderstand the causes and the significance of\\nlocation decisions - orofthegeographical distributionofan\\nindustry, the fortunes ofaparticular region, or the patternof\\ngeographical differentiation within a country as a whole - it is\\nnecessary to embed thatproblem within the broader contextof\\nwhatisgoingon in society in general. Thatmeansactually\\nconceptualising the firm, sectororwhatever is being analysed in\\nsuch a way thatit can be related to the broader structures of\\nsociety.Whatis at issue is the reproduction over space of social\\nrelations.\\nThe fact that the United Kingdom is acapitalist society means\\nthatthebroadformsofits social organisation are built aroundthe\\nclassrelations ofcapitalist production, between capitalon the one 16SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhandandlabouron theother.While it is capitalwhich essentially\\ncontrols theproduction process,bothin itsday-to-day functioning\\nandin thebroader processes ofallocation ofinvestment, the\\ndynamic ofthe system revolves aroundthecontradiction between\\nthese two classes. This is essential to all thatfollows.Itgovernsthe\\nstructure ofsociety, the organisation ofproduction and many ofthe\\nunquestioned assumptions ofdaily life. \\'Itis taken for granted,\"in\\nthe way things work\",thatprofitshouldbe thenormalyardstick of\\ninvestment in most areas ofactivity:thatthe living standards ofthe\\npropertyless majority shouldbe setprimarily by the terms on which\\nthey sell or once sold their labour. . . power is to be found more in\\nuneventful routinethaninconscious and active exercise ofwill\\'\\n(Westergaard and Resler, 1975, p. 144). But France, theUnited\\nStatesand the UnitedKingdom are alldominated bycapitalist\\nrelations ofproduction and yet there are enormous variations\\nbetween them. In Francethereis theinheritance ofa long\\xad\\nsurviving peasantry; in the United States a recent historywhich\\nhas included production underslaveownership. Neitherofthese\\nelements is present,or has played the same role in the social history\\nor the social structure ofthe United Kingdom .Noris it aquestion\\nmerelyof\\'additional\\' classes; the character ofeach class may vary\\ntoo. \\'Capital\\' in the UnitedKingdom isnotthe same as in the\\nUnitedStates. In each country too the hi storicalrelations within\\ncapital, such as between bankingandindustry, have been different.\\nIneachcase, in otherwords, thefundamental relations of\\ncapitalism developed historically underverydifferent conditions\\nand in each case, therefore , theytookondifferent forms. While an\\nabstract model of capitalism , byproviding the necessary concepts,\\nis an aid to analysis, it cannotsubstitute for the analysis itself. Each\\ncountry isdifferent ,andthesedifferences havegeographical\\nimplications .\\nIt follows also thatwithin each countrythings are more complex\\nthana simple confrontation betweencapitalandlabour.Thereare,\\nfor one thing, considerable variations within each ofthe twomajor\\nclasses.Intra-class, andnon-class division and conflict is important.\\nItinfluences the formation ofgovernment policy, it is reflected in\\nsocial and culturaldifferences between different partsofthecountry\\nand it has effects on location decisions and geographical patterns.\\nTotakeseriously \\'production as a social process\\' meansto\\ninvestigate therelation between these underlying structures and\\ntheirparticular empirical form, to investigate theactualcharacter- Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 17\\nisticsofcapitaland theparticular formofthe social relations ofthe\\nsociety it structures .\\nItis from here, then, thatwe shall start:lookingfirst at some of\\nthecharacteristics of \\'industry\\' and secondat the wider social\\nrelations ofwhichindustry is apart.On the way, the argument will\\nbroaden, reflecting bothsome more recent debatesand also my own\\ntheoretical position.Thereis a stress on the interconnections\\nbetween \\'the economic \\' andotherareas of life, a concern about\\nhow to use \\'laws ofthecapitalist modeofproduction \\' inempirical\\nanalysis, and an emphasis on the fact thatacapitalist society is far\\nmore than the capitalist modeofproduction . The section which\\nfollows those on industry and oncapitalist socialrelations picks up\\nagain the debateabouttherelation between the social and the\\nspatialandconcludes thatmaybe the arguments ofthe seventies\\nwere not quite correctafterall. Finally, an extended example, a\\nstudyillustrating and linking togethersomeoftherecurring themes,\\nconcludes thechapter.\\n2.2Characterising capital\\nThe problem\\n\\'Industry\\', then, is more thana collection of firms. Itis in general\\nterms the embodiment ofthecentralcapitalist socialrelation- the\\nexploitation oflabourinproduction. Butindustry is also highly\\ndifferentiated, andthese differences can be important. They can\\naffect political stance, investment strategyand locational decisions.\\nOnequestion, therefore , is: how can the structure ofcapital\\nownership be defined so thatlinks can be made between these\\ndifferent realms? How can the study oflocation, andofregional\\neconomic change, be made integral to a study ofUKcapitalist\\nsociety in general? Much depends onconceptualisation .\\nAlthough reservations areoftenexpressed, mostindustrial\\nlocation and regional employment studies have for long relied on\\ndividing the economy up bydistinguishing between \\'industries\\'.\\nThisapproach has,ofcourse, the supreme advantage ofbeing the\\nform in which the dataisavailable - the sectors oftheStandard\\nIndustrial Classification (SIC). On othercriteria,however, it suffers\\nfrom many problems . 18 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nSICOrder VI,MetalManufacture , provides a good example.\\nWithin this Orderare included both ofthe finer categories (mlhs)\\n311and 312(General Iron and Steel, and Steel Tubes) and mlh 313\\n(IronCastings). What they have in common is the fact thattheir\\nproduct is simple metal formed into basic shapes. Beyond that,\\nhowever, it is the differences between them which are striking. In\\nmuchoftheiron-castings industry production isorganised on the\\nbasisofshortruns and one-offjobs. Much ofit, too, is owned by\\n\\'smallcapital\\'.This is especially true ofthe craft foundries, which\\ntend to be single-plant firms, many employing less than a hundred\\nworkers, and quite a few of them less thanten. Incomplete\\ncontrast, the bulk of production in mlhs 311 and 312 is on a large\\nscale, with massive capitalrequirements, and under State owner\\xad\\nship. This is the British Steel Corporation. In terms both ofthe\\ntechnology ofproduction and of the kind ofcapitalinvolved, the\\ntwo are, therefore, very different.\\nSICOrder VII,Mechanical Engineering, includes both mlh 338\\n(OfficeMachinery) and mlh 332 (Metal Working Machine Tools).\\nOnce again these industries are very different from each otherin\\ntermsbothoflabourprocess and of capitalownership. The\\nproduction ofofficemachineryisrelatively automated and\\nroutinised , and is controlled by bigcapital,muchofit multi\\xad\\nnational. Incontrast, on these criteria,the machine tool industry\\nhas more in common with iron castings.\\nSICOrder IX,Electrical Engineering, includes a vast range of\\nindustries ,amongthem mlhs 361 (Electrical Machinery) , 366\\n(Electronic Computers) and 368 (Electric Appliances Primarily\\nForDomestic Use). All are predominantly owned by big capital\\n(indeed much ofit in the same companies) , but the difference in the\\nlabourprocess, for instance between 361and 366, is enormous.\\nFurther, mlhs361and 366 differ from 368 in terms of their place\\nwithin the overall structure of the economy. While the first two\\nindustries bothproduce commodities which are themselves means\\nofproduction, the third produces consumer goods.\\nThese differences matter.Characteristics of scale and ownership\\ncan influence a company\\'s response to changing macroeconomic\\nconditions, its relation to policy formulation and its ability to\\nrespondto policy initiatives, its degree oflocational flexibility and\\nitslocational requirements. Noris this a problem which can be\\nresolved simply by furtherdisaggregation along the lines of the SIC.\\nItis not the level ofdisaggregation which is in question but the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 19\\ncriteriathemselves. Significant linesofdifferentiation exist within\\nmlhs as well. Included in mlh 450 (Footwear) arebothahandfulof\\nlargemultinationals, oftenwithcontrol overtheirownretail\\noutlets, and a host ofextremely tiny firms run on an individual\\xad\\nproprietorsh ip basis.\\nSuch difficulties ofclassification andcharacterisation areof\\ncourse well known, and the changing structure oftheeconomy\\nhasbothmade the difficulties more evident andelicited a range of\\nresponses. Within industrial location studies, these responses have\\ntaken two main forms. On the one handa wealthofdetail has been\\nproduced , mainly by those working in abehavioural framework, on\\nthegreatvarietyofcompany type which exists. On the otherhand,\\nthere have been attempts toconstruct divisions oftheeconomy\\nbased on different, non-SIC, criteria.Both these approaches have\\nadvantages anddisadvantages. While it is important to recognise\\nvariety,recognition is notenough. With its essentially micro-level\\nandvoluntarist approach , thebehavioural school has failed to get\\nbeyond hopeful attempts ataggregation on the basis ofempirically\\nobserved similarities . Some form ofsystematisation andexplana\\xad\\ntion is necessary if the exercise is to go beyonddocumentation . It is\\nthis which is provided by the new dimensions ofdisaggregation\\nwhich have been suggested. Dimensions such as differences in\\nlabourprocess, or between \\'monopoly andnon-monopoly capital\\'\\nrepresent attempts to tie in these recognised empirical variations to\\nthe long-term development ofcapitalist economies . But, at least in\\nthe way they have been used so far, these approaches also have\\nproblems.\\nAnumberofdifferent linesofdivision, criteriaofdefinition , have\\nbeen suggested.\\nPlace in economic structure\\nOneofthe most frequently advocated ofthese is thatbased on\\n\\'placeineconomic structure\\'. Thismeansmorethansimply a\\ndescription oftheinputsandoutputsofaparticular economic\\nactivity.Itmeans aspecification ofthe way in which thateconomic\\nactivity relates, not justto its immediate marketandsuppliers, but\\nto thebroaderoverallstructure oftheeconomy. The most obvious\\nsuch division, and one which is particularly important in theUnited\\nKingdom, isthatbetween banking capitalandindustrial capital.\\nWithinindustrial capitalthere is a similarmajorstructural division 20 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbetween those partswhichproduce meansofproduction (often\\ncalledDepartment I) and those which produceconsumption goods\\n(Department II). Therelationofaparticular economic activity to\\nthis kind ofdivision has a numberofeffects. It determines how the\\nactivityfits into the reproduction oftheeconomy as a whole and it\\nmaytherefore influence, forinstance, theimpactofchanging\\nmacroeconomic conditions . It is acommonplace to see the banking\\nsectorbooming whileindustry slumps, or for capitalandconsumer\\xad\\ngoodsproduction to be growing at different rates. State policies\\ntowardsthe economy can often also reflect these divisions. Much of\\nthe State interestin andencouragement ofelectronic capitalgoods\\nin the late 1960swas a result ofthe factthatsuchproduction was\\nvital to increasing productivity inotherpartsoftheeconomy.\\nConversely, place in economic structure may influence the kind of\\neconomic policy a company wants to see from the State.\\nIn general terms, then, \\'place in economic structure\\' may be an\\nimportant determinant of the kind ofwiderpressures with which\\nany activity is faced. In their work on the inter-war andpost-war\\nperiod,Carney,Lewis and Hudson(1977)providea good example\\nofhow division along such lines can be used to analyse the\\nrelationship between macroeconomic developments andspatial\\nstructure. Theypointto thebroaddivision at thatperiod between\\nexpanding \\'Department II\\'production and astagnating \\'Depart\\xad\\nmentI\\'and relate thatto thelocational changes going on at the\\nsame time, with the bulk ofDepartment II being located in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, while the declining Department I was\\nconcentrated in thenorth. The causes ofthe shift in balance\\nbetween these two partsofthe economy were to be found in\\nchanges in the international economy and in particular in the\\ndeclineofBritain as an imperial economic power. Its effects were\\ncontradictory . On the one handtheDepartment IIindustries in the\\nsouthof thecountryneededexpanding markets, but because ofthe\\ndecline in the norththemarketthere was depressed. In this sense\\nthefortunes ofDepartment I were a constraint on thegrowth\\xad\\npotential ofDepartment II, and decline in the northon the\\nexpansion ofthesouth.On theotherhand, thebooming industries\\nofthesouthbenefited from the collapse to their north,for it was\\nthatwhichguaranteed acontinuing supplyoflabour. The\\nunemployed in thenorth,and their migration south,kept wages\\ndown and profitsup in the growing Department II industries. This\\nsituation in turn influenced the political stances takenbydifferent Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 21\\ngroupsofindustrialists, including theirattitude toStateregional\\npolicies.Carney, Lewis and Hudsonarguethat,for theindustries of\\nthesouth,thepotential ofthenorthas amarket wasmore\\nimportant thantheimpactofits decline in providing areserveof\\ncheaplabour. Thismeantthat,eventhoughtheywouldnot gain\\ndirectlyintermsoftheirownproduction locations, thecapitalists of\\nDepartment II in the southwerenevertheless infavourofattempts\\ntorevitalise thedepressed areasofthenorth. On the otherhand,\\nthis same concern fortheirmarkets onoccasion led theindustri\\xad\\nalistsofDepartment II intodirectconflict withthoseinDepart\\xad\\nmentI - the coal -owners weresometimes attacked, forinstance, as\\nbeingtoobrutalintheirwage-cutting (Carney, LewisandHudson,\\n1977,p.60).\\nAdivisionoftheeconomy intoDepartments istherefore both\\nimportant anduseful. One thingitimmediately bringshomeis the\\nrelationbetween economic structure ,spatialform,andnational and\\ninternational economic change. But on its ownthiswayof\\ncharacterising industry isinsufficient forourpurposes .First,as a\\nspecification evenofplace in the economic structure , it willusually\\nbe toobroadto bemeaningful. In thestudymentioned above,for\\ninstance, references to\\'Departments IandII\\'didnotactually mean\\nthewholeofthoseDepartments .Strictlyspeaking, therefore, the\\ntermswereinadequate definitions oftheindustries to which they\\ndidrefer. Astheauthors themselvespointout,therewere\\nDepartment Iindustries alsoenjoying very fast ratesofgrowthat\\nthisperiod.Moreover, andconversely, notallDepartment II\\nproduction, byanymeans,fellintothecategory ofnewgrowth\\nindustries .Notallconsumer goodscameoutofmodern factories\\nsheltering the new techniques ofproduction andlocatedon the\\nmajorroadsoutofLondon, or in the west midlands. Equallypart\\nofDepartment IIbutotherwise incomplete contrast were the\\ntraditional wage-good industries -industries such asfootwear and\\nhosierymanufacture .Although many; evenofthese, did consider\\xad\\nablyincrease bothoutputandproductivity overthisperiod\\n(Pollard, 1969, pp. 107-10), therewas no majorrevolution in\\nproduction technique toparallel thenewlabourprocesses in\\nmotor-car production, forinstance.Andinsteadofbrashand\\nrisingmultinationals, theseindustries were still dominated by old\\xad\\nfashioned family firms. Insteadofgreenfield sites in the outer\\nmetropolitan areaofthesouth-east, theyhadseen acenturyor\\nmoreoflocation inthesmalltownsoftheeastmidlands. 22SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nCompletely different presentcharacteristics , inotherwords, derived\\nfromcompletely different histories.\\nReference to Departments alone, then, is often too broadto\\nallowmeaningful analysis (seealso Courlet, 1977)and insensitive to\\nsuch kinds ofsocial-historical differentiation .\\nWhile the criterion of\\'placeineconomic structure\\' isimportant\\nindetermining the kind ofpressures and stimuli from the external\\neconomic environment which are faced by any particular plant, it is\\nlesssignificant in thedetermination oflocation strategy. The fact\\nthatthecapitalandconsumer-goods industries in theinter-war\\nyears were locatedindifferent regions was not due simply to the\\nfactthatthey were different Departments oftheeconomy. Clearly\\nthere may be a greaterdegree of orientation to the final consumer\\ninDepartment II,butthis is only one factoramongmany. And\\nthereis nosuchdirectlocational determinant attaching to\\nDepartment I.\\'Placeineconomic structure\\' does not ofitself have\\nmuch necessary relationtolocation. One way in which the link to\\nlocation can be made is through consideration ofthelabour\\nprocess.\\nContrasts in labour process\\nThehistorical shift incapitalist societies from one majortypeof\\nlabourprocess to anotherhas anumberofpotential geographical\\nimplications. A shift in labourprocess may involve changes in the\\nnatureand degree ofthe division oflabour,in thenumberof\\nworkers required for any given level of output, and in the kinds of\\nskills and othercharacteristics requiredofthoseworkers.Thereare\\nvariouswaysofcharacterising and periodising the development of\\nthelabourprocessincapitalist societies. In industrial location\\nstudies, whichfrequently follow the work ofAglietta (1979), four\\nphases are usually identified. The first, manufacture, consistsmainly\\nofthegathering togetherofpreviously independent workersinto a\\nfactory system. In the second,machinofacture, mechanisation is\\nintroduced and the division oflabourwithinproduction developed.\\nWithscientific management andFordism job-fragmentation is\\nfurtherincreased ,particularly alongthe lines ofseparation of\\nconception fromexecution, and the \\'flow-line\\' principle,aiding\\nthesechanges, isintroduced. in the latest phase, with the introduc\\xad\\ntionofneo-Fordisrn, fragmentation andde-skilling ofthedirect\\nworkforce (particularly through the removal ofcontrol) can be Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 23\\npushedfurtherwith the use ofelectronic information systems. Each\\nphase represents a different wayofcombining capitalandlabourin\\ntheproduction process, a different wayoforganising thelabour\\nforce, and a different kindofstratification anddifferentiation\\nwithinthatlabourforce.\\nForall these reasons, the natureofthelabourprocess can have\\nanimportant influence on location. Perrons\\' (1981)study ofIreland\\nprovides an example. She argues thateachofthe phases in the\\ndevelopment ofthelabourprocess has different implications both\\nfor theorganisation ofplantsinparticular industries and for their\\ngeographical distribution . Inbroadterms, she argues thateach\\nphase represents an increasing division oflabourbothfunctionally\\nand spatially. These locational implications are not simply logical\\nderivations . Theactualgeographical patternadopted for aparti\\xad\\ncularlabourprocess in a particular country willdependon the\\ninteraction between the requirements ofthelabourprocess and the\\ngeographical surface inherited from the pr-vious history ofthe\\ncountry. ForBritain, Perrons arguesthattheeai.ieststage \\xad\\nmanufacturing - tended to be widely dispersed throughout the\\ncountryside , the bulk ofitorganised intofactories, but with\\nhomework ing stillcontinuing to beimportant. The reason for this\\ngeographical distribution isstatedasbeing\\'toavoidguild\\nrestrictions and higher cost labourin the towns and also to obtain\\naccess to water power\\' (p. 90).Thispatternofdispersion was\\nreversed with the adventofmachinofacture. Here the use of\\nmechanical principles andpowermeansthattheconstraints\\nimposed by craft traditions are largely overcome andindustry\\nthereby freed from rural locations . This,Perronsargues,together\\nwith the need for highly developed infrastructure meantthat\\nproduction came increasingly to be concentrated in towns. In the\\nnextphasethegrowthofindustries dominated byscientific\\nmanagement andFordism saw the beginnings ofthespatial\\nseparation ofcontrolandproduction, and thegrowthofmarketing\\nactivities, the latterresulting from the expansion ofconsumer-goods\\nproduction. Together, these led to the growthofoffice-based\\nactivities and, it is argued, these replaced industry incentral-city\\nlocations, the restructured industry movingoutto thesuburbs, and\\nsubsequently, in the search for cheaperand lessorganised workers,\\nbeyondsuburbia to theperipheral regionsbothofthe home country\\nandofthe world. Finally, the adventofneo-Fordism in many ways\\nreinforces thisgeographical pattern byincreasing thespatial 24 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nseparability ofdifferent partsof theproduction process, and by\\nextending the possibility ofdecentralisation ofproduction to small\\xad\\nbatchprocesses as well as large assembly runs.\\nItmay be, then, thatthedifferent stages in the development of\\nthecapitalist labourprocess do have distinctgeographical implica\\xad\\ntions.Certainly , there is some relation between the organisation of\\nproduction andlocational requirements and degrees oflocational\\nflexibility. This does not mean, ofcourse,thatthere is a complete\\nreshaping ofalllocational patterns immediately a new type of\\nlabourprocessappearson the scene. At any given pointinhistorya\\nnumber ofdifferent labourprocesses willcoexist; it is this\\ncoexistence whichenables \\'labour process\\' to be a basis for\\ndisaggregating theeconomy, forcharacterising different partsof\\ncapital.Itis themajorcriterion operated byPerrons, whogroups\\ntogether sectors of the Irish economy on the basis of their being\\ndominated by distinct majorphases of the development ofthe\\nlabourprocess.\\nUnderstanding thenatureofthelabourprocess can help to make\\nthe link between changes in the broadpatternofaccumulation and\\nchanges in location. At the most general level,the emergence ofnew\\ntypesoflabourprocess reflects majorphases of capitalist develop\\xad\\nment, and in turn may be reflected in spatialchange. The advantage\\nofthisapproach isthatit enables the host ofdifferent technologies ,\\nandtheirassociated labourrequirements, to be seen in a broader\\ncontext.Itrelates them, and the changes which take place within\\nthem, to longer-term developments intrinsic to the relationwithin\\ntheproduction process between capitalandlabour.\\nOnce again, however, it is inadequate on its own. The growthof\\noffice-based activities, which is seen as a majorcause of industrial\\ndecentralisation, was due in partto thecompletely different fact\\nthatthe newindustries wereconsumer-based. Place in the economy,\\ninotherwords, was equally important. This being so there seems no\\nreason to elevate the labourprocess alone to pre-eminent theore\\xad\\nticalpriority.Itis, anyway, not \"labourprocess\\'whichdetermines\\nlocation, but the search after profitand the fluctuating conflict\\nbetween capitalandlabour.All kinds offactors may influence the\\nrelationbetweenlabourprocess and location.Similar processes may\\nbeoperated by verydifferent groupsofworkers. Similar assembly\\nprocesses, for example, are in some industries done by men, in\\nothersby women, in yet othersbyparticular racialgroups.The\\nlabourdemand for alabourprocess is determined not by the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 25\\nprocess itself but by a whole host of wider social and ideological\\ntraditions. Again, scientific management andFordism onlymake\\nspatialseparation ofcontrolandproduction possible. They do not,\\noutsideofparticular circumstances, determine thatit willhappen.\\nSeparation withinproduction doesnotinitselfgive rise to\\ngeographical separation. Simply to classify by labourprocesses is\\nnot to take account ofthehistorical conditions in which they\\nemerge.Forthatreason the actualway in which the criterion of\\nlabourprocess is used in the definition ofmajordivisions within the\\neconomy must be an empirical question. It must be a partof,rather\\nthan the single inputto, any analysis. But the real problem in using\\nlabourprocess as the main line ofdivide within the economy, the\\nmain way ofcharacterising partsofindustry, lies elsewhere. If the\\nobject of the exercise is to establish therelationship between wider\\neconomic and political changes and geographical change, then the\\nconceptualisation ofthe economy must be relevant to thatwhole\\nspectrum ofconcerns. While \\'labourprocess\\'does have some, very\\nbroadrelationtolocation, it is not clear thatin itself it has much\\nconnection with acompany\\'s relationto the wider socio-economic\\nand political structure .\\nAs with \\'place in economic structure\\' it is unlikely thatthe\\ncriterionoflabourprocess willbe meaningful on its own. Indeed,it\\nwill frequently be the case thatdivisions established on the basis of\\nlabourprocess will be closely related to divisions on othercriteria.\\nCourlet(1977), for instance, relates difference in labourprocess to\\nplace in economic structure. There is also, even more obviously, a\\nconnection to theorganisational structure ofcapital.Theadoption\\nofparticular labourprocesses is often governed by size ofcompany\\n(making multi-plant organisation possible, for instance), financial\\nresources (making possible the necessary investment) andmanage\\xad\\nment type, as well as the stateofplay between management and\\nlabour.\\nThe organisational structure ofcapital\\nIt is, indeed, organisational structure which has probably been the\\nfocusofmost recent enquiryingeography. Thedebateover external\\ncontrol, theproblems of\\'branch-plant economies \\', the desire to\\nstimulate indigenous growthwithinparticular areas, the political\\nsignificance of\\'small firms\\', have all ensured thattheorganisational\\nstructure ofcompanies has been a focus of attention. Whatexactly 26 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nhas been meantby the term has varied from study to study.\\nSometimes it has been considerations such asintersectoral spread,\\nmethodof finance, degree and type of internationalisation . Such\\ncharacteristics areimportant determinants of a firm\\'s political and\\neconomic, as wellas specifically locational, rangeofoptions. \\'Size\\',\\nand its associated characteristics, isprobably thedifferentiating\\nvariable on which most attention has focused, whether the distinc\\xad\\ntion has been between reflections of sizesuch as single-plant versus\\nmulti-plant firms or between \\'small capital\\'and\\'monopoly capital\\'.\\nOnce again, none ofthesecharacteristics evolve out of the blue.\\nThey are relatedtolong-term developments withincapitalist\\neconomies. The processes of concentrat ion andcentralisation are\\ntoo well known to need elaboration. Whatisimportant from the\\npointofview of the argument here isthatthey represent an\\naccretion into larger units of two aspects of production , two sets\\nof functions which stem from the fact of ownership. On the one\\nhand there is the power to allocate investment capital. This aspect\\nofownership is often called \\'economic ownership\\' . On the other\\nhand, there are the functions ofcontrolover theproduction process\\nas it exists - both the physical means of production and,through\\nthe supervisory structure,controloverlabour.To distinguish it\\nfrom economic ownership, this aspect of ownership is often called\\n\\'possession\\' . Theorganisation of the economy into larger units of\\ncapital, both through merger and takeover (centralisat ion) and\\nthroughinternalexpansion (concentration), represents an increase\\nof thecontrolby individual capitals over these functions. Centra\\xad\\nlisation represents agathering-in ofthesepowersunderthe\\ndirection of anindividual company, replacing their operation\\nthrough theunplanned relations ofthemarketby planned co\\xad\\nordination. This increasing co-ordination ofproduction under the\\nownership of large companies iswhat isat issuein debates over \\'the\\npowerofthe tophundred companies\\', and it has important spatial\\nconsequences. Itisthe extension ofcontrolby individual companies\\nover larger and larger partsof the overall relations of production .\\nBut \\'size\\', however it is measured, is not an adequate differ\\xad\\nentiator. One of the subthemes of this book is thatwhat is often\\nreferred to as \\'monopoly capital\\'is actually, from the point of view\\nof the locational issues examined here, highly differentiated. Apart\\nfrom the obvious broaddivisions - such as thatin Britain between\\nthe City and industry - there are also substantial differences\\nbetween industrial companies. There is perhaps a tendency in the Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 27\\ngeographical andlocational literature to refer to the spatial\\nproclivities of\\'monopoly capital\\'asthoughit was an undiffer\\xad\\nentiatedentity.Eitherthepetrochemicals complex, or electronics,\\nor some ambiguous combination ofthe two, is takenasparadig\\xad\\nmaticofthe whole ofmonopoly capital.In fact, as is shown in\\nChapters 3, 4 and 6, different partsofbigcapitalcan have very\\ndifferent ways ofmakinguseofspatialvariation . Thesecontrasts ,\\nmoreover, canresultin very different formsofgeographical\\ninequality.\\nTheotherinadequacy ofsize as a differentiator is what might be\\ncalled the social natureofformsofownership. Thisis seen most\\nclearly in relation to small firms. Thereis a world ofdifference, in\\nalmost every aspect oftheiroperation, between the pushy and\\ndynamic entrepreneurial capitalto be found in some relatively new\\nsectorsoftheeconomy and the quiet ticking-over ofa family firm\\nin, say, one ofthe older consumer-goods industries mentioned\\nearlier. In the first case growth,expansion, andrisk-taking are the\\nnameofthegame.\\'In the second, the concernis with survival and\\nmaybe with succession. Indeed, the concernmay be explicitly with\\nthe survival ofaparticular social form, ofthe\\'familynature\\'of the\\nfirm, for instance. Accumulation in the classic sense is not the\\ncentralpreoccupation .Growth may even be avoided or feared\\nbecauseofthe riskthatit willchange the natureofthecompany, by\\nleadingperhaps to theintroduction ofamanagerial structure in\\nplaceofindividual owner/manager control,or to the possibility of\\ntakeover. Categories such as \\'small firm\\', in otherwords, may not\\nhave much analyticalmeaning. Ifproduction is a social process,\\nthen the social natureofcapitalisoffundamental importance when\\nit comes to characterising aparticular company. Descriptions based\\nonapparently objective (because quantitative or formal) measures\\nmay completely miss all the important differences.\\nSimilar kinds ofcontrasts may exist between much larger firms,\\ntoo. The difference between a wide-ranging multisectoral conglom\\xad\\nerateand asingle-industry company is not always justoneof\\nintersectoral spread. The whole orientation toproduction and to\\ninvestment opportunities maybedifferent. Manyconglomerates are\\ninvolved essentially in a financial mode ofoperation, commitment\\ntoparticular sectorsofproduction is minimal, and investment may\\nbe shifted rapidly and frequently between industries. Production in\\ngeneralisheresubordinated tomakinga financial profit.Clearly, in\\nacapitalist economy, production isalways basically for profitin the 28SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsensethatitcould not ultimately survive withoutprofits.Thatis the\\ncriterion by which production isjudgedto be, or not to be, worth\\nwhile. But there are many different social forms by which this\\nprocess can get played out. Whatthis in turn means, ofcourse,is\\nthatin discussing a particular economy, sector or firm, it is not\\nsufficient to refer to \\'therequirements ofaccumulation\\' to explain\\nmanagerial behaviour .\" Incontrast with the financially orientated\\nconglomerate , there is a sense in which long -established, single\\xad\\nindustry companies may well see themselves as being \\'in electrical\\nengineering\\', \\'inshirt-production \\', or what have you, as much as in\\nprofitsproduction (although ofcourse in fact they are in both,and\\nin the end the lattercontrols the former). The natureofthe\\ncalculation in these companies is different. The question is not:\\n\\'where(in what industry) areprofitshighest?\\', \\'whatshall we move\\ninto?\\',but:\\'whatis themarketforgenerators?\\', say, or \\'how many\\nshirts can we produceand sellat a profit?\\'Thesectorofproduction\\nis given.Itis notjustthatin thelattercase the company has no\\nintersectoral spread, butthatwiththatattitude,thatkindof\\ncalculation, it is not going to develop one. Antony Pilkington ,\\nchairofthemajorBritish glass manufacturers with his surname,\\nwasquotedin 1982as saying thathe and his board\\'havenever even\\nthoughthalfseriously ofmoving into anything otherthanglass and\\nalliedproducts\\' . Such a company will not, therefore, evaluate a\\ngiven rate ofprofitin\\'its\\'sector in the same way as might a\\nfinancially orientated, multi-industry conglomerate .\\n\\'Organisational structure\\' ,therefore , includes botha whole range\\nofpotentially measurable variables (none ofthem on their own will\\ndo)andmore \\'qualitative\\' social characteristics. Whatis often\\nthoughtofas the\\'economic\\' levelofsociety is itself formed and\\nshapedthrough socialprocesses, andeconomic behaviour is\\ninfluenced by wider social characteristics.\\nNeitherdoes this mean, however, thatit isenoughto fall back\\ninto the behavioural-school trapofendlessdescription. The aim\\nshouldbe to grasp these kinds of characteristics anddifferentiations\\nat asociallevel,andwith an eye to longer-term historical\\ndevelopments.\\nSome conclusions\\nAlloftheapproaches justdiscussed are attempts to dojustthat.\\nEach tries to link the characteristics ofindividual firms, or partsof Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 29\\ntheeconomy , to the stage ofdevelopment and the general char\\xad\\nacteristics oftheeconomy as a whole. Each also tries to link short\\xad\\ntermchangesto long.Changes bothin thelabourprocess and in the\\ndegreeofconcentration ofindustry actuallyhappenas a result of\\nthe day-to-daycompetition between companies. But these incre\\xad\\nmental and often hesitating processes result in identifiable long-term\\nshifts.Recognition ofthis dual natureisimportant. Itis what\\nenables the detail of specific empirical studies to be understood in\\ntermsofthebroadersweepofhistory. But none ofthesecriteriaon\\nits own is adequate . All are useful, all capturesomething , but all\\nseem tostraininordertogathereverything undertheir one rubric.\\nOrganisational structure , evenelaborated , will give little direct\\nguidance as to locational strategy-labourprocess may be more\\nuseful here. But labourprocess does not in itself providea basis for\\nestablishing arelationto theworkings ofthenational economy and\\npolitical structure . Some sensitive combination ofall three criteria\\nseems most likely to form the basis for a rethought sectionalisation\\nofthe economy. As we have seen, the three are closely linked. But\\nwhichcriterion is most important andhowthey are linked are\\nempirical questions. The answers will vary between countries and\\nover time. This is the heartofthematter.Above all, the three\\ncriteriadiscussed above have often failed to providemuch enlight\\xad\\nenmentinpractice because they have been used as externally\\xad\\nprovided ,aprioridivisions. Each is a serious attemptto link day\\xad\\nto-dayevents in industriallocation to thelonger-term historical\\ndevelopments ofcapitalism, but whathasoftenbeen crucially\\nmissed out in application is realhistory. They have been used in a\\nstaticand general way, as simple, logical derivations from a mode of\\nproduction, ratherthanas theproduct ofananalysis ofthe\\nparticular capitalist society being examined . As far as industrial\\nstudiesin the United Kingdom areconcerned ,whatwe need is a\\ndivisionofBritishcapitalwhich relates not only to the longer-term\\nhistorical development of\\'capitalism-the-mode-of-production\\' , but\\nto the long and specific historyofBritishcapitalism. Withinthat\\ncontext, the aim is to make links between politics, macro-economy\\nandlocation, and the initial conceptualisation oftheeconomy must\\nbepartofthe means by which those links are established . The basic\\nunitsofanalysis mustbemeaningful intermsofthecausal\\nstructure .Mostofwhatwe have to drawon in the United\\nKingdom covers one side but not the other.Thereare investiga\\xad\\ntionsofBritishcapitalas a class, which studyitsinternaldivisions 30SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nat anational and political level (for instance Gamble, 1981)but\\nwhich do not concern themselves much with changing regional\\nbalanceor with location. And there are, of course, numerous\\nlocational studies, but which fail to relate to British capital as a\\nreal historical classand its operation in the political sphere.The link\\nbetween the two has not been established in studies ofthe United\\nKingdom. One ofthe things industrial location studies clearly need\\nis abetterconceptualisation of\\'industry\\' itself.\\n2.3Socialstructures and capitalist relations ofproduction\\nAframework\\nBut what of the internal social structure ofcapitalist production?\\nFigure 2.1 presents a framework, borrowed from Wright, which\\nallows these relations to be examined and throughwhich connec\\xad\\ntionscan bemadebetween thesocia\\'relations ofcapitalist\\nproduction and the broader structure ofsociety.Itis also a\\nframework which enables links to be made from specific functions\\nBOURGEOISIE I---r----Small employers\\nTop managers ~\\nMiddleLanagersr~;~~_;i~R~:~~~J\\nBOUOml\\nmanagers /\\nISemi-autonomousemployees\\nForem~n and line./\\nsupervisors ~\\n[;R~Z~~A~;A~~\\nFIGURE2.1A basicframework\\nSource: adaptedfrom Wright (1976,chart 8). Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 31\\nwithin acapitalist society at any pointin time, and the social groups\\nwhoperform those functions, to long-term processes ofcapitalist\\ndevelopment. The basic building blocks of a capitalist society, the\\nbourgeoisie and the working class, form the main axis. Each of\\nthese two classes isdefined in relationto theotherand by its degree\\nofcontrolover the process ofproduction, its place in the relations\\nofproduction. Thebourgeoisie is defined by having botheconomic\\nownership and possession ofthe means of production - inother\\nwords,\\'capitalists\\' control theaccumulation process through\\ndecisions aboutinvestment, decide how the physical means of\\nproduction are to be used and controltheauthority-structure\\nwithin the labourprocess. The working class is characterised by\\nthe absence ofthese kinds ofcontrol, by its exclusion from both\\neconomic ownership and possession. These are the two fundamen\\xad\\ntal, and defining, classes ofacapitalist society. It is their mutually\\ndefiningrelationship which enables the one class to exploit the other\\nand to do so in a specifically capitalist fashion.\\n***\\nBut noactualcapitalist society,ofcourse, is so simple. Forone\\nthing,neitherofthe two majorclasses will be internally homo\\xad\\ngeneous. Within the working class there are, for instance, the lines\\nofdivision between skilled and unskilled which figure so promi\\xad\\nnently as a condition ofthe location patternsofindustry. At times\\nindustries may beeffectively rootedto aparticular locationby long,\\noftengenerations-long , experience amongst thearea\\'sworkingclass\\nofworking inthatsector. Changes in production which\\'free\\'an\\nindustry from this tie may free it not only in terms of the labour\\nmarketbut also geographically . The way the skilled and unskilled\\noperateas\\'location factors\\' may also be very different. In some\\ncircumstances, skilledworkersmay exert a pull simply on account\\nofavailability, while unskilled workers may have to compete by\\nbidding down their wages. One important factorbehind the recent\\nperipheralisation ofproduction in many industrialised capitalist\\ncountries (as well as internationally) is often arguedto be the\\nreleaseofindustry from ties to traditional labour,and its acquisi\\xad\\ntion thereby ofa newgeographical flexibility.\\nDifferences such as these within the labourforce (and therefore in\\nthe\\'spatialsurface\\'whichcapitalfaces) are in partderived from\\ndevelopments in thedivision oflabourandtherelations of\\nproduction . The general role oftechnical changeinengendering 32 Spatial DivisionsofLabour\\nthe emergence ofnew elements in the workforce is well recognised\\neven if its precise form is disputed. Changes in labourprocess and\\ntechnology areboththeoutcome of social relations and the basis\\nfor thecreation ofnew forms ofsuchrelations. At the most\\nimmediate level, technical change in the production ofparticular\\ngoods is partofthe process of capitalist competition, and it has at\\nleast two main kinds ofimpetus, on the one handto lower costs of\\nproduction and on the otherto increase the degree ofcontrolby\\nmanagement over the work process itself. The two aspects are\\ncloselyintertwined. Both, too, are long-term andgradually-evolving\\nprocesses, and have takenplace in different ways at different\\nperiodsofhistory. In the earliest days ofcapitalism theindividual\\ndirectproducers, especially those working incottageindustries,\\nretained a high degree ofcontrolover how fast, and for how long,\\ntheyworked. Oneofthereasons behindtheorganisation of\\nproduction into factories was the need on the partofthe owners\\nofcapitalto gain morecontrol over the production process\\n(Marglin, 1974).\\nOneofthe ways by which bothproductivity andmanagerial\\ncontrolhas been increased is throughthefurtherelaboration ofthe\\ndivisionoflabour: thedevelopment ofthe technical division of\\nlabourwithinproduction .Perhaps the most celebrated aspectof\\nthis has been the dual process ofseparating thefunctions of\\nconceptualisation from those of execution, andoftheincreasing\\nfragmentation ofthe tasks ofexecution. Itis this kind ofprocess\\nwhich is referred to in the term \\'deskilling\\', and the classic form can\\nbeschematised as thebreakdown ofa task, which previously\\ninvolved thinking thejobthrough, organising it andactually\\ncarrying it out, into two separate jobs: in one the task is set up\\nand in the otheractually performed . Thisdevelopment therefore\\ninvolves the creationofa whole hierarchy ofjobsdifferentiated\\nfrom each otheron anumberofdifferent dimensions . There is the\\ndimension fromconceptualisation to execution - from, for instance,\\ndesignengineering andpartsprogramming tomachine codingand\\nmachine operating in the setting up and working ofnumerically\\ncontrolled machine tools. There is the h ierarchy of degrees of\\nindividual jobcontrol. In some jobs, especially where the overall\\nwork process is based aroundautomatic machinery, there is very\\nlittle flexibility for the individual workerin the way the jobis timed,\\nperformed or generally organised . On the otherhandthere is also a\\nwhole range ofjobsincluding research work, varioustypes of SocialRelations andSpatialOrganisation 33\\ntechnical employment and skilled engineering jobs,which involve a\\nrelatively high degree ofautonomy inrelationto the work process\\non thepartoftheindividual employee.\" Norare skills and\\nautonomy equatable. Some relatively skilled jobsleave very little\\nroom for the individual workertoorganise the work process; some\\nvery unskilled jobsareprettymuchoutsidethedetailedminute-by\\xad\\nminutecontrolofbothmanagement andmachinery . These are by\\nno means the only ways in which the capitalist labourprocess\\nchanges over time. Norare such processes as dichotomisation and\\ndeskilling as linear and monotonic as issometimes made out.\" For\\none thing they may be resisted, for another technological change\\ncan beaccompanied by all kinds ofdifferent implications for the\\nconstitution oftasks within production . New skilled jobsmay be\\ncreated. And no task is entirelydevoidofnon-routine operations\\n(even if only because things go wrong, machines breakdown) or\\nmental activity. But these are processes which at varioustimes(and\\nplaces) have been important.\\nWhatissignificant aboutthem in this argument, as examples of\\nchanges in the process ofproduction, isthattheseparating outof\\ndifferent partsofthe overall work process can come to be mirrored\\nin aparallel setofsocialgroups, eachperforming different\\nfunctions. This is not, it shouldbepointed out,in any sense\\ntechnically necessary. Afterall, one skilled machinist used to do the\\njobnowperformed by thecombination ofpartsprogrammer,\\nmachine coderandmachine operator.\\nThe unity ofthis process in the handsofthe skilled machinist is\\nperfectly feasible, andindeed has much to recommend it, since\\nthe knowledge ofmetal-cutting practices which is required for\\nprogramming isalreadymastered by themachinist. Thusthere is\\nnoquestion thatfrom apractical standpoint there isnothingto\\nprevent themachining processundernumerical controlfrom\\nremaining theprovince ofthetotalcraftsman [sic].Thatthis\\nalmostneverhappens is due, of course, to theopportunities the\\nprocess offers for the destruction ofcraftand thecheapening of\\ntheresulting piecesoflaborinto which it is broken(Braverman,\\n1974,p.199).\\nThedifferent tasks are allocated todifferent typesofworkers.Inthe\\nUnitedStates,Braverman reports,thepartsprogrammer is increas\\xad\\ningly ajuniortechnical college graduate, themachine codera\\'girl\\',\\nand the operator a semi-skilled male. This hierarchy replaces the 34SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\noneco-ordinated function of skilled machinist. Italso reflects a lot\\nmore than simple \\'technical requirements\\' . The new arrayofjobs\\nnot only draws on existing differences within the workforce, but\\nalso helps to create and reinforce them. Changes in the organisation\\nof the social relations of production reflect and are reflected in\\nchanges in the structure of society as a whole.\\nSomedivisions within the working class, then, stem from\\ndifferences within production . But there are other divisions which\\nareconstructed as much outside as within the workplace. Race and\\ngender are the most obvious examples. In recent decades the\\n\\'economically active\\'workforce inBritainhas been greatly\\nextended to include large numbers of blacks and married women.\\nTheincorporation of such new groups into the paid workforce is\\noften enabled by the kinds of technological changes mentioned\\nabove - not necessarily because less-demanding jobsare created\\nwhich the newworkers can perform (as is often asserted), but often\\nsimply because the very decomposition andreorganisation of the\\nwork process enables the recruitment of a social group previously\\nexcluded, perhaps on ideological grounds. Theincorporation of\\nsuch new groups is often bound up with continuing antagonisms\\nanddemarcations within the division of labour- sexismand racism\\nare powerful divides within the working class.\\n***\\nIn mostcapitalist societies there are also classes otherthan capital\\nandlabour. Land ownership may be the basis for a distinct class,\\nfor instance; as can self-employment. Itis thelatter, because ofits\\ndirect relation to production, which immediately concerns us here.\\nBecause self-employment does not involve the exploitation of wage\\nlabourit is not strictly a capitalist form; it is involved in no\\nrelations, in the immediate production process, with labour. This\\nis the petty bourgeoisie of Figure 2 .1, defined as having economic\\nownership and possession of the physical means of production, but\\nas having no controlover the labourof others (since no labouris\\nemployed). Thereare many people in industrialised capitalist\\nsocieties who are self-employed simply in the sense that that\\nhappens to be the way their wages are paid. Itmay simply be a\\nway of avoiding employer obligations or taxes. The \\'lump\\'in the\\nconstruction industry is the most obvious example in the United\\nKingdom; sub-contracted homeworking isanother. Byself-employ\\xad\\nment we mean here to refer to real controlover aproduction Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 35\\nprocess.Itis real social relations ratherthanlegal forms which\\ngivemeaning to thegroupscharacterised byparticular labels.Inthis\\nstrictersense,self-employment, as aformofproduction, is a pre\\xad\\ncapitalist inheritance, but itscontinued reproduction, the factthat\\nnewareasofself-employment continue to growandflourish, means\\nthatin thiscategory, too, there is significant differentiation. Itis a\\nkindofdifferentiation which, in the UnitedKingdom , closely\\nparallels thatwithin small firms. One element iswhatmight be\\ncalled the classic traditional pettybourgeoisie. Itis typified by the\\nshopkeeper, anclementofthe social structure which is genuinely\\npre-capitalist in the sense thatitretainsafoothold in thosepartsof\\ntheeconomy wherecapitalist firms have not yet fully takenover.\\nForprecisely this reasonit is, inindustrialised capitalist societies, a\\ngrouptypically (though by nomeansalways) on the decline - the\\ncornershopunderthreatfrom the supermarket, self-employment\\npushedout bycompetition fromcapitalemploying wage-labour.In\\ncontrast, there are partsoftheeconomy in which self-employment is\\nexpanding , and where it is not, therefore, as a type, underthreat.\\nThe new professional andbusiness-service sectorsare anexample.\\nDecline and expansion are not the only differences between these\\nelements withinthecategory ofself-employment. Theirsocial\\ncharacteristics are also markedly different. Theself-employed in\\ntheprofessions andsimilarareastend to see theirjobsashigh-status\\nones.They are usually graduates, and in social terms may have little\\nincommon with the shopkeepers whosecompany , informalclass\\nterms, they are sometimes said to keep.\\nMoreover , within any actualcapitalist society there are also\\ngroups,oftenquitesubstantial , which do not fit neatlyandclearly\\ninto any of these unambiguous classdefinitions. Thecriteriaof\\ndefinition ofeachofthese three classes are neitherall-or-nothing\\ncharacteristics norstaticdescriptions. Classes are a product of\\nhistoryandofsocialconflictas well as being constituent ofthem.\\nTheirdefinitions are based on functions whose social organisation\\nchanges over time. Between classes, therefore, aredimensions of\\ntension representing realprocesses ofchangewithincapitalist\\nsociety.Takethe division between bourgeoisie andworking class.\\nTheformeris defined as having botheconomic ownership and\\npossession ofthe means ofproduction (i.e.controlbothover what\\nisproduced andover how it is produced), thelatterashaving\\nneither. Yet capitalist development has been characterised bothby a\\nseparation ofeconomic ownership frompossession (mirrored ,along 36SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwith the disjunction oflegalownership and real economic owner\\xad\\nship, in the debateon\\'theseparation ofownership fromcontrol\\')\\nand by the development ofcomplex hierarchies withineach.\\nRelations ofpossession concern theorganisation ofthecapitalist\\nproduction process. They involve controlbothover the physical\\nmeansofproduction and over labour. On the former, there have\\ndeveloped hierarchies ofmanagement from top managers control\\xad\\nling theproductive apparatus ofa wholecompany , tofunctionaries\\nat thebottomof the pile. On the latterthere have developed\\nhierarchies ofsupervision , from upper management to the fore\\xad\\nperson on the shop floor. With economic ownership a similar\\nhierarchy maystretchfrom the top executives who have full control\\nof the overall investment andaccumulation process (often as wellas\\nconsiderable legalownership), throughmanagers who have control\\noverinvestment only inindividual plantsorparticular functional\\ndivisions, to those lowest levels ofmanagement which mainly\\nadminister the decisions ofothers.Puttingall thistogether, there\\nis aspectrum within these \\'contradictory locations \\', asWrightcalls\\nthem,\" from top management with some, but not full, economic\\nownership alongside full participation inrelations of possession\\nthroughto, say, someone supervising justoneproduction line, and\\nhaving,therefore, noeconomic ownership , little if any controlover\\nthe physical apparatus ofproduction , and limited controlover\\notheremployees. Thereis inthatsense a spectrum from the\\nbourgeoisie (thepersonnel ofcapital)to theworking class.\\nThedimension betweenproletariat and petty bourgeoisie reflects\\nthe long process ofremovalofimmediate jobcontrolfrom direct\\nproducers. Itrelates to such processes as deskilling. There are a\\nnumberofelements here. There are skilled manualandcraftjobs\\nwhere the individual workerretains more flexibility in terms ofhow\\nthejobis done and even over exactly what is produced .Thereare\\nalsothosenewgroupsofemployees -scientists ,high-level\\ntechnicians and the like - whose jobsarecreatedincounterposition\\nto the deskilling ofothers, in the larger process oftheseparation of\\nconception from execution. These jobs,too,containelements of\\nindividual jobcontrol orautonomy .Wright(1978) gives the\\nexamples ofresearchers in laboratories , and university academics.\\nNeitherofthesejobsoften involves much controloverother\\npeople\\'s labour,yet each involves a reasonable degreeofcontrol\\nover the conditions andorganisation ofwork. Like self-employ\\xad\\nment, this is not simply a h istorically-residual category on a one- Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 37\\nwaypathtoelimination; it isconstantly beingaddedto by new and\\nratherdifferent elements.\\nFinally, the dimension between bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoi\\xad\\nsie. Both groups,ateitherendofthespectrum, have full economic\\nownership, andcontrolover the relations ofpossession .What\\ndistinguishes them is their relationto theexploitation oflabourand\\nthereby to accumulation. Thepetty-bourgeois ownerwill beboth\\nmoreinvolved indirectproduction andlessinvolved in the\\nemployment ofothersand in real accumulation, thanis the fully\\ncapitalist employer. But once again, there is a spectrum, reflecting\\nboththedying-out ofself-employment inindustries where fully\\ncapitalist relations ofproduction areestablished and thecontinual\\nregrowth ofself-employment inotherpartsoftheeconomy .\\nTheframework ,therefore, represents not astatictypology, ready\\nto be fitted on to a piece of the real world, but a set ofsocial\\nprocesses within which there is constant tensionand behind which\\nlie theconflicts ofacapitalist society. Thesedimensions of\\ncontradictory classlocations relatenotjustto the\\'aspatial\\'\\ndevelopment of the social relations ofacapitalist society, but also\\nto new forms ofspatialorganisation within such a society.\\nAt a very immediate level, each of these dimensions is reflected in\\ndebatesalreadygoing on, although in verydifferent terms,about\\nthegeographical organisation ofproduction. On thedimension of\\nrelations between bourgeoisie andproletariat lies the whole\\nspectrum ofmanagerial stratawhich has been the focus ofso\\nmuchoftheattention ofthebehavioural schoolofindustrial\\nlocation. Different kindsofspatialorganisation ofmanagement\\nhave been voluminously described. Study afterstudyhasexamined\\ntheimplications forlonger-termlocalgrowthofbranch-plant\\ndomination ofregional economies .Whatbothissues are really\\nconcerned with is the geographical organisation ofthedeveloping\\nsocialrelations ofproduction. Whatis at issue, andwhatis the key\\ntoformulating suchquestions systematically, is thespatial organi\\xad\\nsationofeconomic ownership and therelations ofpossession. The\\nempirical information gained in behavioural studiesofmanagement\\nstructure aboutactivities and personnel can bereconceptualised in\\ntermsofthefunction ofthe activities within the social relations of\\nproduction and the place ofthepersonnel within the wider social\\xad\\nclassstructure . Likewise, the dimension from pettybourgeoisie to\\nproletariat relates to aspects ofdeskilling and the dichotomisation\\nofthelabourforce. The much-studied RandDworkerswith their 38SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhighly-concentrated geographical distribution are also to he found\\nalongthisdimension .Note,too, apointwhich will become\\nimportant later:thatthere are different sourcesofthe \\'white-collar\\nmiddle class\\', some havingamanagerial role,othersajob,such as\\nresearch, with a high degree ofautonomy, andthatthesedifferent\\nfunctions imply also ratherdifferent classlocations. Finally,along\\nthedimension between pettybourgeoisie andbourgeoisie lie all the\\ndifferent kindsofsmall firms, differentiated bynumberofemploy\\xad\\nees, byattitudetoexpansion and by social character.\\n* **\\nTheargument here,then, isthatWright\\'s framework can be\\nextended . Both the broadrelations between classes and the very\\nconsiderable differences within them are fundamental inunder\\xad\\nstanding locational change, bothits causes and its wider effects.\\nBothwhatare called \\'interregional relations\\' andgeographical\\ndifferences in type ofemployment are in large partthespatial\\nexpression oftherelations ofproduction and the divisions oflabour\\nwithin society. Notonly is there a relationbetween developments\\nwithin the social relations ofproduction on the one handand social\\nstructure on theother,butthatrelationoccurs over space. The\\nchanging spatialorganisation oftherelationsofproduction and the\\ndivisionoflabouris a basis for understanding changing spatial\\npatterns ofemployment and thegeography ofsocial class. And the\\nchanging organisation offunctions within those evolving relations\\nofproduction is a basis for understanding changesin\\'interregional\\nrelations\\'. All this will be taken up in Chapter 3.\\nBut - once again - the framework inFigure2.1isonly a\\nframework .Itis a way intotheanalysis ofrealhistorical\\ndiversity. Quitewhat the characteristics andcomposition ofclasses\\nwill be in any particular country, and how thatwill berelatedto\\ngeographical patternsandstructures is anempirical question. What\\nmattersis not to superimpose a formal framework on the \\'real\\nworld\\'and expect the lattertoconform, or to be simply under\\xad\\nstandable when read throughanabstract and pre-given taxonomy .\\nThepointofaframework is toprovideanapproach to analysis of\\nthe real world, not to substitute for it. The remainder ofthis\\nchapter, and the next, develop theframework further, and in the\\nsecondpartofthebooktheapproach is used to investigate recent\\nchanges in therelation between social and spatialstructure in\\nBritain. Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 39\\nElaborations\\nAndmatters, anyway, arenotso simple. It is notpossible to\\nunderstand the wider characteristics ofsocialstructure simply by\\nexamining developments withinproduction. Forone thing, there\\nare many groupsin society which cannotbe\\'placed\\' socially in\\ntermsoftheir own immediate roles in the relations ofproduction.\\nMoresignificantly from the pointofviewoftheargument here,\\nthere is no determinate, one-way relationbetween a function within\\ntherelations ofproduction and the social groupwhichperforms it.\\nWhatwe have lookedat so far is really places andfunctions . But\\n\\'who\\'does aparticular jobis notdetermined by therelations of\\nproduction themselves, nor by\\'technology\\', butbyparticular\\nconjunctions ofthe economics oflabourmarkets andofsocial\\ntradition. Thereisevidence thatthestatusandtrendiness of some of\\nthe newly-emerging jobs\\'incomputers \\' is a result more ofthe fact\\nthat,in thepresentstateofthelabourmarket,graduates are usually\\nemployed to fill them, thanofany real requirements ofthe tasks\\nthemselves. Ideologies of race and gendercriss-cross thelabour\\nmarket,defining which groupscan do which jobs. How can one\\nsquaretheconstant, and usually unexamined, \\'argument\\' that\\'the\\nwork got lighter so enabling women to be employed\\' with the fact\\nthatin theThirdWorld it is women who do mostofthe heavy\\nlabour?Closed shops and demarcation rules have similareffects \\xad\\nconveyancing in house purchase canhardlybe said to requireskilled\\nworkers, but it is solicitors, at high fees, who do it.\\nTheconverse is alsotrue. The social statusofagroupof\\nemployees is not simply determined by the real contentofthejob\\ntheyarehiredto do.Allen(1977)writesof\\'ideologically\\ndetermined labourmarkets\\' and argues that\\'Thereis no task in\\nthe whole process of production , exchange and distribution which is\\nnotrankedaccording to its usefulness to the system in spite ofand\\noftencontrary to its own objective skill qualities\\' (p. 67). And\\ndifferences in ideological statusspill over into all aspects ofthejob,\\nandtherefore beyond. \\'Workers in highstatusjobstend to have\\nhigherearnings, shorterand more congenially-distributed working\\nhours,betterworking conditions , longerholidays and more social\\namenities in general than those in jobsrankedbelowthem\\'(p. 67).\\nNordoes the social definition ofajobas\\'skilled\\' necessarily have\\nmuch to do with the real contentof thelabourprocess. There\\ncertainly are real differences between different jobsin termsofthe 40SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nlevel of skill required. But an analysis, for instance, of tradeunion\\nagreements or the Census of Production skillcategories would not\\nnecessarily relate to these attributes. Whether or not a particular\\njobis classified as skilled can be as much a result oforganisational\\nstrength,bargaining power and ideology as ofthenatureofthe task\\nitself. The Coventry carindustry in the 1920s provides a good\\nexample. The ratioofskilled to semi-skilled workerswas far higher\\ntherethanin the car industry in the rest of England. This was not\\ndue to a difference in the production process, but to the fact that\\nmany semi-skilled workers (defined in terms oftheamountof\\ntraining needed for the jobthey were doing) managed to gain\\nskilledstatusinCoventry. \\'Tobe classified as skilled in Coventry\\'s\\ncarindustry came simply to distinguish thoseworkers who were\\nbeing paid the district skilled rate. Increasingly workers achieved\\nthis rate on account of their individual bargaining powerrather\\nthantheirskills\\'(Friedman, 1977,p.204). Themostfamous\\nexampleofthis kind ofbasis for skill-categorisation was thebattle\\nover\\'dilution\\' in theengineering industries in Britain in wartime. It\\nwas abattlecaused by the ease with which supposedly unskilled\\nworkers, particularly women, were able to take over the jobsof\\nsupposedly skilled male workers. Thedesignation as skilled, and\\nindeed the ability to hangon tothatdesignation in spiteofdilution,\\nwas clearly in large measure a resultofhistorical organisational and\\ninstitutional factors. Rubery (1978) concludes that\\'workers are\\nthus \\'skilled\\' and \\'unskilled\\' according towhether or notentryto\\ntheirorganisation isdeliberately restricted, and not in the first place\\naccording to thenatureoftheoccupation itself(p. 31). The very\\nfactthata job is done by women, whatever itscontent, is likely to\\nlower its status.Subordinate ethnicgroupsoften face the same\\nphenomenon. Here, then, the different lines ofargument come\\ntogether. Technology, the physical natureoftheproduction process\\nand the real contentoftasks are important influences on the nature\\noflabour-demand , on who does what joband on the social status\\naccorded to it, but they are not the whole explanation.\\nThiskindofconsideration can beimportant inlocational\\nanalysis. As was said earlier, changes in the labourprocess may\\nbeintroduced bymanagement for a variety ofreasons,amongthem\\nbeingattempts to increase controlover the production process and\\nto reduce its cost in money terms. The two are not the same. \\'Real\\ndeskilling\\' is likely to lead to both,to apotential increase in control\\n(in so far as this is a productofthelabourprocess itself) and to a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 41\\nreduction in wage costs. The fact thatit may not reduce costs\\nimmediately will be due to the ability ofestablished groupsof\\nworkers tohangon to their status. And one way capitalhasof\\nretaliating tothatkindofdefence of living standards on thepartof\\nworkers is simply to shift locationally, beyondthegeographical\\nboundsoftheworkerswith whom they are negotiating .Conversely,\\na sufficient degree ofalteration in thelabourprocess, even when it\\ninvolves no \\'real\\'deskilling at all, may enablethedowngrading ofa\\njobin formal, and therefore cost terms. A crucialelement in the\\nability to do this may well be a change in the workforce, from an\\nestablished one which had won the accreditation \\'skilled\\', to a new\\none with no negotiating basis inrelationto thisemployment. It is\\nsimply a move from a stronger (because established) to aweaker\\npartofthelabourmarket.And in turn an important element in\\nmakingthis shift may be locational change. This does not mean\\nthatthere are no differences in skill, no processes of deskilling. It\\ndoes mean, however, thatthe formal, official categories may refer\\nless to such attributes thantostrength, statusand wages, and that\\nto detect real changes in jobcontentthelabourprocess must be\\nexamined directly.Muchhas been made in recentyears, for\\ninstance, ofthe deskilling which seems to have enabledperipher\\xad\\nalisation (bothintra-and internationally) ofunitsofproduction.\\nCertainly in many cases these locational shiftswerepossible because\\nofachangein theproduction process which meantthata less\\nskilledlabourforce could be employed. In othercases,though, the\\nchange in production process freed capitalfromdependence on a\\ngroupofworkers who did the jobas a result oftradition rather\\nthan specific skill, thereby enabling achangeofworkforce and\\nlocation, eventhoughnoactualdeskilling was involved. The two\\nlines ofdistinction , between skill in relationtojobcontentand the\\nsocial labelling of skill, do not coincide. But bothare real. They\\nbothmarkimportant dimensions ofdifferentiation withinthe\\nworkforce . Similarly, to say thatanindustry islookingforcheap,\\nunskilled, female labouris an immensely loadedstatement. That\\n\\'demand\\' cannotbe taken to be simply a reflection of technology .\\nNor,therefore, can\\'locationfactors\\'be seen as simply the reflection\\nof therequirements ofthelabourprocess.Labourprocess is not in\\nthat sense determinant oflocation. In theseandmanyotherways,\\nthe link between production relations, socialstructure andlocation\\nis theproductof wider social factors as wellas ofthecharacteristics\\nof thejobitself.Itis notjusta one-way influence; the relative 42SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nweaknesses and strengths ofdifferent groupsin theworkforce can\\naffect the way the production process isevolved, to take advantage\\nofthe one and to avoid the other. To say, then, thatindustrial\\nlocationispartofwider social relations does not justmeanthatit is\\nset in a larger context. The wider social relations ofsociety also\\ninfluence the internalstructure ofproduction itself. Once again, the\\nideological and the economic are integral to the construction of\\neach other.\\nThis is still to talk in terms ofrelations ofproduction ,ofthe\\nfunctions within them, and of the groupswhichperform those\\nfunctions . Because a main theme ofthisbookarguesthatone of the\\nkeys to understanding thegeography ofemployment is the\\ngeography oftherelations ofproduction, this level will be an\\nimportant focus of attention . Butthatlevel of analysis is not\\nsufficient to define \\'classes\\' in any more full-blooded sense. As Hall\\n(1977)putsit,production relations indicate the sites ofclass\\nrelations in the economic structure, but those sites do not designate\\nwhole classes as integral, empirical groupsof men and women. The\\nfactthatpeople occupy similar places in the relations ofproduction\\ndoes not in itself imply any otherempirical level ofcoherence, still\\nless any kind ofnecessary political unity aboutpre-given common\\ninterests. Wright talks ofclasscapacities, the social relations within\\naclasswhichdetermine howinternally coherent it is. He\\ndistinguishes between structural capacities (thoseinternal links\\ngenerated bythedevelopments ofacapitalist society) and\\norganisational capacities (thoselinks which are a product of\\nconscious organisation). Skilled and unskilled workers, blacks and\\nwhites,whatever theirapparent common fundamental interests, are\\nfrequently pittedagainsteachotherin the immediacy of day-to-day\\nlife,and it isin actualstrugglethatpolitical subjects are constituted .\\nAllofwhich means, first, that\\'wholeclasses\\' are rarely actual\\npolitical subjects and, second, thatit is most frequently non-class\\nsubjects - blacks, women, taxpayers - who occupy the front ofthe\\npolitical stage.\\nWe have, therefore , come a long way from the classic conception\\nofindustrial location theory,in which an entrepreneur or a\\nmanager staresout at a \\'spatial surface\\' and makes a \\'location\\ndecision\\' in acontextdivorced from historyand social relations.\\nThe\\'industrial location decision\\' isjustonemoment in a much\\nwidereconomic, ideological and political field. But we have also\\ncome a long way from thatconception ofthe world which envisages Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 43\\na simple opposition betweencapitalandlabourin acontextwhere\\nthecategories and theimmanent tendencies ofthecapitalist mode\\nofproduction substitute for analysis ofrealhistory.\\nReflections\\nThreeelements ofthisjourneyare ofparticular importance for the\\nanalysis here.\\nThe first concerns therelationship between politics and ideology,\\nandthatrealm very generally and vaguely referred to as \\'the social\\',\\non the one hand, and\\'theeconomic\\' on theother.We have seen\\nthatpolitics and ideology are not to be interpreted as simple\\nreflections ofthe economic; thatwas clear in the discussion of\\nclass, for instance. But perhapsmoreimportant here, because the\\nfocusofthis book is, in the end, on the economic, is the obverse\\nimplication -thatpolitics and ideology are themselves important in\\ntheconstruction of theeconomic. Questions of who does which\\njobs,theproblem ofthedefinition ofskill, the identification of\\ndifferent kindsofcapital, all exemplify the fact thattheeconomic\\naspectsofsociety are themselves social constructions ,thoroughly\\nimbued with politics andideological tradition. Exactly parallel\\npointsare reflected at a wider level. Statepoliciescannotsimply\\nbeinterpreted in terms of\\'thedemands oftheeconomy\\'. Itis no\\nargument to saythat\\'accumulation required theimplementation of\\nregional policy\\',for instance. Forone thing, as we have seen, the\\nprocess is more complex thanthatanyway. Therearefrequently\\nhighlysignificant divisions andconflicts within\\'capital\\' and\\ntherefore in therequirements ofaccumulation .Ithastherefore to\\nbeanalysed as to how the ruling requirement isestablished as\\ngeneral.Moreimportantly, theeconomic development ofsociety is\\nitself subject to political determination. The stimuli and pressures of\\ninternational capitalism do not arrive raw at the factorygate. The\\norganisation ofthenational economy is itself an objectofpolitical\\nstruggle; different sectionsofthe ruling class seek to impose their\\nown, very different, political rationalities upon it. These rational\\xad\\nities are truly political; they cannotsimply be analysed as the\\nproductoftherequirements oftheeconomy. \\'Thismeansthatthe\\neconomy , like allotherspheresofsociety, is the terrainofa political\\nstruggle, and thatits \"laws ofmotion\" are not governed by a simple\\nlogic, but by the hegemonic articulation existing in a given society\\'\\n(LaclauandMouffe, 1981,p. 22). In Britain, for example, there is a 44 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nworldofdifference between the economic and social logic of\\ndifferent partsoftheStateandbetween different political\\nelements. Gamble (1981) has analysed some ofthesecontrasting\\npositions and their effects, pointing for instance to thatimportant,\\nand long dominant, strandwithin the British Conservative Partyfor\\nwhich the maintenance ofsocial power and relatively stable class\\nrelations has been of far greaterimportance thananyparticular\\n\\'bourgeois\\' economic ideology, such as thatof the free play of\\nmarketforces. There have been many times when the maintenance\\nofthehistorical termsofclass rule have not been simply consistent\\nwith \\'the interests of the British economy\\' .Butifthatis the case\\nthen, as Laclau and Mouffe argue, the political must be a primary\\ndefiningcharacteristic ofanyparticular conjuncture . Ifthatalso is\\nthe case then it must be as a function ofthatpolitics, set- obviously\\n- within the wider constraints ofeconomic conditions but not\\nsimplyrelaying themunmodified , and as a function ofthe\\nconstruction ofthatparticular political hegemony, thatthe role\\nandrationale of, forinstance, regional policy, must be interpreted.\\nThis does not mean, either, thatthe analysis is simply reversed \\xad\\nthat\\'thepolitical\\' level rules, un trammelled byotherconsidera\\xad\\ntions.Forpoliticalrationalities andinterpretations arerationalities\\naboutandinterpretations ofthe objective circumstances of the time,\\nchiefamongthem the requirements ofcapitalist production .\\n* * *The second element ofimportance isthatempirical analysis does\\nnot consist ofreferences to the \\'laws\\' ofcapitalist development, nor\\nisexplanation adequately established by a gesture in the direction of\\nsome \\'immanent tendency\\'. Forthis reason too, it is not possible to\\nexplaintheactionsofanindividual company ormanagement\\nsimply by referring to therequirements ofaccumulation . The\\nresponse of capitalto suchrequirements will depend on its own\\nsocialcharacteristics , the kinds ofcalculation which it makes, the\\nkindofworkforce with which it is faced and its actions,and on the\\ntermsofthebattlebetween them. If the management ofGEC,\\nBritish Steel or British Leyland engage in long struggles with the\\nworkforce over changes in the labourprocess and location, and if\\nthose changes broadlycoincide with the longer run ofdevelopments\\nundercapitalism, then it is important tounderstand that.Butit is\\nnone the lessinsufficient to refer to those tendencies in explanation .\\nWhat,then, of those cases where the long-run tendencies do not\\n\\'showup in the real world\\'?The same pointsapply to the analysis of Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 45\\nthespatialdevelopment ofcapitalist societies as a whole. Again\\nthere are no inexorable trendswhich can be broughtdownoffthe\\nshelf inexplanation when the results of empirical analysisappearto\\nconform with the theory.\\nThe most obviousexample withingeographical analysis has been\\ntheassertion of a necessary tendency to increasing spatialconcen\\xad\\ntration. Such a position has anapparent radicalism ,andis clearly\\noftenstimulated by adesiretocounter theconclusions of\\nequilibration atequality which emerge from neoclassical theory.\\nMarx himself is sometimes claimed to have identified aninevitable\\ntendency undercapitalism towards spatialconcentration, and\\ncertainly there are quotations which can be read to this effect.\\nThemostobvious sourceofsuchevidence isprobably the\\ndiscussion oftheturnover ofcapital,andparticularly ofthe time\\nofcirculation, this having evident relevance to the geographical\\ndimension. But it would be unfairto deduce from such quotations\\nthatMarxhad adeveloped position thatthedominant tendency\\nwithin the geographical development ofthecapitalist modeof\\nproduction wasthattowardscentralisation andinequality .Whathe\\ndid was to pointto anumberofdifferent - andcontradictory \\xad\\nforces to which the development ofcapitalism might give rise.\\nSomeattempts have been made morerecently, however, to\\nproduce a moresystematic analysis. While numerous writers refer\\nto\\'increasing spatialconcentration undercapitalism \\', fewargue the\\ncase in detail. The most thorough attemptis in the work ofLapple\\nand van Hoogstraten (Liipple, 1978; Lappleand van Hoogstraten ,\\n1979; and van Hoogstraten, 1979). In their variouspapers, Liipple\\nand van Hoogstraten argue the case for the existence within the\\ncapitalist modeofproduction of adominant tendency towards\\nincreasing geographical concentration. Theirargument has a\\nnumber ofstrands. Theypostulate that increases in the social\\nproductivity oflabourrequire,undercapitalism, acorresponding\\nexpansion in the scale ofproduction. Itisarguedthatany\\nlocational decision in any unit of production within any particular\\nsectorwill be subject to two sets ofinfluences - \\'natural\\' conditions\\n(such as the availability of rawmaterials , the existence of\\'natural\\'\\ntransport routes)and\\'social\\'conditions (such as the natureofthe\\nlabourforce, accessibility to othersectors).Itis then suggested that\\nthe direct influence of \\'natural\\' conditions mustdiminish over time\\ninrelationtothatofsocialconditions , andfurtherthat that shift in\\nbalance implies an increasing degree ofgeographical concentration. 46 Spatial Divisions ojLabour\\nBut must this changeofemphasis between different typesof\\n\\'locationfactors\\'produce an increasing degree ofspatialconcen\\xad\\ntration? Theauthors arguethattwothings,theincreasing\\nemancipation from a directdependence on\\'natural\\' location\\nfactors, and the development ofthe division oflabourboth work\\ntowardssuchconcentration ;thatthe reduced importance ofnatural\\nfactors entails a corresponding reduction in the tendency ofunitsof\\nproduction to disperse in response to their differing dependencies\\non such factors; and thatthe increasing division oflabourentails\\nalso itsopposite, the need for every individual plantto be inspatial\\ncontactwith the rest ofthe social collective labourer.\\'Alongwith\\ntheincreasing socialisation ofproduction theproductivity ofsocial\\nlabourbecomes even more strongly dependent on the possibilities\\nofthe systematic combinat ion in space ofthedifferent stagesof\\nproduction\\'(Lapple andvanHoogstraten, 1979, p. 10). The\\nmechanisms beingpointedto here are certainly real. The increasing\\ndivisionoflabourisatvariance with the(corresponding) increase in\\nthe need for contactbetween the different partsoftotallabour.But\\ndoes this meanthatproduction will be increasingly spatially\\nconcentrated? The conflict is between anarchy and the need for\\nsocialisation ,whichisnotnecessarily thesameasbetween\\ndispersion andconcentration .Certainly the need for contactwill\\nprovidea pull in thatdirection, butotherfactorswill also be\\noperative . Thegrowthin theproductivity oflabourwill also\\nincrease the ease ofcrossing space (the annihilation ofspace by\\ntime); some social factors, such as costs oflabour, may work in the\\nopposite direction, increasing precisely as a result ofconcentration .\\nClearly, the growing division oflabourwill reinforce the need for\\nsystematic combination andorganisation ofspatialcontacts, but\\nthis does not necessarily imply spatialconcentration .Whathas been\\nunearthed is one influence. Ithas not been established thatit will\\nnecessarily be dominant. Exactly the same reservations apply to the\\nnext stage oftheargument, whichconcerns thetertiarysector. Once\\nagain an important tendency has been highlighted, but what does\\nnot seem to have been satisfactorily established isthatthis is in any\\nsense the dominant tendency.\\nLappleand vanHoogstraten do indeed consider the possibility of\\ncounter-influences, thatis, tendencies towardsthespatialdispersion\\nofproduction. They identify two. The first is thattheincreasing size\\nofindividual capitals, in thecontextoftheincreasing divisionof\\nlabour,enablesthesplitting up ofdifferent functions within the Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 47\\nproduction process, and their separate, anddifferentiated , loca\\xad\\ntional responses. The second is, as already mentioned, thatthe fact\\nof spatial concentration may itself produce negative effects and\\nconsequently a tendency to decentralisation, especially on the part\\nof relativelyweak firms and sectors of production. But, they argue,\\nthese are not the dominant tendencies because ofthe increasing\\nnecessityfor State provision ofthe general conditions ofproduction\\nand ofreproduction . At this point the explanation amounts not so\\nmuch to an argument as to an empirical observation. Indeed, for\\nmany writers the elucidation ofnecessary spatial tendencies under\\ncapitalism hasconsisted ofobservation ofactualempirical\\ntendencies followed by attempts tore-readthem as logically\\nnecessary outcomes of a pure capitalist mode of production. Quite\\napartfrom all the epistemological disadvantages referred to earlier,\\nsuch aprocedure opens itselfup to simple refutation by referenceto\\nempirical examples ofthe opposite tendency. At the time of writing,\\nfor instance, the phenomenon of\\'usines isolees\\' isprobably the\\nmost discussed aspect of the changing geography ofproduction in\\nwestern Europe.\\nFinally, what ismeant, afterall, by spatial centralisation? Clearly\\nmostauthors on thesubjectarereferring notonly to the\\ncentralisation ofcontroloverproduction , but also to the centralisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction itself. But what is meant exactly? How would\\none goaboutevaluating it - by proportions of wage-earners, by\\nwages of wage-earners, by amountof capital investment or some\\nmeasure of production? The responses have been varied, and often\\nambiguous. The implication we draw here is thatcentralisation \\xad\\nand indeed geographical inequality in general - is not to be\\nmeasured on some simple linear dimension of inequality but must\\nrefer more to a structure ofdominant relations between elements of\\nthe economies of different \\'regions\\'. But how does one compare\\nsuchstructures ofdominance to decide whether or not centralisa\\xad\\ntion isincreasing?Indeed, might not such structures vary not just in\\ndegree but also in kind?\\nThe issue is yet more complicated than this. Apartfrom the\\nproblem of the variables on which it is to be measured, what does\\n\\'increasing centralisation\\' mean ingeographical terms? Does it mean\\nthatthoseregionswhich gain the initialadvantage become\\nincreasingly dominant, and the peripheral regions increasingly\\npoor? This patternis what is implied by most versions of the\\n\\'cumulative causation\\' model. Yet how, in thatcase, can clear cases 48SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nofreversal bedealtwith?WhatofBelgium, where once the\\nindustrial mightofthesouthwasdominant but where the main\\ncentresofaccumulation are now in Flanders, with the old industrial\\nareas lying neglected anddepressed?\\nOneofthe main characteristics ofthedeveloping geography of\\ncapitalist societies so far has been precisely the development ofnew\\nareas and the abandonment of old. Even if we acceptthatthe\\nexistence ofproduction in a region does notin itself make that\\nregion a centreofaccumulation , the whole historyofcapitalism\\nindicates thatwhatwe need ISnot some single concept, such as\\n\\'centralisation\\', but a whole range ofconcepts which will allow the\\nanalysisofcomplicated, andchanging, structures ofgeographical\\ninequality . Toreturntoouroriginal theme, even had some general\\nlogicalspatialtendencies of\\'acapitalist modeofproduction\\' been\\nestablished , they would notin themselves be an explanation ofthe\\nenormously complex geographical historyofactualcapitalist\\nsocieties. Whatis needed is an approach which can deal with this\\never-changing complexity.\\n* * *Thethirdelement, and puttingall thistogether, isthatwhat we are\\nconcerned with inempirical analysis is geographical andhistorical\\nspecificity. Indeed,whatlies behind the whole notionofuneven\\ndevelopment is the fact ofhighlydifferentiated anduniqueout\\xad\\ncomes.Thatformofanalysis which combines economism with a\\nsimpleapplication ofdeduced laws has createda divorce within\\ncertainstrandsofMarxism between \\'theory\\' and the analysis of\\nparticular situations .Itis a divorce which parallels thatbetween the\\npatently inapplicable mathematical industrial location theoryand\\nthe collapse into simple description by much ofthebehavioural\\nschoolingeography, and by many concerned with real empirical\\nanalysis. Further, whenattempts are made to use such theoryin\\nempirical analysis then,justas with models offirms and their\\nimperfect realisation in the world, so with laws and actualhistor\\xad\\nicaldevelopments: behaviour is split into two andthe world is\\ndivided between the inexorable a prioriand the purely descriptive\\ndeviation. The models offirmsdeveloped bothin classical industrial\\nlocation theoryandsubsequently in thebehavioural school,both\\ninterpreted the factofspecificity as one of mismatch betweentheory\\nand reality. It was a problem; andbothcoped with it by dividing\\nanalysis, and by implication company behaviour, intotwocomp\\xad\\nletelydifferent parts-thatwhichaccorded with the a priorimodel Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 49\\nandthatwhich was attributed to\\'additional factors\\'derived simply\\nfromobserving anddescribing thisparticular individual case\\n(Massey, 1976). Certain formsofMarxism standindangerof\\nreproducing the same mismatch and the same untenable dichoto\\xad\\nmy.Moreover, \\'precisely because no\"fact\"canrepresent a\\nchallenge to the inexorable courseofhistory,we canaffordto be\\nnegligent with facts. This attitude, paradoxically ,createstwoorders\\nof reality. The first, thatofthe necessary laws ofevolution , which is\\ntheorised in a rigorous fashion, represents thelatentmeaning of\\nhistory. The second, the orderoffacts, in the absence of any\\nperspective which would allow a theoretical analysisofthe con\\xad\\njuncture, amounts to no more than a sum of empirical circum\\xad\\nstances\\'(Laclauand Mouffe, 1981, p. 18).The implications ofsuch\\nanapproach aredeleterious not only to analysis but also to political\\nintervention . On the one handthere is little thatcan bedoneabout\\ntheinexorable. On the otherhand,mechanistic analyses are\\nfollowed by a polities with which they have little connection (see,\\nfor example, Dunford,GeddesandPerrons, 1981).\\'An ever-greater\\nchasm is thus established between the expedients ofday-to-day\\npolitical practice and the aprioristic knowledge ofthe laws of\\nhistory\\'(Laclau and Mouffe, 1981, p. 18). The pointoftheoretical\\nconcepts, andofframeworks such as those elaborated here, is to\\nprovide tools for the analysis ofspecificsituations, analyses on\\nwhichactioncan be based.\\n2.4 The social and the spatial:an impossible dichotomy\\nGeography matters\\nJust as most locational studies have failed to relate geographical\\nchanges to wider social relations, so have most studiesofsocial\\nrelations ignoredgeography .Conceptual work in economics and\\nsociology frequently proceeds as thoughthe world existed on the\\nheadofa pin - as thoughit were distanceless andspatially\\nundifferentiated .Theacademic disciplinary division oflabour\\nbetween \\'substance\\' and\\'space\\' has doneharmtoboth.The\\n\\'substance laws\\' ofeconomics and sociology have been spatially\\nblind, while geography has been periodically thrownintoparoxysms\\nofself-doubt aboutwhetherit had a real object ofstudy,and if so,\\nwhat it was. 50 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nGeography\\'s answers to this conundrum have varied over time.\\nFormuch of its history, a central focus ofhumangeography has\\nbeen \\'the region\\', defined as a distinct area oftheearth\\'ssurface,\\nand the concern ofgeographers was tounderstand theinterrelation\\xad\\nship between different aspects of the naturaland social world, \\'from\\ngeology to politics\\', which went to make up the distinctiveness of\\ndifferent places.The emphasis, then, was on the unique. All this was\\noverthrown in the I960s. As in otherdisciplines, thatdecade\\nbrought with it a new dominance ofavarietyofformsof\\npositivism. There was a search after empirically-generalisable laws\\nandan obsession with the quantitative. Uniqueness was now\\nsomething to benormalised-away, reduced toconformity .In\\nmethod,geography thusbecame indistinguishable fromother\\ndisciplines. Its raison d\\'etre, therefore, had to be defined in terms\\nof its object ofstudy, and geography set itself up as \\'thescience of\\nthespatial\\'. Theapproach to the analysis ofspatialpatternby\\ncorrelation between maps with which we began this chapteris a\\nlingering and low-key empirical inheritance fromgeography\\'s\\ntheoretical self-definition of the sixties. A realm of \\'thespatial\\'\\nwasdemarcated. Spatialdistributions were analysed as the result of\\nspatialprocesses (processes operating overspace but defined\\nwithoutanysubstance referents), there were attempts to identify\\npurely spatial mechanisms (gravity models were much in vogue),\\nthere was a search after\\'spatiallaws\\'.\\nAlong with much else, this came under firein the seventies. It was\\npointedoutthatthere were no such things as \\'purelyspatial\\nprocesses\\'. There were only particular social processes operating\\nover space. Spatialform and spatial distributions , it was argued, are\\nthe result not ofspatial processes (for there are no such things) but\\nofsocial processes. It was at this pointthatmanygeographers went\\noff to learn sociology or economics, or whatever discipline related\\nto thesubstance lawsoftheir bitofthe subject. The introduction of\\nproduction intoindustrial geography was thus a particular instance\\nofthe more general move to introduce social processes into the\\nexplanation ofgeographical form.\\nBut this reaction of the seventies itselfhad problems - the relative\\nimportance of the social and the spatialwas simply reversed; the\\ntwocontinued to beconceptualised asseparate realms.Geographi\\xad\\ncalpatterns were now understood as simply the result ofthe\\ndistribution ofsocial processes over space. Geography was reduced\\ntomapping theoutputofotherdisciplines; \\'space\\'was reduced to a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 51\\npassive surface over which social processes were distributed . The\\nequally dispiriting corollary, of course, was that the social processes\\nthemselvescould continue to beconceptualised inaspatialterms. At\\nthispoint,bothspatialandsubstance disciplines were under\\xad\\nestimating the importance ofgeography.\\nFor geography matters. The fact thatprocesses take place over\\nspace, the facts ofdistance or closeness, of geographical variation\\nbetween areas, of the individual character and meaning of specific\\nplaces and regions - all these are essential to the operation of social\\nprocesses themselves. Just as there are no purely spatialprocesses,\\nneither are there any non-spatial social processes. Nothing much\\nhappens, bar angels dancing, on the head of a pin. The title ofthis\\nsection refers to the frequent separation of the inseparable. Nordo\\nany of these processes operatein anenvironmentally characterless,\\nneutral and undifferentiated world.Geography in the fuller sense\\nimpliesnot only spatial distance but also physical differentiation, of\\nterrain,ofvegetation, ofclimate. Such physical features and\\nvariations areimportant. Their impact, use and meaning will, of\\ncourse, be socially constructed, but that construction isofsome\\xad\\nthing.Timpanaro has written of biology: \\'To maintain thatsince\\nthe \"biological\" is always presented to us as mediated by the\\n\"social\", the\"biological\" is nothing and the \"social\" iseverything,\\nwould ...be idealist sophistry\\' (1974, p. 16).The same applies to\\nthe physical differentiation oftheearth\\'ssurface. There are real\\nenvironmental influences and constraints. But even to conceptualise\\nspace and naturalphysical features in this way (as influence on, or\\nconstraint) is to presuppose a separation, parallel to thatsupposed\\nbetween the social and the spatial more generally, and which is\\nequally untenable - first the social processes, then the influences on\\nthem (Williams, 1978). \\'People and Natureare notseparate: weare\\npartofNatureand tostartin theconventional mannerwith such a\\nseparation followed by a listing ofinteractions would be to\\nprejudice every otheraspect of the exposition\\' (A. Sayer, 1979,\\np. 22).Geography in both its senses, ofdistance/nearness/between\\xad\\nness and of the physical variation of theearth\\'ssurface (the two\\nbeing closely related) is not a constraint on a pre-existing non\\xad\\ngeographical social and economic world. Itisconstitutive ofthat\\nworld.\\nWhat does it mean, then, to say thatgeography, or space, has an\\neffect;thatgeography matters? Clearly it is not to say thatspace\\nalters the processes themselves. Thatwould be to re-posit the 52SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nseparation. Thestatement concerns ouranalysisofthose processes.\\nSubstance laws and analyses ofsocial processes might be different\\nwere they to make integral the fact oftheir necessarily spatial\\ncharacter. Itiscertainly invalid for geographers to seek to define\\nabstractly spatialprocesses withoutreference to substantive con\\xad\\ntent. But it is equally invalid for those in substance disciplines to\\nignore the fact thattherelations they study take place over space\\nand in a geographically-differentiated world.\\'\\n***\\nWhen we take seriously the fact thatthe social processes involved in\\nthedevelopment ofcapitalist relations ofproduction take place \\'in a\\ngeographical world\\',ouranalysisofthem changes. Takea few\\nexamples.\\nProduction change (the development of the forces of production,\\nchanges in the labourprocess, etc.) and locational change may often\\nbealternative ways in which capital can achieve the same ends. The\\nfactofspatialvariation in thelabourforce may give management\\ngreaterflexibility in decisions aboutproduction. If aproduction\\nprocess is potentially mobile it may be easier to move to an area of\\nlow wages thantointroduce, through investment in technical\\nchange, ashiftin thenatureofthelabourprocess.Either\\nstrategy, production change or location change, can be used to\\nachieve the same result - a lowering oflabourcosts. This is a\\nrelation (in this case a choice) between production changeand\\ngeographical changewhich presents itself at a particular moment.It\\nis more likely to changethe speed ratherthan the overall direction\\nofmajortendencies. But it is not justa localised or minoreffect.\\nWhatwould have happened to thedevelopment ofthelabour\\nprocess in clothing, in textiles, in electronics assembly, over the last\\ntwenty years had multinational capitalnot found the desperately\\ncheaplabourreservesoftheThirdWorld?Noris itjusta caseof\\ntheavailability of cheap labourslowing down the necessity for\\nautomation orotherformsoftechnological change. The ability to\\nkeep processes manual, asopposed toautomated, can speed up\\ntechnological innovation in theproduct. Froebel, Heinrichs and\\nKreye (1980) found examples ofthis in their study ofthe new\\ninternational division oflabour. TheyquotetheUnitedStates\\nTariffCommission: \\'Manufacturers statethatsuch rapid changes in\\nthemarketdiscourage economical automation ofproduct lines;\\nautomation would tend (1) to prevent productinnovation because Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 53\\noftheinvestment required, and (2) slow the advance oftechnology\\nvital to maintaining theircompetitive position withregardto\\nimports\\' (quotedon p. 335). It is not justthatproduction shapes\\ngeography; the historically-evolved spatialconfiguration (boththe\\nfact of spatial differentiation and itsparticular nature)has its\\ninfluence on the course taken by accumulation itself.\\nSo the pace, certainly, of changes in the labourprocess will be\\ninfluenced by the kind oflabouravailable, and the variation in it.\\nAnd much ofthisvariability will bespatially organised .Indeed,\\nspatialseparation may be a condition ofthevariation itself.To take\\none obvious, simple example: the fact ofspatialseparation is often\\nanimportant element in the preservation ofparticular, local,\\nconditions ofproduction - low wages, loyalty to the company\\nand aconcomitant lackofmilitancy may be easier for a company to\\nensure in an isolated area where there is a degree oflocalspatial\\nmonopoly over the labourforce. And more generally distance, as\\nwe shall see, has been a great divider oftheworking class, an\\nimportant condition for theperpetuation ofdifferences.\\nFurther,whetheror not the adoption ofaparticular production\\ntechnique and its constituent labourprocesses is accompanied by\\nspatialseparation ofdifferent stagesofproduction will depend on\\nwhetheror not there are spatially-differentiated labourmarkets, or\\nspatialdifferentiation ofsome sort. And, in turn,thatspatial\\nresponse itself may influence the internalorganisation ofthe finn.\\nParticular formsoforganisation oftechnology maybeadopted to\\nenableadvantage to be taken ofparticular geographical patterns.\\nThe fact thatcompanies becomemultilocational (still more, multi\\xad\\nnational) may be the impetus for thedevelopment ofparticular\\nformsofmanagement hierarchies, particular subdivisions ofthe\\nrelations of economic ownership and possession. Different ways of\\nbreaking down the production process, to take advantage of\\nspecific forms of spatialvariation, may inturnstimulate different\\nways ofdisaggregating therelations ofownership and possession,\\nand therefore give rise to different kindsofmanagerial social\\ngroups.Itis notjustthatthegrowthofthemultilocational\\ncompany means the distribution ofthemanagement hierarchy\\nand theassociated relations ofproduction over space but thatthe\\nfact and form ofspatialdistribution may itself influence how those\\nhierarchies and relations develop. In an early and important work,\\nStephen Hymer (1972) pointedouthow inmultilocational compa\\xad\\nnies different functions of management (i.e. within the overall 54SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nrelations of production) weredistributed in hierarchical fashion\\nbetween different geographical places. Itis interesting to reflect on\\nthis, not justfor its implications for uneven development over\\nspace, but also for whetherthe need to devise some form ofspatial\\nstructure itself influenced the development of the division oflabour\\nwithin managerial functions.\\nHistorically, ofcourse, the whole process is a circular one.\\nDistributions of class relations and different social groups over\\nspace are in partaproduct of these processes and operateas\\nlocation factors in subsequent periods of investment. Reserves of\\nlabour,for instance, are the productofsocial relations; they don\\'t\\njusthappen. And such local variations in class and social structure\\ncan intumhave significant effects on location.\\nThis is to concentrate on what happens to the analysis of\\nspecified processes when we recognise their necessarily geographi\\xad\\ncalcharacter. There may also be categories and processes the\\noperation ofwhichcannotbeunderstood without recognising\\ntheir internal spatial structuring. Thenational rate of growth of\\nwages may be set by the regionwherelabourisstrongest\\n(something whichhappened inBritainin the fifties) - what\\neconomists, when they look spatially below the national level,\\nmight explain by geographical rigidities. An assessment of the\\nsupply of and demand forlabourat thenational level, or of its\\nnational-level strength, would not be able to isolate the process at\\nwork.Not,it should be repeated, thatspace, or geographical\\nvariation, has any necessary consequences in andofitself\\xad\\nworkers in the region with the highest level of economic activity\\ncould have been constantly undermined byan influx of unemployed\\nlabourfrom elsewhere (which did happen,as we have seen, some\\ndecades earlier). Itis notthataparticular form of spatial variation\\nwillhave a particular outcome, itselfproduce a necessaryeffect. But\\nthe factofspatialvariation willdemand some social response. It is\\nnot\\'space\\'itself which accounts for the impact on the national\\neconomy but social and economic processes operating spatially.The\\nfactofregional inequality and differentiation can either help or\\nhinder the national rateofaccumulation, and can beaprofound\\ninfluence on State policy towards the economy.\\nItis not, then, justaquestion ofmapping social relations\\n(economic, sociological or whatever) on tospace. The fact that\\nthose relations occur over space matters. Itis notjustthat\\'space is\\nsociallyconstructed \\' - a fact with which geographers have for a Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 55\\nwhile been coming to terms - butthatsocialprocesses are\\nconstructed over space.\\nThinking back to earlier arguments, partofthe necessity for the\\nspecificity ofempirical analyses results from geographical variation\\nin theoperation ofeconomic and social processes and from the\\nparticular localcombinations and local developments ofthose\\nprocesses which go to make up the uniqueness ofplace.\\nSo far, wehave givenjust a fewexamples to illustrate the fact and\\nthe variety of the influences of\\'thegeographical\\' . But the subject\\ncan beapproached more systematically. Quite centrally, location\\nandgeographical mobility are key factors in the conflict between\\nlabourand capital within production. The simple fact of distance,\\nof spatial separation, can beimportant. Dual-sourcing, by avoiding\\ncomplete dependence on a single workforce or a single site, is an\\nobvious example. Another is thatmentioned earlier where a simple\\nshift of location may make it easier for management tointroduce a\\nnewproduction technique, or even simply new work practices.\\nGeographical mobility is often involved in attempts to bring new\\nsocial groups into the workforce. The detailed choice of a local site\\nmight have a kind ofsymbolic significance and effect. In Greenock,\\nScotland, the detailed location ofIBM issignificant and apparently\\nhighly effective. The company employs male workers in an area\\ntraditionally associated with shipbuilding and heavy engineering.\\nInto this contextIBMbroughtademand for relatively unskilled\\nlabourand adetermination to establish a non-union plant(Steuer\\netal.,1973). Workers werechosen carefully, not on the basis ofskill\\nbut on being \\'therightsortofperson\\' for the IBM project, people\\nwho would fit in with the task required, \\'areliable and responsible\\ntype of person\\'. Unionisation was to be avoided at all costs, and\\nconditions andstartingpay were good relative to the area. The\\nresulting social set-upat the factory cut acrossmanyofthe\\nestablished work mores of the district (Steuer et al..1973). And\\nthe whole effect was reinforced by the site ofthe plant. As the\\nSteuerreportput it: the company standsapart,both socially and\\ngeographically.The location far from the town, in a pleasantvalley,\\naway from all otherplacesofemployment, contributes to the\\nseparateness and symbolises the philosophy.\\nOne ofcapital\\'s crucialadvantages overlabouris its great, and\\nincreasing, geographical mobility. Time and again throughthe hist\\xad\\norical development of industry whole sectors have shifted location\\nto escape a well-organised workforce, thereby both lowering labour 56SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ncosts and re-establishing the controlling power of capital over\\nlabour- the movement of the hosiery industry in the United\\nKingdom fromLondon to themidlands from the eighteenth\\ncentury (Wells, 1972) and of the textile industry in the United\\nStates from New England to the south are justtwo of the better\\nknown examples. In these cases, and in some of those givenearlier,\\nit is not simple geographical mobility which is at issue but mobility\\nbeyond the spatial boundaries oforganisational coherence of the\\nemployees. Again, \\'space itself(in the sensehere of separateness, or\\ndistance) guarantees noparticular outcome. The spatial mobility of\\ncapitalis pitted against the geographical solidarity oflabour.\\nFinally, and implicit in all of these, capital can make positive use,\\nin a way labourcannot, ofdistance anddifferentiation. The\\napproach to the analysis of spatial structures which is introduced\\ninChapter3 is designed precisely to enable this to be examined.\\nThe\\'orderof analysis\\', then, in social sciencesshould not be first\\ntheaspatial, or the\\'aggregate\\' (often conceived as the aspatial) and\\nthen the distribution over space; first production and only then\\nlocation. \\'Geography\\' shouldbepartof the specification from the\\nbeginning. The reproduction of social and economic relations and\\nof the social structure takes place over space, and thatconditions its\\nnature.\\nPlaces and politics\\nSocial relations and social structure, and the character of both\\nlabourand capital, can vary quite dramatically within an individual\\ncountry. Oneelement ofthis is simply thattherelationsof\\nproduction are unevenly distributed over space and so, therefore,\\nare theconstituent social classes and social groups. Thatis a large\\npartof the subject matterof this book. But it is also thatthe\\nconstitution ofsocialgroupsactually occurs\\'spatially\\', i.e. in\\nplaces. We have already argued that economic function within the\\nrelations of production isnot an adequate basisfor \\'whole empirical\\nclasses\\' and thatother social relations and ties and commonalities\\ncan form the basis for intraclass, and cross-class, variation and\\nantagonism .Geographical separation and distance can operatein\\nprecisely that way. One element of this is thatthe wider social\\nrelations (wider, thatis, than the world of work) in which social Social Relationsand Spatial Organisation 57\\ngroupsareconstituted andreproduced are inmanywaysspatially\\nbounded. Theplace-based relations between work and community,\\nforinstance, formpartofwhatWrightwould call structural class\\ncapacities . And they are an important influence on local class\\ncharacter, and thus on geographical variation inthatcharacter.\\nThenatureoftheeconomic base itself can give rise to long-lingering\\nlocalcharacteristics .Compare theindividualistic stroppiness of\\nMerseyside workers, with a long historybehindthemofcasual\\nlabouron the docks, with the organised discipline ofminers from\\nSouthWales (see Beynon, 1973, pp. 70-1). The enormously varied\\ngeographical patchwork which forms the industrial base even within\\noneadvanced capitalist countryis still of fundamental importance\\nas a basis ofsocial and cultural variations, local loyalties, and\\ntherefore potential misunderstandings andantagonisms within, in\\nparticular, thenational working class.Itis never justaquestion\\nmerelyofindustrial history,ofcourse.Thecontrast between\\nCatholicism andnonconformism has clearly also been important\\nin the difference between Liverpool and the Welsh valleys. Local\\ncultures andtraditions oforganisation can develop a life oftheir\\nown - the bargaining strength ofCoventry carworkers is an\\nexample.\\nThere have at times in recent years been flurries ofdebateover\\nwhether one can identify in Britaintoday\\'regional classes\\', and\\nwhat such a term might mean. A\\'regional class\\' would seem to\\nrefer not to a national class or stratum which is geographically\\nconcentrated (there are examples ofthese) but to such a degree of\\ngeographical differentiation within a class thatthe elements demand\\nseparate definition. Fora while the debatewasboundup withthat\\naboutthe useofdependency theoryinintranational analysis. The\\nunderstanding whichinformsthisbookisthatwhatwe are dealing\\nwith in the UnitedKingdom aregeographical variations within\\nnational classes. The importance of thedebate,though, was to\\nemphasise theconsiderable, andgeographically-structured , variety\\nwhich lies behind a term such as \\'the British working class\\'.Noris\\nitjusttheworking class which is thus differentiated . Clearly, the\\nverydifferent natureof \\'capital\\' and the high degree ofitsspatial\\nmobility, in money form and as a social relation, meansthatas it\\ndevelops it can, more quickly thanlabour,freeitselffromparticular\\ngeographical bases. But long histories in particular partsof the\\ncountrycan still be important, even inmoulding thecharacter of 58 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ncapital. Local histories and local distinctiveness are integral to the\\nsocial nature of production relations which wehave already argued\\nshould be central to any attemptat \\'characterising capital\\'.\\nForboth capital and labourtwo parallel and related processes\\nare inoperation . On the one hand the business of overcoming\\ndistance, of the flexibilityof relations over space and the movement\\ntowards the formation ofsupraregional andsupranational links and\\nallegiances . On the otherhand,and inparallel, thegradual\\ndestruction of local distinctiveness. Forcapital,bothchanges are\\nproceeding apace, and on the whole both add strengthto its arm.\\nForthe working class the process ismore one-sided and ambiguous.\\nTheformation ofany kind ofinterregional andinternational\\nconsciousness is slow and halting. Yet even while wider links are\\ndifficult to establish, localdistinctiveness isoften being undermined.\\nAnd for the working class, local distinctiveness can be both a\\ndisadvantage - inproducing divisions at a higher level- and the\\nsourceoflocal coherence and strength. The balance between gain\\nanddisadvantage isthe object of struggle and open to question. But\\nwhatever the future holds, it is clear thatgeography, and class\\nrelations to geography, will remain offundamental importance .\\nAll this is still to talk in class terms, of differentiation within\\nclasses. But political subjects, as we have seen, are not always\\ndefined in class terms, and one possibility is thatnon-class political\\nsubjects are defined in spatialterms - in terms of locality.\\nSome intraclass (or cross-class) spatial differences can develop to\\nsuch an extent thatgeography itself may become a politically self\\xad\\nconsciously chosen and defining characteristic. People in different\\npartsof thecountryexperience different economic fortunes at any\\none time; \\'thecrisis\\' hits different regions in different ways. People\\ndemand jobs- for their region, their locality, their inner city.\\nVariationsin levelsofprosperity, in the kinds of class dynamics, in\\nkindsofconflict, mean thatlocalsubgroups may face highly\\ncontrasting immediate problems, and have very different immedi\\xad\\nateinterests, evenantagonistic ones, at anyone time. Such\\ndifferences and antagonisms are often exacerbated through tacit\\nencouragement. The open hostility ofpeople in London and\\nBirmingham to the regional policy ofthe 1960s,designed to divert\\njobs to the peripheral regions, is a case in point. At such junctures,\\ntheprimaryaspectofgroupdefinition and allegiance may become\\ngeographical. Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 59\\nMore obviously, the constitution of some political subjects isfrom\\nthe beginning and by definition spatial. Community groupsare a\\nclear example at the very local end ofthegeographical spectrum,\\nwhileat the otheristhe whole host of \\'regional\\' issueswhich,at least\\nin Europe,from Catalonia toLaplandand from CroatiatoScotland,\\nhave figured increasingly prominently innationalpolitical debate. A\\nnumber ofanalysts,such as Urry (1981a)and Nairn(1981),in rather\\ndifferent ways suggest that this kind of impact of geography may be\\nincreasingin importance at themomentwithin the United Kingdom.\\nEither way, the general point is that, whatever the political subjects,\\nthey are formed in the context of social processes and conflicts, and\\nthese take place in places.\\nAparticularly clearexample todayoftheimportance of\\ngeographical variation can be seen in Belgium. There, the very\\nprocess of forming a nationalgovernment has been made extremely\\nhazardous byinterregional differences and antagonisms which\\nresult from a combination ofcontrasting economic fortunes and\\ncultural and linguistic backgrounds, and which at times have\\neruptedinto street violence. Inan early article, Mandel (1963)\\npointed to the very different classhistories ofFlanders and\\nWallonia as theconditioning forcebehindthelong-running\\nantagonisms. Thecompetitive strength of Belgian industry, he\\nargued, was based on a combination ofadvanced technology and\\ndepressed wages. And one of the causes of the very low wage levels\\nwas regional differentiation . \\'Belgium was only halfindustrialised,\\nforFlanders remained essentially agricultural. The cost ofliving,\\ntherefore, remained low and there was always an abundant reserve\\narmy oflabourto keep wage levelsto a minimum\\' (p. 8). It isan old\\nstory, and one which can be told, in different ways, for many\\nEuropean countries at different stages of their development: from\\nBritain in the early nineteenth century, and again to some extent\\nbetween the wars, to Italy for virtually all ofthe lasthundred years.\\nThose regional wage differentials in Belgium were not simply a\\nproductof different industrial structures. Norindeed was it only\\nwage-differences thatwerein question. The \\'ruralareas\\'ofFlanders\\nweredominated not only by a particular branch of the economy\\n(agriculture), but also by a specific set of social relations.

Social Relations and SpatialOrganisation 61\\n2.5Anexample\\nAspects ofthisapproach have been illustrated insomerecent\\nanalyses of Italy, in particular thoseby Secchi (1974 and1977).\\nSecchi\\'s thesis is thatanimportant link between the development of\\ntheItalianeconomy as a whole andthedevelopment ofregional\\ndisparities within it has been the changing useoflabourandthe\\nrelatedtechnical changesinproduction . Hepointsto the fact that\\nsince the end ofthenineteenth century theItalianeconomy has\\nexperienced contrasting phasesin the use of labourandthatthese\\nhavecoincided withchangesininterregional disparities. Heargues\\nfurtherthatthesedifferent stages of development have reflected\\ndifferent economic andlocational strategies in themajordivisions\\noftheItalianeconomy andtheeconomic andpolitical hegemony of\\ndifferent socialgroups,themselves relatedto thesemajordivisions .\\nSecchi\\'scharacterisation ofdifferent partsoftheeconomy enables\\nhim toestablish arelationship between, first, variouscharacteristics\\nofproduction (production technology andtheorganisation of\\nlabour, labourdemand, sizeandsocialstructure ofcapital),\\nsecond,locational strategy,andthird, theconnections to the\\nvarious armsofStatepolicy,including regional policy,and\\nconsequently to the main systems ofpolitical allianceandconflict\\nwithincapitalas a whole.\\nThe divisions identified by Secchi in his characterisation of\\nItaliancapitalreflect the particular importance inthatcountry of\\ndifferentiation between large and small companies andofthe role of\\ntheStateinproduction . The\\'organisational structure ofcapital\\'\\nemerges, in otherwords, as particularly important , withnumerous\\nindustries (textiles, food and drink,mechanical engineering , light\\nchemicals , etc.) being dichotomised between a few large firms and\\nnumerous small ones. This division is one which is also often\\nreflected in theorganisation ofthelabourprocess. Thusthe\\ndistinction between large and small firms in sectorssuch as textiles\\nand food, drinkandtobacco mirrorsadifference not only in the\\nkindofcapitalinvolved butalso in the typicalproduction\\ntechnology andlabourprocess. The second main,thoughvery\\nbroad,lineofpartition reflectsmajorstructural divisions withinthe\\neconomy. Secchi\\'s characterisation ofItaliancapital, inother\\nwords, is bothspecific to Italy(thereis nochanceofimporting it\\nunmodified to theUnitedKingdom) andbearsa clearrelationto\\nhisanalysis ofthemainfactorsin thecountry\\'seconomic 62 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ndevelopment. It reflectsthe importance, within that development, of\\nthe dual processes ofhigh levelsof technological advance, in certain\\nperiods and in certain industries, alongside the continued preserva\\xad\\ntionofimportant \\'traditional\\' sectors.\\nMoreover, thischaracterisation ofItaliancapitalmakes it\\npossible to establish coherent relations between the division ofthe\\neconomy and a wide range ofothercharacteristics and forms of\\nbehaviour. Apartfrom obviously closely related aspects such as\\nchanges in technology and the organisation ofwork and the\\nmovement of labourproductivity, these include also such things\\nas the flows oflabourbetween sectors, the relation to the land\\nmarket,the relation to different arms ofState policy, and the main\\nsystemsofalliance and conflict. This last - the main systems of\\nalliance and conflict - refers to the positions taken by capital in\\neachpartof the economy to a whole variety of issues, both political\\nand economic. The fact thateachparttends to be affected in a\\nparticular way bynationalandinternational economic changes, and\\nthatwithin each the constituent elements have similar internal\\ncharacteristics, leads tocharacteristic groupings (i.e.. alliances and\\nconflicts) on such issuesas foreign trade policy,domestic policieson\\nnationalised industries, on laboursupply, training, etc., on incomes\\npolicy and, of course, on regional policy. The introduction ofthis\\naspectofthedifferentiation ofcapitalwithin an economy is\\nextremely important, for it allows links to be made not only\\nbetweennationaland regional policies,and the attitudeof different\\npartsofcapital to these, but also between the more purely economic\\nand the political determinants of uneven regional development, and\\nthe influence ofeach upon the other. This system ofpolitical\\nalliances is a main organising principleofthe analysis. Itisthrough\\nthatpolitical level thatthe impact of economic forces is translated.\\nSecchi\\'s characterisation ofthedevelopment oftheItalian\\neconomy as an alternation ofphasesofextensive and intensive\\ndevelopment, each ofwhich has distinct implications for the degree\\nandnatureofthedisparity between northandsouthofthat\\ncountry, is not therefore a characterisation merelyof\\'economic\\'\\nphases. The periodisation refers also to changing class relations,\\nand inparticular to changing relations between different partsof\\ncapitalon the one hand and different partsoflabouron the other.\\nSecchi states thathis \\'thesis is thatthe different phases correspond\\nto different development strategies pursued by the various leading\\neconomic sectors and social groups\\'(Secchi, 1977, p. 47). The Social Relations and Spatial Organisation 63\\nanalysis takes account notjustofthemajoreconomic phasesof\\ndevelopment, but also ofthe political strategies adopted to deal\\nwith them. The effects ofeconomic changesareunderstood as being\\ntranslated through politics; they are not the raw requirements of\\naccumulation . The essential unifying characterisation ofaparticu\\xad\\nlarperiodisbotheconomic and political, and itiscontradictions\\narticulated atthatlevel which markthe shift from one phase into a\\nnew one.\\nThus,the crisis of1963/4 - the end oftheItalianmiracle - was\\nnot simply an economic crisis,thoughitcertainly wasthat; it also\\nmarkedthe collapse ofa political alliance between different partsof\\ncapital,an alliance which had in the preceding periodheld sway\\nover the main lines ofeconomic and regional policy in Italy. Both\\n\\'miracle\\' andsubsequent crisis must, in otherwords, be defined in\\npolitical and class terms. Secchi argues thatthe extensive develop\\xad\\nmentofthe 1950s was a productof thedominance ofan alliance\\nbetween sectors ofindustry producing intermediate goods, largely\\ndominated by bigcapital,and large and mediumfirms in a range of\\notherindustries on the one hand,and those in the building industry\\non theother.It had been characterised by a high rate ofincreaseof\\nemployment (corresponding to thenotionofan \\'extensive\\' phase),\\nand by a high rate ofaggregate growthandofexports. Moreover,\\nthis fast rate ofgrowthinemployment occurred mainly in the\\nnorth,attracting increased migration from the south. These flows of\\nlabourled inturnto faster urbanisation and,particularly, to a high\\nrateofinvestment inhousing (hence the participation ofthe\\nbuilding sectorin the alliance). As a result ofthis, and also\\nbecauseofincreased wagedifferentials between the advanced\\nsectorsandothers,theregional effectofthealliance was an\\nincrease in the disparity between northandsouth. By 1958, this\\nstrategyofextensive development was beginning to come up against\\ndeepinternalcontradictions (Secchi, 1977, p. 43).The profligate use\\noflabourwas leading, in spite of migration, totighterlabour\\nmarkets andincreased money-wages. But more importantly in\\nSecchi\\'s analysis it was leading to \\'excessive\\' development ofthe\\nbuilding sector, a development which was due, precisely, to the\\ngeographical concentration of thelabourforce and of the popula\\xad\\ntion and which brought in its train soaringrents and all the\\nproblems ofover-rapidurbanisation. And,ofcourse,thaturban\\nconcentration was itself due in large measure to thepriorities of the\\nindustrial strategyof the 1950s. 64 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nTheeconomic crisisof1963/4 wasalso a political conflict between\\ntwopartsofthe ruling alliance:the advanced industrial sectors, and\\nthebuilding industry.Itwas,moreover, a crisis in which spatial\\ndisparities and the results oflocational change were themselves an\\nimportant component. The political alliance, throughitseconomic\\nstrategy, hadmajorspatialeffects(over-rapid urbanconcentration\\nandexacerbated regionalinequality) , and the repercussions ofthose\\neffects were, in turn,partofthe reason for its collapse. Spatial\\nstructure wascause aswellaseffect, inextricably intertwined with the\\ndevelopment ofeconomic and political processes.\\nIt was at this period thattheCentreLeft was formed, and the\\ncrisis in the ruling alliance was countered byproposals for \\'re\\xad\\nform\\'. These proposals had astrongterritorial content, bothurban\\nand regional, and on bothscores led to furtherconflict. On the\\nurbansidetherewereproposals forplanned controlofcity\\ndevelopment and for transfers of resources towards those social\\ngroupsmost affected by the increase in rents which had accom\\xad\\npaniedurbanisation and the boom in the building industry. The\\nproposals tocurburbangrowth were resisted and sharpintracapi\\xad\\ntalist conflict ensued (Secchi, 1977,pp.48-9).Similar battles took\\nplace over the attemptto establish a Tegional policy which, while\\nhaving aspects ofa social reform, could also have increased the\\ntotalamountoflabouravailable , thus reducing pressure on wages.\\nObviously, these conflicts were not justbetweendifferent partsof\\ncapital. \\'Tightlabourmarkets\\' and \\'pressure on wages\\' were\\nindications ofincreased potential strength amongtheworking\\nclass. In a situation ofnear \\'full employment\\' capitalist discipline\\nbecameharderto keep; the threatofdismissal became lesseffective.\\nThose who, migrating north,had for the first time joinedthe\\nnational industrial working class,understood and used their new\\xad\\nfoundstrength. In thisbattle, too, policy on the employers \\' front\\nwas by no means united. In a situation ofrelativelabourshortage\\nthere were frequent competitive wage increases and attempts by\\ndifferent partsofcapitaltomonopolise typesoflabourwhich had\\nbecomeparticularly scarce (Salvati, 1972, p. 15).\\nMuchofthe energy ofthe ruling alliance was thus also directed,\\noftenthrough thereforms themselves, againstthisnew-found\\nstrengthoftheworking class. The results ofall this, and therefore\\nthe future oflocation patterns andofregional inequality, thus\\nrested on the outcome ofa political battle, in which \\'geography\\'\\nitself was an integral element. 3\\nUnevenDevelopment andSpatial\\nStructures\\n3.1 The approach\\nIf the social is inextricably spatialand the spatialimpossible to\\ndivorce from its social construction andcontent, it follows not only\\nthat social processes shouldbeanalysed astakingplacespatially but\\nalso that whathave been thoughtofasspatialpatterns can be\\nconceptualised in termsofsocial processes.\\nOneoftheproblems ofthe \\'correlation ofmaps\\'approach to\\nindustrial locationisthatit is inclined to interpret the geography of\\nemployment as a two-dimensional pattern- morejobsin this region\\nthan that, more white-collar jobsherethanthere, etc. In a very\\nliteral sense it looks at the surfacephenomenon andconceptualises\\nit in terms ofitspatternas a surface. Itis on the basis ofthis\\npatterning thatexplanations , which are often embodied in similar\\nkindsofpatterns, aresought. (Hence the desire to explain\\ngeographical regularities ?) But if such geographical patterns are\\ntheoutcome ofsocioeconomic processes (operating over space) then\\ninordertounderstand apatternwe must go behind it and interpret\\nit in terms ofthestructure s and processes on which it is based. The\\ngeography ofemployment , inotherwords, can be conceptualised ,\\nnot only as a two-d imensional pattern- asthoughit were a purely\\nspatialphenomenon - but in terms ofthe social structures on which\\nit rests and the social processes ofwhich it is the outcome. The\\nprimary social process which the geography ofjobsreflects is\\nproduction. Thespatialdistribution ofemployment ,therefore , can\\nbeinterpreted as theoutcome ofthe way in which production is\\norganised over space. The question is, how to do it.\\nOne key to getting behind the two-dimensional viewofthe\\ngeography ofemployment isto begin by conceptualising that\\ngeography in terms ofthe social relations ofproduction.\\nThe fact that one region has jobsonly in direct production while\\nanotherclaims all the headquarters, orthatareas differ in their\\n65 66SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ndominant industries, orthatin oneareathejobson offer are\\noverwhelmingly manualwhile inanotherthere is a sizeable slice of\\nwhite-col\\\\ar andwell-paid employment inresearch, all these\\ndifferences reflect different forms of geographical organisation of\\ntherelations ofproduction. Whatare often called \\'interregional\\nrelations\\' Ireflect the same thing. Structures ofdominance and\\nsubordination between economic activities in different placesmirror\\nthe way in which, in any particular case, the relations ofproduction\\nareorganised over space. \\'Interregional relations\\' are therelations\\nofproduction over space.\\nThe aim, then, is to link two discussions - the one concerning\\nproduction and social class, and the otherconcerning spatial\\norganisation. Inrelationto much previous analysis within geogra\\xad\\nphy, the argument isthatwhat has been seen simply as the spatial\\ndistribution ofemployment isunderlain by, and can beapproached\\nthrough, analysis of the geographical organisation oftherelations\\nofproduction . Inrelation to thesubstantive social sciences the\\nargument isthatthe social structure oftheeconomy, the social\\nrelations ofproduction , necessarily develop spatially and in a\\nvarietyofforms. These forms we shal\\\\ call spatial structures of\\nproduction.\\nFrombothdisciplinary vantagepointsthisapproach highlights\\nthe fact that\\'space\\'is not a passive surface on to which the\\nrelations ofproduction aremapped, nor yet simply a negative\\nconstraint (in the sense, for instance, ofdistanceto be crossed). The\\nfactofspatiality is an integral and active condition. Inrelationto\\nproduction, spatialform and spatialstrategy canbean active\\nelementofaccumulation .Capitalcan make positive use ofdistance\\nanddifferentiation .Thischapterwillbegin to formulate someofthe\\nways it can do this, and to examine their effects.\\nIt isimportant to stress thatthereisa whole variety ofways in\\nwhichcapitalist production can beorganised geographically and\\ngreatvarietyin the way the relations ofproduction can be\\nstructured over space. Manydifferent ways in which, in other\\nwords, the facts of distance andofgeographical variation can he\\nactively used in the process ofproduction and theaccumulation of\\ncapital.Thisenormous variation is notimmediately apparent from\\ntheliterature, particularly thatconcerning largecapital.Therehas\\nbeen an unfortunate tendency toassume thattheformof\\norganisation identified in a particular study is replicated in all\\notherpartsoftheeconomy , or if it is not, then it soon will be, for Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 67\\nthetendency is inthatdirection.

But the evidentcorollary isthatnoneofthem can be the\\nmodel of geographical behaviour for the whole ofmultilocational\\ncapital.\\nTheargument here isthatthere is no need for such a model, such\\nanarchetype .Whatthischapterdoes is to recognise from the start\\nthe existence and importance of variety.

As inChapter 2,whatis being presented is a frame\\xad\\nwork, not a blueprint.\\nBut, as was also emphasised inthatchapter, this stress on the\\nneed to confront empirical varietyshouldin no way be seen as\\nlicence to retreatintounsituated descriptive empiricism. Muchof\\nthe factual information produced by such studies,forinstance of\\nmanagerial structures , can indeed be given meaning byreformula\\xad\\ntion in terms oftheapproach suggested here. Manyoftheempirical\\ncharacteristics ofcompanies referred to in subsequent sectionsof\\nthischapterhave been described before. The aim here is reconcep\\xad\\ntualisation ; theconstruction ofabroaderframework. 68SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nThechallenge is toconstruct anapproach which is neither\\ndetailed description and empiricism nor a \\'mechanistic Marxist\\'\\ninsensitivity. Itis possible bothto recognise specificity and to\\nsituateit within the grander historical movements ofcapitalist\\nsocieties.\\n3.2Spatialstructures of capitalist production\\nConceptualising the spatial organisation ofproduction\\nEachofthedifferent archetypes mentioned in theintroduction to\\nthischapter represents apossible formoforganisation ofthe\\nrelations ofproduction over space. Let us begin by examining one\\nofthemfurther,anduncovering itsunderlying characteristics . One\\nofthebest-known formsofspatialorganisation atpresentisthat\\nwhich draws on the characteristics ofmulti-locational companies in\\nindustries such as electronics. It is usually described in terms ofa\\nhierarchy in which RandD andstrategic functions areperformed\\nat theheadquarters locationand there are a numberofotherplants,\\nfor simplicity say two, each in a different region, one branchplant\\nmanufacturing complex components , theotherbeing where the final\\nassembly iscarriedout. It is a spatialstructure which is well\\nrecognised at bothinternational andintranational levels.\\nWhatisinteresting aboutthisgeographical form isthat, when\\nexamined in termsoftheorganisation oftherelations ofproduction\\nover space, it is not one hierarchy at all, but a whole complex of\\nthem.Forthemoment they areconveniently treatedas twogroups.\\nMoreover, what these two different bundlesofhierarchies represent\\nis twodistinct,thoughrelated, aspects ofthedevelopment ofthe\\nrelations ofproduction incapitalist societies; two distinctaspectsof\\nthedynamic ofcapitalisteconomies.\\nThe first hierarchy isthatwhichconnects thedifferent plants,and\\nhence the different locations, in terms oftheirstatusas head\\xad\\nquartersorbranchplants.This iswhat might becalled a managerial\\nhierarchy and along it run the functions offinancial and adminis\\xad\\ntrativecontrol.Itmay bethatat HQ the long-range investment\\ndecisions are taken,which then form the parameters foractionfor\\nmanagement atbranchlevel.Itis at HQ too thatultimate control\\nover theproduction process, and ultimateauthority over thelabour\\nforce, is likely to lie. Such a hierarchy can beconceptualised in Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 69\\ntermsoftherelations ofproduction. Whatthisaspectofinter-plant\\nrelations represents is aparticular formofspatialorganisation of\\ntherelations ofeconomic ownership and therelations ofpossession.\\nFigure3.1indicates onebroadandgeneral form which these\\nrelations might take.\\nCapitalist development has been characterised bothby the\\nseparation ofeconomic ownership frompossession and by the\\ndevelopment ofcomplex hierarchies offunctions within each. In\\nthis aspect of the organisation ofmulti-Iocational companies we see\\nthesecomplex hierarchies spreadoutoverspace.Behindthe\\ndescriptive terms \\'headquarters\\' and \\'branch plant\\'lies a form of\\ngeographical organisation ofpartsoftherelations ofproduction .\\nIndeed, thedevelopment andincreasing complexity ofthese\\nrelations took place over space and in a geographically differen\\xad\\ntiatedcontext. Multi-Iocationality itself, as much as the increasing\\nsize of firms (the only thing usually referred to) musthave been\\nimportant inproducing the need for such hierarchies andin\\ninfluencing the forms whichthey have taken and the kinds of\\ndivisionoflabourwhich have developed within these functions.\\n\\'Geography\\' has been an essential constructive element in their\\ndevelopment.\\nOne bundle ofrelations in this\\'electronics archetype\\' , then, can\\nbe referred to broadlyas amanagement hierarchy, anditrepresents\\nthespatialhierarchisation oftherelations ofeconomic ownership\\nand possession.\\nIn the electronics example, however, this hierarchy isparalleled\\nbyanother-thatwithin the process ofproduction itself.RandD is\\nseparated from the production oftechnically morecomplex\\ncomponents, andthatinturnfrom the final assembly ofthe\\ncommodity . In this spatialstructure eachofthesestagesof\\nproduction isbothlocatedseparately from the othersandunder\\nthecontrolofthe same company.\\nInotherwords, in this case not only is the hierarchy ofrelations\\nofownership and possession spreadout indifferent locations but so\\nalsois thetechnical, ordetailed, division oflabourwithin\\nproduction. And in the electronics example someofthe\\'classic\\'\\ncharacteristics ofthatdivisionoflabourshow up very well. The\\nsequence ofstagesofproduction forms ahierarchy whichrepresents\\ndifferent degreesofremovalofjobcontrol(theindividual worker\\'s\\ncontrolover the physical means ofproduction), anddeskilling. In\\nthisparticular case the hierarchy represents also a very clear 70SpatialDivisions of Labour\\nDEGREE OF CONTROL OVER:\\nRelations ofpossession\\nRelations of\\neconomic controlof controlof\\nownership meansofproduction labour power\\n~\\nFULL FULL FULL\\ni.e.control over the i.e.control over entire i.e.control over the\\noverall investment and apparatus of entire supervisory\\naccumulation process production hierarchy\\nand\\nPARTIAL\\nparticipation in\\ndecisions concerning\\neither sub-units of the\\ntotalproduction\\nprocess or partial\\naspects of the entire\\nproduction process\\nIBRANCHI\\nPARTIAL PARTIAL PARTIAL\\nparticipation in control over one control over one\\ndecisions concerning a segment of the total segment of the\\nsub-unitofthe total production process supervisory\\nproduction process hierarchy\\nor\\nMINIMAL\\nparticipation in\\ndecisions concerning\\nnarrowaspects of\\nsub-units of production\\nFIGURE3.1Managerial hierarchies and relations ofownership and\\npossession: a basic shape\\nSource: adapted from Wright (1976).\\ndistinction between the functions ofconception on the one hand\\nandexecution on theother, with the paralleldivision between an\\nemphasis onmentallabourandmanual.

Inthisexample, however, the\\ndifferent stages in the technical division of labouraredistinguished\\nalso bylocationallyrelevantcharacteristics -aboveall by the kind\\noflabourwhich each predominantly needs.Braverman (1974), in\\nhisanalysisof thedevelopment of the technical divisionoflabourin\\ncapitalist economies, pointsoutthatnot only are the operations\\nseparated from each other,butthey are assigned todifferent\\nworkers. An exact parallelcan be drawn here with locations: not\\nonly is there a technical division of labourwithinproduction, but\\nthedifferent stages of it are assigned to different regions. More\\xad\\nover,justas the division oflabourbetween different workers can 72SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nincreaseproductivity and thereby profit, so can its division between\\nregions, by enabling thedifferent stagesofproduction each to\\nrespondmore exactly to their own specific location factors.Spatial\\nstructure , inotherwords, is an active element in accumulation.\\nMoreover , precisely becausegeographical form can influence the\\nrateofaccumulation , it may well be thatoneoftheconditions for\\nthedevelopment ofparticular kindsoftechnical division oflabour\\nwithinproduction in the first place is the existence ofparticular\\nkindsofgeographical differentiation , forinstance in thelabour\\nmarket.Inotherwords, it is not only that\\'thedifferent stages in the\\ntechnical division oflabouraredistinguished bylocationally\\nrelevant characteristics\\' and are therefore spreadout indifferent\\nlocations. Itis alsothatthe very existence ofsuch differences\\nbetween locations may be a stimulus to thedevelopment ofa\\ntechnical division oflabourwhich enables advantage to betakenof\\nthem.?\\nThereare, then, even at the most general level ofanalysis,\\ndistinguishable within this classic spatialstructure twohierarchies ,\\norbundlesof hierarchies, each reflecting different aspectsofthe\\ndivisionoflabourwithin a capitalist society, and each representing\\nadifferent set offunctions withdifferent internal relations of\\ndominance andsubordination .\\n* * *Notallmulti-Iocat ionalcompanies , not even the biggest and most\\nmodern ones, have this kind ofspatialstructure. The way the\\nrelations ofproduction areorganised over space may vary enor\\xad\\nmously both between sectors and between individual firms. Take,\\nfor instance, the case where there is a headquarters /branch-plant\\nstructure but where the whole process ofproduction takes place at\\neach site. The only difference between the plantsisthatone is the\\nheadquarter s and the othersare branches.\\nHere there is one hierarchy only,thatof\\'management functions\\',\\nbroadlydefined. Only the functions of investment ,supervision and\\ncontrolover the production process - the relations ofeconomic\\nownership andpossession - arespreadoutoverspace.The\\nproduction process itself remains geographically undifferentiated .\\nIt may be thatthere is a division oflabourwithinproduction but\\nthat,for one reason or another, thevariouspartsare kept together\\non one site, or it may be thatthere is not a very markedtechnical\\ndivision of labourwithin the process ofproduction underthe\\nownership of a single capital.Incontrast with the part-process Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 73\\nstructure of the last example, this is a case ofwhatmight be called\\nsimple \\'cloning\\'. Examples abound.Medium-sized firms in the\\nclothing industry oftenhave this structure, as domanymulti-plant\\ncompanies manufacturing finalconsumer goodswhich need to be\\nproduced verynearto themarket, largenumbers ofplantssimply\\nbeingreplicated indifferent geographical areas-Coca-Cola\\nbottling plantscometomind.Dual-sourcing is astrategy of\\ncloningadopted for adifferent reason - to guarantee continuity\\nofproduction , usually by undermining thepotential monopoly\\ncontrolof aworkforce in one place over a particular production\\nprocess.\\n* * *As a third example, takewhatisprobably thesimplest spatial\\nstructure of all - the autonomous single-region firm. Here the whole\\nprocessofproduction of acommodity isconcentrated within a\\nsinglegeographical area.\\'Whatever managerial hierarchy exists,\\nandwhatever the division oflabourwithin the processofproduc\\xad\\ntion, it is all locatedwithin one area. Such a spatialstructure is\\nobviously most likely to characterise companies which are small,\\nnotjustin these geographical terms, but also in employment and\\nfinancial terms. CrumandGudgin(1977), for instance,comment on\\nthe fact thatmostBritish-owned companies which are small in\\nemployment terms are confined to one region (para. 275). Such\\ncompanie s are likely also to have a relatively simpleinternal\\nstructure .Theremay be no well developed technical divisionof\\nlabourwithin the process of production ,andlittle in the way ofa\\ncomplex division oflabourwithin the relations ofeconomic own\\xad\\nershipandpossession .Although there is by no meansaone-to-one\\ncorrespondence between the lack of a sufficiently developed tech\\xad\\nnical division oflabourandsmallcompanies ,nonethe less the lack\\nofasignificant division oflabourwithinproduction, since it\\nfrequently implies also a lack ofmajoreconomies ofscale, isoften\\nanenabling condition at least for the survival andcontinued entry\\nof small companies ,andcertainly there isconsiderable empirical\\ncorrespondence between the two.\\n* * *These three examples ofspatialstructures -part-process ,cloning\\nandconcentrated - are set outdiagrammatically inFigure3.3.\\nWhatthe three structures illustrate are three fairly simple cases. In\\nthese clear forms they are unlikely to be found very often\\'in the real\\nworld\\' and the intention is not to set offasearchfor them. The 74 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nexamples are intended toillustrate something ofwhatit means to\\nsaythattherelations ofproduction can bespatially organised in a\\nvarietyofdifferent ways,andindicate ameansby which the\\ncomplexity with which empirical analysis is faced can be ap\\xad\\nproached .Itis easy to think ofnumerous otherpossible struc\\xad\\ntures.Conglomerate ownership, forexample , inwhichthe\\nproduction of a wide range ofdifferent commodities isunderthe\\nsame financial control. Product-cycle structures , where the grip of\\nbothfinancial and scientific controlis relaxed as products mature.\\nOrcombinations -part-process structures combined with dual\\xad\\nsourcing, for instance. And once again it is not legal forms but\\nrealrelations which are crucial. Subcontracting systems can involve\\nonecompany in \\'realownership\\' ofanother, forinstance, or a firm\\nmay be operating in asituation wherepartof thefunctions of\\nownership and possession lie with a bankor financial institution .\\nAll of these potentially represent different structures oftherelations\\nofproduction over space. The pointhere is not to establish an all\\xad\\nembracing typology, but to use a few examples as vehicles for\\nillustrating anapproach .\\nMoreover ,withinthesebroadforms there may be great variation\\nin the way in which each partoftherelations ofproduction is\\norganised spatially.Withinthemanagerial structure there are many\\nways in which the different functions can beorganised ; those of\\neconomic ownership may not form a hierarchy inparallelwith\\nthoseofpossession, for instance.Fashions change, too. The \\'matrix\\napproach\\', pioneered byconsultants in the days of technocratic\\nrationality in the 1960s, is now seen, in the face of undreamt-of\\neconomic difficulties, as overwhelmingly complex and over-formal,\\nand there isa returnto morepragmatic, lessco-ordinated structures\\n(Hunsicker , 1982). Such shifts influence directly the geography of\\ntherelations ofproduction.\\nThe same applies to the production hierarchy. Thereare many\\ndifferent kindsoftechnical divisions oflabourwithinindividual\\nfirms, technical divisions oflabourwhich may be organised into\\ngeographical hierarchies. And they vary widely in their implications\\nfor the patternofemployment andthusfor the structure of\\ninterregional social difference. Figure3.4 gives some examples.\\nThediagram isnotmeanttoimplythatsuchpart-process\\nhierarchies always typify the sectorsnamed,still less thatthe\\ndifferent stages are always separately located.

Again, other technical divisions of labour\\nexist which, although hierarchically organised in terms of flows of\\ninputs, do not have such an obviously hierarchical form in social\\nterms.Part-process plants exist in many industries, and in some\\ncases do not employ distinct kinds of labour.\\nAll these aspects of social relations are integral to the organisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction withincapitalist societies. There is a clear\\ndistinction within such societies between the planned organisation\\nofproduction within each firm and the unplanned market relations\\nbetween them. The development of the technical division oflabour\\nwithin the production of aparticular productincreases the viability\\nofthe individual company in the overall competitive battle. Such\\ndivisions, once evolved, may provide the basis for whole new\\nbranches of production, underseparate ownership.\\nThe emergence of \\'producer services\\', first as a function within\\nthe division of labourinmanufacturing companies and subse\\xad\\nquently as an independent \\'sector\\', is a case in point. Conversely, it\\nis aspartof, and as a result of, such competitive pressures that\\ndifferent patterns ofownership areconstructed .Strategies of\\nvertical and horizontal integration, for instance, undertaken as\\nresponses to competitive pressures resulting from changing macro\\xad\\neconomic circumstances, represent the progressive transfer of parts\\nofproduction, whose relation was previously thatof theunplanned\\nElectronics Vehicles Chemicals Aspects ofthe division of\\nlabour within production\\nconceptualisation/mentalIRandD1 R and D labour; high degree of\\n-,Ijob control\\non-site mixed; some limited\\ncomplex parts components working controlover own labour\\nofproduction in plant process\\nTI execution;rassembly1IassemblyI repetition;\\nmanual labour;\\nno jobcontrol\\nFIGURE3.4Threedifferent part-process possibilities Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 77\\ncompetition ofthemarket,to realcontrolandco-ordination under\\na singleownership . Thedifferent aspectsofthe division of labour\\nwithinproduction reflect each otheranddevelopinrelationto each\\nother.Moreover, boththese facets ofthesocialrelations of\\nproduction haveshownclearlong-term developments. Over the\\nlong term within the development ofcapitalist economies, the\\npressures ofcompetition have led bothto increases in the size of\\nindividual firms and to the incorporation within them ofdifferent\\nprocesses ofproduction ,andto the finer andmorecomplex\\ndevelopment ofthedivision oflabourwithineachindividual\\nprocessofproduction.\\nThis is, then, not a statictaxonomy ofspatialstructures . The\\nemergence ofparticular kindsofspatialstructure willdependon the\\nlevelofdevelopment ofdifferent aspectsoftherelations of\\nproduction. They will only become possible at certainpointsin\\nthe overall development ofcapitalist societies. The tendencies in the\\ndevelopment ofcapitalist economies for the size ofindividual\\ncompanies toincrease, and for multi-plant ,multiregional and\\nmultinational companies to become more common has as its\\ncorollary thatthe significance of the simple-concentration form of\\nspatialstructure will recede. In contrast, thepart-process structure\\nis a relatively late arrivalon the scene.\\nTo talk, however, of\\'the overall development ofcapitalism \\', does\\nnot imply thatallpartsoftheeconomy are at the same stage of\\ndevelopment. Thepart-process structure isnotonly a late arrival,it\\nis also relatively rare and typical only of certainkindsof\\'advanced \\'\\nsectors of production . It by no means typifies even the whole ofthe\\nelectronics industry, nor indeed has it always been a possible spatial\\nstructure , even in this partofthe economy. Forit to become\\npossible it was necessary for specific developments to have taken\\nplacebothin the scope ofindividual companies and within the\\ntechnology ofproduction .Itwas necessary to have companies ofa\\nsufficient size and degree of integration to include within one\\nownership all the stagesfromresearch anddesignto final\\nassembly. These conditions shouldnot be taken for granted: there\\nareplentyofmono-functional companies whichperform only\\nresearch (UK mlh 876), and there are plenty ofsmall firms, within\\nthemanufacture ofindustrial instruments (UKmlh 354) for\\nexample, thatperform the whole range offunctions , but on one\\nsite.Neither ofthesesituations involves the use ofspatial\\ndifferentiation described above. Particular characteristics are also 78 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nrequired ofthetechnology ofproduction. Thepart-process\\nstructure inelectronics has indeed only evolved with the long-term\\ntechnological development of theindustry, andespecially with the\\nemergence and development ofcommodities andcomponents which\\ncan beproduced bymass-production techniques , and with the\\nreinforcement of these longer-term processes by the conditions of\\nfiercercompetition ofthe last twenty years (see, for instance,\\nSaxenian, 1979). It has, indeed, been precisely the conjunction of\\ntechnological andorganisational possibilities which has enabledthe\\nestablishment ofthis form of spatialstructure . And the corollary is\\nalso true. Notall firms with a spatially concentrated, even single\\xad\\nplant,structure aretechnologically backward .Similar spatial\\nstructures can beestablished by verydifferent kindsofcapital.In\\ntheproduction ofscientific instruments, massproduction and\\neconomies ofscale are difficult to achieve (save for certainsmall\\nsubsectors such as the production ofnumerically controlled\\nmachine tools)precisely as aresultofcontinuous technical\\nchange, particularly in thenatureoftheproduct (Oakey, 1978)\\nand themarketing conditions whichfrequently demand individual\\ncustomer specification .\" It may be, however, thatthere is indeed a\\nwell-developed internaldivisionoflabour,butthattheassociated\\nproduction requirements andpossibilities donotlead to a\\ngeographical separation ofthedifferent tasks. This in turnmay\\nresulteitherfrom the lack ofdifferent locational requirements for\\nthedifferent processes or from the organisational structure of\\ncapitalbeingofinsufficient scale or complexity to allow geogra\\xad\\nphicalseparation . Or it may be thatsuch a division oflabourwithin\\nproduction would be technically feasible butthatitsdevelopment is\\nnotencouraged by the existing character ofgeographical differ\\xad\\nentiation . So while there is a tendency for this kind ofspatial\\nstructure to become less important, it is not a unilateral tendency;\\nas was seen in Chapter 2, small firms are not simply a dying breed.\\nAlthough it may decline in overall importance, therefore, single\\xad\\nregionproduction is not aspatialstructure which can beuniquely\\nassociated withold-fashioned capital. Andit isunlikely to\\ndisappear.\\nNeitherareothertendencies all in one direction. Whileelectro\\xad\\nnics has been typified by the spreading outandgeographical\\ndifferentiation ofitsstagesofproduction, themetropolitan\\ncomplexes ofthe chemicals industry represent aconverse process\\noflocational integration. Withinpetrochemicals there is a clear Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 79\\nseries of technical stages within production, theoutputfrom each\\nstage being a different productin the chain (Laurencin et aI., 1977).\\nSometimes theseproducts aremarketed, sometimes they are\\nretained as inputs for the next stage ofproduction (G.Taylor,\\n1979).But whilethere isa clear series ofstages, they are not located\\nseparately. This is the opposite of what has been happening in\\nelectronics, where changes in the natureand degree ofcompetition\\nhavestimulated changes in the organisation ofcapitaland in the\\nprocess of production , allofwhich has both encouraged and\\nenabled locational subdivision . Inpetrochemicals , incontrast,\\nchanges in production concerning inparticular the relative im\\xad\\nportance of different raw materials, and the competitive need for\\neconomies of scale, have encouraged therelocation ofpreviously\\nseparate sites in large groups, or complexes. This process has been\\nfurtherstimulated by two things: firstly, by the fact thatthe\\ndifferent economic and technical stages of production are neither\\na response to nor, once established, responsive to distinctlocational\\nconsiderations ;secondly, because the sites, which would in any case\\nbe large, require such a vast amountofpreparation ,infrastructure\\nand often State aid, thateconomies are attainable by minimising\\ntheir number and grouping different processes together.\\nItis not enough to pointto the stage reached in the development\\nofcapitalist relations in ordertounderstand the complexity of\\nspatialstructures . There is a need also for specific and detailed\\nanalysis of the levelsand forms of development in different parts of\\nthe economy, and of their more specificcauses, which willbe found\\nin an analysis of more immediate conditions - in aparticular\\ndevelopment of managerial structure, perhaps, or a recent merger\\nboom, or a low levelof technological development. But, conversely,\\nneither is it sufficient only to do the more immediate analysis. Itis\\nimportant also to see the particular developments within the\\nbroaderframe of evolving social relations of which they are part.\\nAnd one aspect ofthis,as we have been arguing, is to conceptualise\\nthese\\'geographical patterns\\' in termsofthespatialstructuring of\\nthe relations of production .\\n* * *But why does all this matter? The argument here is that each\\ndifferent kindofspatial structure implies a distinct form ofgeogra\\xad\\nphical differentiation, ofgeographical inequality. This is so in two\\nways - in terms of the structures ofinterregional relations and in\\ntermsofthepatterns ofsocialdifferentiation between areas. 80SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nGeographical unevendevelopment doesnotvary only in degree, as\\nsomeofthearguments aboutincreasing unevendevelopment imply,\\nit varies also in nature.And this variation reflects the plurality of\\nways in whichtherelations ofproduction canbeorganised\\nspatially. Finally, inturn, this way of conceptualising geographical\\ninequality enablesthereformulation ofsome \\'spatial\\' issues at\\npresenton thepolitical agenda.\\nBeforepursuing thisargument, it isimportant to look at one or\\ntwootheraspectsofthesespatialstructures .\\nSome issues\\nTheconcern ofthisbookiswithintranational geographical\\ndifferentiation ,butthisconcern cannotbedivorced fromits\\ninternational context. Acountry\\'sinternal economic geography\\nreflects its place in the international politicaleconomy, theinterna\\xad\\ntionaldivisionoflabour.Itis well recognised thatcountries on the\\nreceiving end ofimperialism , as it were, reflect in their internal\\nspatialstructure theirsubordinate andexternally orientated posi\\xad\\ntion within the world economy. The same applies to metropolitan\\ncountries.Thegeography of\\'Britain the dominant imperialist and\\ntradingpower\\'wasstructured bybooming ,export-based industries\\non the one handand asinkingagriculture on theother.A well\\xad\\nknownattempttopointto possible future developments inFrench\\nregionalgeography startedbytakinganumberofdifferent possible\\nscenarios for theinternational roleofthatcountry as a whole\\n(Michon-Savarit , 1975).\\nIntranational spatialstructures areembedded in aninternational\\nsystem.Itmay bethattheeconomies ofdifferent partsofthe world\\nare \\'specialise d\\'in theproduction ofdifferent commod ities.\\nIncreasingly today,on theotherhand, manyoftheindustries\\nwhich are organised alongpart-process lines, for instance, are\\ninternationalised in terms oftheirproduction facilities. Different\\nnationaleconomies willhave different balancesofthevariousstages\\nofproduction andtheirinternal geography will be affected\\naccordingly .\\nTheelectronics industry is a case in point.TheUnitedKingdom\\noccupies anintermediate position in theinternational spatial\\nstructure ofthisindustry. It is both a location forinwarddirect\\ninvestment in the lower ordersof thepart-process hierarchy , and the\\nsourceofoutward directinvestment. In this it is different from, say, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 81\\nThirdWorldcountries, which tend to have only inwarddirect\\ninvestment, littleownership in theseindustries by localcapital,and\\nconsequently no presence oftheuppertiersofthemanagement\\nhierarchy, andlittle in the upperechelons ofthepart-process\\nstructure either. The inwardinvestment in theUnitedKingdom,\\nmuchofit from the United States but more recently including also\\nfacilities owned by German andJapanese companies, tends to be\\n\\'headless\\', to be lacking the top end of bothmanagement and\\nproduction hierarchies . Even if development (the\\'0\\'ofR andD)\\niscarriedon in the United Kingdom, very often the basic research is\\nnot (Scott, 1974).This, then, tends to give addedweight to the\\nproduction - assembly locations ratherthanto the sites of control\\nandinnovation .Theoutward investment tends to be more balanced .\\nAnumberofBritish owned companies do farm outsome -though\\nnot all- of their humdrum operations tocountries with lower wages\\nthanthose offered in the UnitedKingdom . But there is also some\\ntendency to carryoutadvanced research in the UnitedStates. The\\nState-owned Inmoshasoptedfor thisstrategy, and aconsiderable\\nfractionofthehigh-technology investment in the early years of\\nSilicon Valley was owned by British capital.The net result ofthis\\ncomplex relationto theinternational sectoraldivisionoflabouris\\nprobably thatthespatialstructure established in theUnitedKing\\xad\\ndom, while clearly representative ofall stages ofproduction (in\\ncontrasttothatinaThirdWorldcountry) isunder-represented at the\\ntop endofthehierarchy .ThusthepositionoftheUnitedKingdom in\\nthe overall world capitalist economy is reflected in the geographical\\nstructure andbalanceofthisindustry within the country.\\nThe basic chemicals industry is alsoorganised at aninternational\\nleveland once again each national spatialpatternispartand parcel\\nof aninternational division oflabour.Thenational geography\\ncannotbeunderstood atnational level alone. In chemicals this is a\\nfairlycomplicated phenomenon, but a few pointsare clear. The\\nnon-Rand 0production inFigure3.4 isthatofthe huge chemical\\ncomplexes typical ofthemetropolitan countries where, as we have\\nseen, each ofthemajorstages from refining and the production of\\nbasicproducts through to the main derivatives will usually take\\nplace.Theremay also be a second tier oforganisation linking\\nproduction anddistribution across a numberofdifferent countries .\\nSuch anorganisation exists within the EC, for example, and ismade\\npossible by the vast size oftheindividual companies. Thereis thus\\nlittle by way ofahierarchy - in the sense of a differentiation 82Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbetween sites ofproduction whichcouldform the basis for\\ninequality - either within each of these metropolitan countries or\\nbetween them. Things are different, however, in the division of\\nlabourwhichexists between these countries as agroupand many of\\ntheThirdWorldproducer countries. The latterhave for long often\\nhad little otherthan raw-material production itself. In contrast to\\nthe electronics case this international hierarchy is not a response to\\nvariations in the cost and type of labour. Above all it is a response\\nto the location of raw materials on the one hand and to political\\nrelations between the companies andStates,and between the\\ndifferent States, on the other. Fear of nationalisation of a set of\\nproducts seen as\\'strategic\\' and requiring high levels ofcapital\\ninvestment in their production figureslargely.There is,of course, as\\na result ofdistinct political strategies, considerable variation\\nbetween countries (Laurencin et al..1977), but broadly speaking\\naninternational divisionoflabourat present exists in which most\\nof the physical and economic conditions foraccumulation are\\nconfined tometropolitan countries, andmanyThirdWorld\\nproducer countries lack even the production ofa rangeofbasic\\nproducts.\\n* * *This brings us back to anotherissue. The evolution ofdifferent\\nkindsofspatialstructure, theirestablishment, maintenance and\\neventual col1apse and change, are not simply determined by the\\ncharacteristics ofthelabourprocess, the requirements of accumula\\xad\\ntion, the stages of the mode ofproduction, or even the demands of\\ncapital. None ofthese things in themselves \\'resultin\\' specificspatial\\nforms. Spatial structures are established, reinforced, combated and\\nchanged throughpolitical and economic strategies and battles on\\nthepartofmanagers, workers and political representatives . The\\npresently dominant international divisionoflabourinpetrochem\\xad\\nicalsis now subject to political, backed up by economic, pressure. It\\nisthe object of political struggle.And the outcome willbe the result,\\nnot only of technological and economic requirements and con\\xad\\nstraints, but also of a multi-sided political and economic battle\\nbetween the politics of ThirdWorldproducer countries, interna\\xad\\ntional companies in the sector, and metropolitan State strategies\\n(Laurencin et al.,1977).This isclear at the international level,but it\\nis true also within individual countries.\\nSome of the best examples ofthis can be seen in the conflicts in\\nthe carindustry in recent decades. Many ofthese conflicts have Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 83\\nbeenprecisely overwhatkindofspatialstructure wouldbe\\nestablished . Onedimension ofthetechnical divisionoflabourin\\nthisindustry wasillustrated inFigure3.4.Carproduction consists\\ntechnically ofthemanufacture ofa largenumberofcomponent\\nparts(engines, gearboxes, suspension units,axles) which are then\\nassembled .\\'Thisisrepresented inFigure3.4butwithout any\\nspatialconnotations. Thequestion ishowthisstructure of\\nproduction relations, in terms ofbothownership andtechnology,\\nis to be combined with the form ofspatialdifferentiation which\\nfaces it. Thiscan beboththeobjectandthe result ofconflict.\\nSpatialseparation andvariation have been, in the carindustry, as\\nmuch a partofcapital\\'s strategy againstlabouras have changes\\nwithinproduction . Twocontrasting examples makethis clear. Fiat\\nin Italy, on the one hand,and the companies operating in the\\nUnitedKingdom on theother,havebothattempted toestablish\\nintranational, hierarchical, spatialstructures.\\nFromthe early I970s, andindeedinitiallyfollowing anagreement\\nwith the unionsin 1969, Fiatbegan to restructure itsgeographical\\npatternofproduction within Italy. It was a changewhich was itself\\nallied to a more general realignment ofFiat\\'sposition within the\\nsystemofcarproduction . Oneelementofthatspatialreorganisa\\xad\\ntion was the decentralisation ofpartofthecompany\\'s production\\naway from its traditional base inTurin,to thesouthofItaly. This\\ngeographical shift inturnentailedan explicit processofsegmenta \\xad\\ntionofthe stages ofproduction sothatsomeofthemcouldbe\\nseparated offin adifferent region.Production change and\\ngeographical changewereplanned together. Thepartsofproduc\\xad\\ntion which were decentralised to thesouthweredifferent fromthose\\nremaining in thenorth(Courlet, 1977;Deaglio, 1975).Aboveall,\\nwhatwentsouthwasassembly work,alongwithotherfactories\\nproviding supplies andcertainkindsofsubassemblies andparts.\\nWhatwasestablished, therefore, was apart-process, hierarchical,\\nspatialstructure, with the southat thebottomofthehierarchy .\\nJobstherewereprimarily low-paid anddefined aslow-skilled\\n(Courlet, 1977, p. 273; Deaglio, 1975).Theinterregional difference\\ninproduction jobswasreinforced by the fact thatnoneofthe\\nhighermanagerial, financial andservicefunctions leftTurin.\\nThe new spatialstructure wasfounded oninequalities already\\naccepted within the workforce on the basis ofthetechnical division\\noflabour(thatassembly workerswere classified as less skilled, were\\nless well paid,etc.)andupongeographical differences in the 84SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nworkforce whichenabledevengreaterdisparities to be enforced.\\nTheworkersofTurinwere relatively strongand well organised, and\\ntheir increased militancy is cited by some (Courlet, p. 7) as being a\\nfactorbehind the new locational strategy. Incontrast, theworkers\\nofthesouthwere new to modernindustry and had little experience\\nofunionorganisation. Thesecharacteristics in themselves, however,\\nwere not enough. Therehad been attempts byItalianindustry to\\nusesoutherners before. We saw in Chapter 2thata few years\\nearlier, in the Italy of the fifties and early sixties, southerners had\\nbeendraftedinto theworking classthroughmigration tojobsin the\\nbooming industrial north.\\nIn this earlier period Italianindustry wantedsouthern workers\\nbothbecause, as wehave seen, this was a period of extensive growth\\nand also because in some cases, including Fiat,newlabourwas\\nbeingsoughtto work new machinery . Technical changeand a\\nchangein theworkforce wereimplemented together (Partridge,\\n1980).Fiatran anadvertising campaign in thesouthto entice\\nworkers north,workers who, largely from a poorpeasantback\\xad\\nground,management hopedwould put up with the job\\'sincreased\\nmonotony .Fora while the strategy worked, backedup by\\nencouragement to racism against\\'theMeridionale\\' as a means of\\ndividing the workforce .\\'Inthisperiodtherewasn\\'teven one\\nsouthern foreman - thesoutherners weretreatedas puremachine\\nfodderwithabsolutely no chance ofpromotion\\' (Partridge, 1980,\\np.423).\\nBut it was not to last. We saw earlier thatthe newly arrived\\nindustrial workforce was often in the vanguard ofthe wave of\\nmilitancy at the turnofthe decade. In partit had a lot to do with\\n\\'place\\'. The southerners had come northwith promises ofhigh\\nwages and high standards ofliving. They found themselves caught\\nin themargins of aspiralling urbanisation. They lived in hostels,\\npaidrentsthatate into the higher wages and discovered thatthose\\n\\'higherwagesdidn\\'tgo far with the higher prices ofthenorthand\\ntheaddedexpenses oflaundering andcatering thatyoung\\nunmarried immigrants had to face\\' (Partridge, p. 430).(Southern\\nmales were clearly used to relying on unpaidlabourfor food and\\nclean clothes!) In thatcombination ofindustrial andcommunity\\nconditions, ofwork-life and home-life, what had been a potential\\nweakness turnedtostrength. \\'Lackofindustrial experience\\' can\\nlead to indiscipline as well as to submission. \\'Butthesoutherners,\\nespecially, weren\\'treally used to discipline like the northerners ... Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 85\\nthey talked amongthemselves, sometimes they didn\\'t give a shit ...\\ntheydidn\\'tunderstand anything - but precisely becausetheydidn\\'t\\nunderstand the rules ofFiat,it was really they who began mass\\ndiscussions, who began to breakdiscipline...So Ithinkit was\\nreally the southerners atFiatwith their \"badmanners\"...who\\nstartedto discuss the problems\\' (Parlanti, undated, quotedin\\nPartridge).\\nIt was in the contextof this experience thatFiat\\'smovement\\nsouthbegan.Maybein adifferent geographical setting,home-based\\nin their own region, outof thecompany ofthestudents and the\\nothermanufacturing workers of theindustrial triangle, and with\\nlessstrength in thelabourmarket, southern workers would be\\ndifferent. Thespatialstrategy ofdispersion within the south,\\nmoreover, seemed designed to the same end, reinforcing through\\nisolationoflabourmarketsthe general characteristics ofthe region.\\nWhatFiathadmanaged to do was to combine particular aspectsof\\nthe technical division oflabourwithspatialdifferentiation in the\\nworkforce. Itmanaged toestablish aspatialstructure which was\\nhierarchised in terms bothofadministration andcontrolandof\\nstages and statuseswithinproduction and for a while at least it was\\nsuccessful.\\nBritishcapitalin theUnitedKingdom carindustry has not\\nsucceeded in achieving the same results. Until about1960the car\\nindustry inBritainwasoverwhelmingly concentrated inthewest\\nmidlands and the south-east ofEngland. In 1959, these areas\\naccounted for 72 per cent of totalUnitedKingdom employment\\nin theindustry (Keeble, 1976, p. 181). But in the early sixties this\\npatternchanged considerably with all the majorcar firms setting up\\nnew factories or large plantextensions in thedepressed areasofthe\\ncountry, primarily in Merseyside and in Scotland . In 1959 the\\ndepressed regions - the northofEngland, Wales, Scotland and the\\nnorth-west ofEngland - had only 11.8per centofworkers in the\\ncarindustry in the United Kingdom ; by 1968they had22.4per cent\\n(Friedman ,1977,p.243).The basic reasons for this decentralisation\\nofproduction activity are fairly generally agreed, regional policy\\nandgovernment pressure rankingfirst, but combined with avail\\xad\\nabilityofunemployed male workers (see, for instance, Friedman,\\n1977,p.221;Keeble, 1976,pp.186-7).Whatever the precise\\nbalanceofthese two factors, the factofdecentralisation created\\nthepossibility ofestablishing conditions ofproduction more\\nfavourable tocapitalthanthosewhichexistedin theolder- 86 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nestablished locations. The car workers ofthe west midlands, as we\\nhave seen, were strongly organised and had won for themselves\\ngood rates ofpay and favourable skill ratings (Beynon, 1973,p. 65;\\nFriedman, 1977,pp. 221-4). This local strengthwas aninheritance\\nofdecades and of the long-established importance of engineering in\\nthe west midlands region. One strategy for the car companies was\\nclearly to undermine this strengthsimply by changing location, by\\nmoving outside the geographical reach of this levelof organisation.\\nThe workers in the new areas faced bleak prospects as a result of\\njoblossesin the industries previously dominating those regions, and\\nit wasclearly possible thatsuch gloomy conditions would produce a\\nvulnerable workforce. Certainly anattemptwas made to play upon\\nthese disparities, though to different degrees in the different firms.\\nWages in Ford\\'sandVauxhall\\'s large new factories were quickly\\nbroughtinto line with those in their older factories in the south\\xad\\neast. But Rootes, BMC and Leyland continued to pay far lower\\nrates than in their midlands factories. The difference in approach\\namong the firms reflected wide pay differences between midlands\\nfactories (especially those in Coventry) and those ofthesouth-east\\n(Friedman, 1977,p. 221).6\\nTheattempt toimpose different conditions onworkers in\\ndifferent regions did not confine itself to pay. Friedman points\\noutthatmanagers hoped the \\'vulnerable\\' workers in the new plants\\nmight be \\'moreamenable to managerial initiatives\\' (p. 243),and he\\nquotesChrysler\\'s attemptto initiate Measured Day Work at its\\nLinwood plantinScotland. Theimportance ofthis aspect of\\ncontrolover the workforce, as well as the more obvious money\\ndifferentials, isalso stressed by Beynon (1973)in his examination of\\ntheestablishment ofFord\\'sHalewood factory. Quotingmanagerial\\ndirectives, he pointsoutthatexpansion away from traditional areas\\nmade it possible for the car companies to organise production free\\nof the job controlthathad built up in the old factories:\\'when Ford\\ncame to Liverpool \"restrictive practices\", the activities of shop\\nstewards andmanagerial prerogatives dominated the minds of\\nmanagement and supervision\\' (p. 65). Management and foremen\\nin the new plantwere recruited from Dagenham . Mostofthe\\nlabour,on theotherhand, was \\'green\\' and recruited locally. \\'Many\\nofthemanagement team had been involved in conflicts with\\nsteward organisation atDagenham andweredetermined to\\npreventa similar situation developing at Halewood\\' (Beynon,\\np.65). Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 87\\nThe strategy, however, did not work. Those employed in the new\\nfactories resisted the imposition ofsuch differentials. Fromthe mid\\xad\\nsixtieson, disputes demanding parity between factories, both within\\nand betweencompanies, began to replace disputes over differentials\\nwithin factories as the majorsource of wage grievance in the\\nindustry. A series ofmajor parity strikes in the late sixtiesand early\\nseventiesbegan with a six weeklong dispute in 1966involving 4000\\nworkers at Leyland\\'s Bathgate factory in Scotland over parity with\\nitsStandard-Triumph factory in Coventry. \\'Coventry \\'s high wages,\\nmade more visible because ofthe Coventry Toolroom Agreement,\\nwere held up to employers as a standard for the whole industry in\\nBritain . . . the strategy ofbuilding a periphery ofworkers within\\ncar firms in this country, separated fromCoventry andother\\ntraditional motorareas, began to crumble duringthe late I960s\\'\\n(Friedman, 1977,pp. 221-4).7\\nSimilar battles took place over attempts to establish differentials\\ninshop-floor organisation. At Halewood the policy failed, stimulat\\xad\\ninginsteadmuchconflict. \\'By 1964 a strongshopstewards\\ncommittee had been established in each ofthe three plants on the\\nHalewood estate, and the company had been forced to amend its\\npolicyofrestriction\\' (Beynon, pp. 66-7).\\nTheestablishment ofa spatialstructure, then, isnot justamatter\\nof a simple calculation on the partofcapital. Its success or failure\\ncanbea function also ofworkers\\' ownattitudes and strategies, in\\nthis case their determined resistance. \\'The requirements of capital\\'\\ndo not always have it their own way.\\nThere were also interesting differences between the British and\\nItalian cases. Most importantly, perhaps, in the United Kingdom\\nthe technical division oflabourwas not so clearly co-ordinated with\\nskill difference and spatial separation as itappearsto have been in\\nthe case of Fiat. Both were part-process spatialstructures, but in\\nthe Britishcasethere wasa lesssystematic and clear-cut hierarchical\\nrelationship between technical division oflabourand geography.\\nHalewood and Ellesmere Portincluded majorassembly plants, but\\nthen, as we have seen, Fordand Vauxhall did not succeed in the\\nstrategyofwage-differentials for very long. Certainly it has not\\nbeen the case thatonly lessskilledjobs have gone to peripheral-area\\nlocations. Without thatbasisofdivision, therefore, the way was\\nopen for worker resistance on the basis ofdirect parity claims,\\nbased on identical work, and management\\'s strategy of paying\\nlower wages was, therefore, dependent entirely on the workers in 88SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe new areas being more vulnerable than those in the old. It\\ndepended, inother.words, on management\\'s assessment simply of\\ngeographical differences within the labourforce,ofitsgreater\\nstrength in relation to labourin the depressed areas and on a lack\\nofsolidarity between regions. It was a division based on location\\nratherthanrace, sex or skill (Friedman, 1977,p. 221). It depended\\nentirely upon geographical differences in the strength of otherwise\\nsimilar workers.\\nBut neither were the geographical disparities in the labourforce\\nthe same in the two countries .They were undoubtedly moremarked\\nin Italy, where the contrast was between the organised workers of\\ntheindustrial northand people being draftedin from a rural\\npeasantsociety in the Mezzogiorno. The distance from Turinto\\nNaples is far greater thanthatfromCoventry to Merseyside, not\\njustin terms of kilometres or miles but also in terms of social\\nrelations.\\nThe workers who were recruited on Merseyside and in Scotland\\nwere not green workers in the same way as those of southern Italy.\\nThey may have been vulnerable to thethreatofunemployment, but\\nthey were not without experience of organisation . This was a\\nworking-class area and some of the new recruits had been union\\nworkers. Few, however, had been activists, and Ford\\'srecruitment\\npolicy was designed to keep things thatway. Given the employment\\nconditions elsewhere in the area \\'everybody wanted to go to Ford\\'s\\nbut not everybody was allowed in. Ford\\'shad the pick ofthelabour\\nmarket, and the Company followed a recruitment policy...\\nconsistent with . . . obtaining atrouble-free planton Merseyside\\n...Family men with commitments came first. Stable men who were\\ntied down with debt and responsibility were given priority. Men\\nundertwenty were formally barredand there was little welcome in\\nHalewood for men off the dock or the buildings. Seamen weren\\'t\\nvery high up the list either. Neitherwere the unemployed\\' (Beynon,\\np. 89). Vauxhall at Ellesmere Port operated a\\'pointssystem\\' for\\nrecruitment , based on similar criteria (lWCMotorsGroup,1978,\\np. 11). The aim, in otherwords, was to overcome the potential\\nmilitancy of theworkforce and to reinforce its \\'geographical\\'\\nvulnerability . Beynon reportsa steward recollecting thatit was\\n\\'nota typical Merseyside labourforce at all\\' (p. 89). But it was still\\nin, andpartof, Merseyside.

By the late sixties the\\ncar workers ofScotland and of Merseyside were amongthe best\\norganised and most militantin theUnitedKingdom .\\nCompared with the Italiancase, then, in Britain not only was the\\nattempt at divisiveness more dependent simply on specifically\\ngeographical differences inlabour\\'s strength, butalsothose\\ndifferences, in spite ofmanagerial efforts to reinforce them, were\\nthemselves less marked. Bothmanagement strategy inrelationto\\ngeography , andgeography itself, were different.\\nSuch things are influential , but they are not determinant.It still\\ntook aconscious effortoforganisation (Wright\\'s organisational as\\nopposed tostructural capacities) to buildstrength in the car plants\\nof theperipheral regionsofBritain. And in the factories ofsouthern\\nItaly such effort has eventually been able to overcome thestructural\\ndifficulties and to establish a reputation fororganisational strength.\\nIn the British case certainly, and increasingly in the Italian,\\nlocational separation and thehoped-for effectsofdifferences in the\\nsituation ofworkers, proved to be an insufficient basis on which to\\nestablish furtherdifferences, in wagesand conditions, between those\\nworkers. In the British case it was a locational strategybothwithin\\na singlecountryand between areas all ofwhich had a long history\\nofunionisation, even if not in thatparticular sectorofindustry. In\\nthe years since the failure ofthatattemptwithin one country, many\\nmajorcar firms havemanaged toestablish such differences but on\\naninternational scale,bothbetween metropolitan andperipheral\\nEuropeand between Europeas a whole and the countries ofSouth\\nAmerica and the FarEast. The plantsestablished in the British\\nDevelopment Areas in the sixties operated in acontextwhere there\\nwas essentially a United Kingdom carmarket,with therelationship\\nto the world production andmarketsystemoperating primarily\\nthrough exportsandthrough United States ownership ofgroups\\nwhichoperated asseparate entities. Therewas some degree of\\nmanagerial subordination but little in the way ofaninternational\\npart-process structure . But by the seventies themultinational\\nproducers were well on theirway to establishing atechnical\\ndivisionoflabouratinternational level.Imports to Britain rose\\nsharply, but a sizeable proportion ofthe increase was due to\\nimports byUS/UK manufacturers themselves. In 1982 Ford\\nimported morethanitexported from the United Kingdom\\n(Gooding, 1982). It was a reflection not justofincreasing trade, 90SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nbutoftheestablishment atinternational levelofaspatialstructure\\nwhichincluded thegeographical separation ofdifferent stagesof\\nproduction .Thenextroundofcarplantsin theDevelopment\\nAreas, such as Ford\\'s engine plantat Bridgend, were part-process\\nplantsbutnot for assembly, and they were sited on the basis ofan\\ninternational choiceoflocations .

Once againthenational patternmust be analysed in an\\ninternational context. And inthatwidercontextthe difficulties of\\norganising battlesoverparityare fargreater.Onceagain,geogra\\xad\\nphymatters.\\nAnexample\\nThedevelopment ofthefootwear industry in theUnitedKingdom\\nover the last 200 years illustrates anumberofthese themes. Up to\\nthebeginning ofthenineteenth centurytheindustry was largely\\nconcentrated inLondon. Butaroundthattime rising labourcosts\\nandincreasing militancy amongworkers stimulated amajor\\ngeographical shift.Foster(1974) writes of\\'theeffortsofthegreat\\nLondon contractors (forlong the -controlling powerwithinthe\\nindustry) to sidestep the effects ofwartime wageinflation\\' (p. 85).\\nIn cost terms the contractors were being pressured onbothsides.\\nFormarkets, they relied mainly on exportordersand fixed-price\\npurchasing fromtheArmyandNavy.Theywere,therefore,\\nparticularly vulnerable to rising labourcosts.Thewayoutwhich\\nthey chose was to divertmoreandmoreoftheirordersfrom\\nLondon to thesecondary, provincial centresofproduction in the\\nnorthand,especially, the midlands. Thecrucialdifferences between\\nLondon andtheprovinces lay in the costoflabourandthe\\norganisation oftheworkforces. Theprovincial centres\\'offered\\nnotjustcheapersubsistence but alabourforcethatwasunorga\\xad\\nnised\\'(Foster,p. 85).Theshift in the geographical centreofgravity\\noftheindustry resulted fromwhatFostercalls\\'thisblacklegging\\ndiversion ofwork from London\\' (p. 86).Conversely ,geographical\\nmobility enabledaccumulation tocontinue.\\nNorthampton was one ofthe main centreschosenfor this\\nexpansion .Therewere anumberofreasonsfor this. Therewas, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 91\\nforinstance, aneasily-available supplyofleatherfrom the\\nsurrounding agricultural area. But, as Fosterindicated, perhaps\\nthe most important considerations had to do with labour.The\\nlabourforce here was abundant and it was cheap. Forthe social\\nrelations in agriculture in this area were changing, and this ensured\\naconstant streamoflandless, workless people. The east midlands\\nwas a region where the establishment oflarge-scale commercial\\nfarming came ratherlate, incomparison with the rest ofEngland.\\n\\'In most partsof the region the open field system ofagriculture\\npersisted for a long time - as long as anywhere in England \\xad\\nenclosure not being completed until the early nineteenth century,\\nandcompact villages and well-knit village communities remained\\ntypical\\'(Dury, 1963,p. 363). This was, then, justthe period when,\\nin thispartof England, labourwas being thrownofTthe land and\\nwas therefore abundant. Itwas also cheap, partlybecause of its very\\nabundance and partly, Fostersuggests, because it was \\'probably\\nopen to covert subsidy from the poorrates\\'(p. 85).\\nBut theattraction ofNorthampton was not simply thatlabour\\nwasavailable. but also that labourwas, incontrastto the workers in\\nLondon, completely unorganised into any form ofunion. In part\\nthis was because most of the workers were new to the industry. But\\nalso the fact thatthere was a constant streamofthis surplus labour\\ncoming in from the rural areas to Northampton itself and to the\\nvillages made it likely that the workforce ofthe newly-established\\nfootwear industry would remainunorganised .Northampton did not\\nhaveanything approaching alabourmovement. Itwas not for want\\nof trying. There were a numberofattempts toorganise unions but\\non each occasion it was possible to attractonly a small numberof\\nworkers for any length oftime and \\'fromthe 1830s to the 1850s\\nevery singlestrike in the shoe-making industryseems to have ended\\nindisaster\\'(Foster, p. 102).As Fosterpoints out \\'Giventhenature\\nof the local economy, this of course is justwhat one would expect.\\nThe whole patternofNorthampton\\'s growthdepended on the\\ncheapness of its labour,its lack of militancy and the constant influx\\nof new workers from the surrounding countryside\\' (p.102). He\\nquotes a union organiser, speaking in 1834,early on in this struggle\\nto build a labourmovement. \\'There is no class ofbeing in\\nChristendom thatmore requires the aid of a well-conducted and\\nproperly regulated union than the operative cordwainers of the\\ncounty; they having long been reduced to the lowest stage of\\npoverty, privation and want and far sunk in the black night of 92SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nignorance....\\'(quoted on p. 102). Sixteen years later, by the\\nmiddle of the century, thesituation was much the same. The\\ncontinued influxofpeopledesperate forworkmadeunion\\norganising virtually impossible. According to ajournalist ofthe\\nMorning Chronicle: \\'Thesociety [of shoemakers] hasendeavoured\\nfor some years to keep up the price oflabour,but all their efforts\\nhave been ineffectual. \"Twoorthreeyearssince,\"saidthe\\nsecretary, \"westruckin one of the shops in the town. It was no\\nuseourholdingout for the scabs from the countrywent in and\\nfetched the work for whatever price the mastersliked to give\"\\n(quoted inFoster,p. 103). Indeed, by this time, insteadof\\nfunctioning in the main to improve the pay and conditions of\\nworkersin its own area,as might be expected in a locality where the\\nindustry had now been well established for some decades, the\\nNorthampton shoemakers\\' societyoperated mainly as a tramping\\norganisation which helped its members find work in otherpartsof\\nthe country! \\'Inall this the rootproblem was clearly a labour\\nmarketthatstretched far beyond the town itself and included (as a\\nresultofthe rural clearances) a pauperized massoflabourwilling to\\ndoalmostanything to getwork\\'(Foster,1974, p. 103).\\nNow, as the industry established itself in the Northamptonshire\\narea, ittookon aparticular spatialstructure, and this too, like the\\nweakness ofthelabourforce, was a direct function ofexisting,\\nwider social relations.Itwasduringthemid-nineteenth centurythat\\noneimportant aspectoftheorganisation ofproduction in the\\nindustry wasestablished which has remained ever since and which\\nhas affected both labour-movement organisation andlocational\\nstrategy. A system developed whereby men were employed direct by\\ncapital,on a factory basis in the town or village, to make shoes.\\nVery frequently, however, the men would in turn farm outto\\nwomen the \\'closing\\' process - stitching the uppers on to the soles.\\nThe women were subcontracted labourandworked athome,\\nmainlybasedin the\\'compact villages andwell-knit village\\ncommunities\\' whichDuryreferred to as still being so important\\nin the area around Northampton. Withintheindustry a sexual\\ndivisionoflabourthus developed which reflected social divisions in\\nthe world outside- and in particular theconfinement ofwomen to\\nthe home. New relations ofproduction, a sexual division oflabour,\\nandalocalinternal spatialstructure werethusestablished\\nsimultaneously. UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 93\\nLater in the nineteenth century, however, pressure fromimports\\nincreased and capitalin theindustry wasagainfaced with the need\\nto cut costs. \\'Onceagain,therefore, with no help from machinery,\\nand with wages alreadydown to subsistence level,some furtherway\\nhad to be found ofmaintaining profitability\\' (Foster, p. 86). The\\nsolutionadopted this time was to changethe social relations within\\ntheindustry and, aspartand parcel ofthis, once more to alterits\\nspatialstructure . Themajorshift was a massive expansion in the\\ndirectemployment bycapitalofwomen and children infactories in\\nthe town ofNorthampton itself. By the middle of the centuryover\\nhalfthewage-labour forceoftheindustry in theareaconsisted of\\nwomen and children. \\'Thelarger social importance ofthis was not\\nso much their employment itself (they had to some extent been\\nemployed at home before) as the fact thatthey were now employed\\ntogether, undersupervision , in the town centreworkshops\\' (Foster,\\np. 86). This shift in boththe social and the spatialorganisation of\\ntheindustry had afurthergeographical consequence. Along with\\ntheincreasing severity of the poorlaws itencouraged a mass influx\\nofimmigrants, this time from the surrounding villages to the town\\nitself. \\'Where previously shoemaking families had been able to work\\nwithout difficulty in quite distantvillages, they now had to be\\nwithin daily reach of the town\\'sclosingshops\\'(Foster,p. 86). The\\nby-now established sexualdivision oflabourin theindustry,\\ncombined with the fact that women continued to beresponsible\\nfordomestic labourin the home and therefore were unable to travel\\nfar to work outsidethe home, meantthatachangein the social\\nrelations inproduction (the establishment ofthe closing process on\\na factory basis) had considerable geographical implications. The\\nchanging organisation ofproduction and the stubbornly unchan\\xad\\ngingrelations between the sexes together accelerated the process of\\nurbanisation in thenineteenth-century eastmidlands ofEngland.\\nBy1851Northampton\\'s population had reached 26,000 and almost\\none in two ofits families were dependent on the shoe industry.\\nInside the production process theprevious division between\\nfactory and domestic (closing) organisation wasformalised as two\\nseparate stages of production ,performed bydifferent groupswithin\\ntheworkforce , butbothnowoperated on afactorybasis.Labour\\ncosts were reduced at this stage, not by a changein the kind of\\nlabourwhich was used, nor by a change in production technique\\n(for the work ofclosing the shoe remained exactly as it had been 94 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nwhenperformed in the women\\'s own homes) but by a change in\\nproduction relations. This enabled the more direct enforcement of\\ndiscipline over the actualwork process: controlover the time,\\namountand pace ofwork for each individual worker. This change\\neventhoughit was confined to something asapparently intangible\\nas \\'social relations\\' intumhadmajorand immediate implications\\nfor the spatial organisation ofproduction in the industry.\\nBut while production relations and social structure underwent\\nmajorchanges, the sexual division oflabour,established initially\\nbecauseof\\'theplace of women in the home\\', became more firmly\\ninscribed in the organisation oftheindustry. From now on, men\\ndidcutting(clicking), women did closing (see also Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982).It was a social allocation ofdifferent kinds of\\nworkers to different stages in the process of production, and along\\nlines of division accepted within and by the workforce, which was\\nbased on a sexual division oflabourin the wider society, and taken\\nup and thereby reinforced within production .Itwas to have further\\nimplications for the spatial structure oftheindustry.\\nFirst of all, it played an important role in the course oflabour\\nrelations within the industry. The level of labourmilitancy in the\\nfootwear industry hasremained low. The two mainunions\\n(NUFLAT and the Rossendale Union) are seen by the employers\\nthemselves as moderate andaccommodating . Areportby the\\nEconomists Advisory Group(undated) commented that\\'workers\\nin theindustryareorganised into two industrial unionsratherthan\\non a craft basis. EAG believes thatthis ismost satisfactory and is a\\npartialexplanation ofthe generally good industrial relations in the\\nindustry....We consider thatthe present union leadership is\\nawarethatbadindustrial relations could cripple the footwear\\nindustryat a time when it is already vulnerable\\' (p. 133).\\'Evidence\\nof the fairly moderate attitudeof the unions at local level\\' is then\\ndetailed. The importance ofthis union amenability was revealed\\nwhen employers readily agreed to a closed shop in the industry.The\\nquid pro quo for this seems to have been twofold. First, it was a\\ndeterrent to theunions\\'being taken over by a more general union,\\nwhich might be more militant: \\'The introduction of the closed shop\\ninMarchthis year will significantly increase the two unions\\'\\nmembership and funds . . . . This strengthening ofthe unions is\\ndesirable to the extent thatit makes them less vulnerable to take\\nover by some otherunion. We doubtwhetherofitself it will make\\nmuch change in relations within the industry\\' (Economists Advisory Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 95\\nGroup,undated, p. 133).Second, the sexual division oflabourwas\\nretained: \\'We are unaware ofany restrictive practice in the industry\\nsave two which are so glaringasapparently not even to be\\ndescribed as such by managers in theindustry; therestriction of\\nclicking to men and ofclosing to women. We do not accept that\\nthere is any aspect ofeitheroperation which precludes the use of\\neithersex. We doubtwhether thiscustom conforms to the\\nrequirements ofrecent sex discrimination legislation\\' (p. 134).It\\nstillcontinues to exist in practice, however.\\nThis sexual division oflabourstill has effects on the geography of\\ntheindustry. Muchofthefootwear industry in the United Kingdom\\ntoday is located in the small towns and villages ofregions such as\\nthe eastmidlands and East Anglia. But these are regions to which,\\nsince the Second World War, otherfemale-employing industries\\nhave begun to decentralise. This has meant competition forlabour\\nand pressure on wages. Women\\'s wages in the industry have been\\npushed up. Such changes have not been takingplace in the market\\nfor male labour(though inabsolute terms men\\'s wages remain\\nhigher than women\\'s). This differential availability (at those wages)\\nofmale and female labourhas led to an increasing degree of\\ngeographical separation between the two stages ofproduction: a\\nnew spatial structure. TheEconomists Advisory Groupreportsthat\\ntheshortageofclosers (women) has necessitated the establishment\\nofclosingroomsawayfromthemainfactory (p. 134). In other\\nwords,a social division ofjobsbetween workers, which has\\nabsolutely no technical basis in the present form of organisation\\noftheindustry, continues to influence its spatialstructure . It is a\\nstory we shall take up again in Chapter 4.\\nIn thefootwear industry in Britain today, then, it is not justthat\\nthere isa variation in the balance ofemployment between men and\\nwomen in different areas. Divisions which have been established\\nwithin the organisation ofthe process ofproduction itself have been\\na necessary precondition for these variations in thegeographical\\npatternofemployment. Butneitherhas it been true thatthe\\ntechnical division oflabouritself, or the natureofthelabour\\nprocesses within the industry, have been the determinant ofthe kind\\noflaboursoughtbycompanies in theindustry. Theallocation of\\ndifferent groupsofpeople to different jobshas had more to do with\\nsocial and ideological structures established outsidethe factory than\\nwith any requirements of thelabourprocess itself. And \\'place\\' has\\nbeenimportant in the history oftheindustry too. The spatial 96SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nseparation ofhome and work reinforced the initial sexual-social\\ndivisionoflabourwithinproduction . The wider characteristics of\\ntheregionand its\\' social organisation , and in particular the\\nnineteenth-century changes in agriculture , have left their markon\\nunionorganisation within the industry. Such were the problems\\nposed by the continual influx of new workers that,to refer back to\\nWright\\'s terminology , theorganisational attempts made within the\\nindustry were powerless in the face ofthe lack ofstructural\\ncapacities, inthiscaselargelytheproduct ofthekindof\\ngeographical area in which the industry was located. The relation\\nbetween the technology ofproduction , social conflicts and defini\\xad\\ntionswithinandoutside thefactory, andgeographical form\\ncontinues to be one ofmutualinteraction and determination.\\n3.3Spatialstructures of production and geographical inequality\\nNot two-dimensional patterns, but underlying relations\\nThegeographical organisation ofproduction can, then, be con\\xad\\nceptualised in terms of the spatialstructure oftherelations of\\nproduction . And if this is so then what are often referred to as\\n\\'interregional relations\\' are also a reflection of the spatialstructure\\noftherelations ofproduction . Thenotionof\\'spatialrelations\\', in\\nthis sense, refers to the fact thatone function in the organisation of\\nproduction isoperating between two different places. While other\\nfunctions operatein a single location it is at this pointwithin the\\ndivision of labourthatspatialseparation iscombined with the\\naspatialdivision of tasks. Different regions have allottedto them, in\\ndifferent spatialstructures, particular bundlesoffunctions within\\nthe overall relations ofproduction .Itis what is often referred to as\\n\\'theroleofthe region\\' in the countryas a whole.\" And this in turn\\nmeansthatthegeography ofdominance andsubordination can take\\nmany forms. Fordifferent spatialstructures -different waysof\\norganising therelationsofproduction over space - can then be seen\\nto imply very different kinds of \\'interregional relations\\' .Different\\nwaysoforganising capitalist production underlie, and lead to,\\ndifferent kindsof\\'regional problem\\' .\\n* * *Thespatialstructure characterised by thelocational concentration\\nofownership andproduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 97\\nany sortofinterregional relations ofdominance andsubordination.\\nThetotalspanoffunctions ofrealownership and possession and\\nthe full range of production activities underanyindividual owner\\xad\\nship are present within each region. All \\'planned\\' relations, thoseof\\ndirectcontrolwithin a firm, are intraregional. And allinterregional\\nrelations consist of \\'unplanned\\' markettransactions between firms\\nor between firms,and consumers. It is,moreover, at least in some\\nlogical sense possible for every region to have exactly the same\\nmixture and spreadoflocally-owned production . This logical sense,\\nhowever, is one which considers only the formal range ofpossible\\npatterns, ratherthan the mechanisms of their production. Such\\nidyllic pictures ofbalance and equal exchange do not, ofcourse,\\nhave many historical referents. Historically, this form of spatial\\nstructure has been associated with specialisation anddifferentiation ,\\nand unequal marketrelations.\"\\nInparticular , in so far as this use ofspace has been associated\\nwith regional differences, it has most usually been one based on\\ninterregional relations structured aroundindustrial spatialconcen\\xad\\ntration.The role which any region plays within the larger system is\\nthus defined by its sectoral contribution orspecialisation . This was\\nthedominant situation ininterwar Britain, analysed by Carney,\\nLewis and Hudson(1977).Thereare anumberofways in which\\nsuchindustrial differentiation between regions can produce a\\nstructure ofinterregional subordination and/orinequality. Much\\nofthe history of capitalist societies so far has consisted ofthe\\nopening up, domination andsubsequent desertion ofareasby\\nparticular industries . The kind of dependence which can exist in\\nsuch cases is, ofcourse,structural (meaning sectoral) dependence \\xad\\n\\'over-representation\\' in theproduction ofparticular commodities\\nor ranges ofcommodities. Theemployment structure ofsuch areas\\nmay become heavily dependent on thefortunes ofparticular\\nindustries , and at any particular historical moment some will be\\nleading and otherslagging in the process ofeconomic growth. In\\ntermsofthis useofspace, it is sectoral concentration - the kind of\\ncommodities produced - which is likely to differentiate regions one\\nfromanother, and which defines their role within the overall\\nregional system.\\n* * *This form ofinterregional distinction does not characterise either\\nthe cloning or the part-process spatialstructures. In both these\\nlattercases all the regions in the system may have exactly the same 98SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nindustrial structure, andconversely anyindustry maybepresentin\\nall regions. Whatdistinguishes the regions in a case like this is their\\nrelationto a single unitofownership . Inboththese cases even an\\nequaldistribution ofindustries wiIIbeassociated withinequality,\\nwithinterregional relations ofdomination andsubordination. But\\nthereare also significant differences between these two spatial\\nstructures . Inboth,branchplantsaresubjecttoexternalownership\\nandcontrol,but in the part-process structure , where there is botha\\nmanagerial hierarchy andgeographical separation ofstagesof\\nproduction, regions\\'lowerdown\\'thehierarchy willbesubjectto\\nbothexternal ownership andproduction-dependence, andthe\\neffectsofthese two forms ofsubordination are very different.\\nTakefirst the case of the cloningspatialstructure . Here it is only\\ntherelations ofeconomic ownership andpossession which are\\ndisaggregated over space. In otherwords,theproduction activity\\xad\\nitself the same in all regions - is in the non-headquarters region\\nultimately subordinate toadministrative andfinancial control\\nlocatedoutsidethe region. Itis this which has cometobereferred\\nto as \\'the problemofexternalcontrol\\', \\'theproblemofthebranch\\xad\\nplanteconomy\\', andas such is reputed to have all kindsof\\nundesirable effects.Conceptualised moreprecisely, however, what\\nexternal controlreallymeansisthat,in theseregions,certainparts\\nof thefunctions ofeconomic ownership andpossession are missing.\\nAndconceptualised like this, someofitseffectslookrather\\ndifferent.\\nOnecommonly-cla imed effect ofexternal ownership is the\\nleakageofprofitsfrom the region ofproduction to the region of\\ncontrol.Thecomplaint isthatexternal controlleads to remissions\\nofprofitto aparentplantfrom where it need not bereinvested in\\nthe region oforigin. In its usual form this is a complaint which is\\noverstated andmisforrnulated.!\" Whatare at issue are the relations\\nandfunctions ofeconomic ownership. Fulleconomic ownership\\nconsistsofcontrolover the overall investment andaccumulation\\nprocess.Itis the loss ofthisfunction which leads to the likelihood\\noftheleakageofprofitandinvestment funds from the region. But\\nwhatdoes\\'theregion\\' mean?Thereisusually animplicit\\ncomparison with times gone by, yet in fact neither\\'theregion\\'as\\nanentity,whatever thatwould be, northedirectproducers within\\nit, ever had control, undercapitalist relations, overprofitsand\\ninvestment. Theusualargument putsthefocusentirely on\\ngeographical location to thecomplete exclusion ofclasslocation. Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 99\\nEven with geographically localownership ofproduction such\\nprofitscouldbewithdrawn from\\'theregion\\'andinvested else\\xad\\nwhere.Regionally-based capitalis not necessarily regionally \\'loyal\\';\\nindeed, given thatit isreasonably enterprising, it would be foolish\\nto be so. Here the social natureandorganisational structure of\\ncapitalisimportant. Certainly ownership bylargerandalready\\nmulti-regional companies will goalongwithincreasing geographical\\nflexibility and mobility.Thereare likely to behigherleakages of\\nprofit,therefore, butit is not by any means a new phenomenon\\nintroduced byexternal ownership. Nordoes the solution to the\\nproblem lie inspatialredistribution - in a fairer distribution of\\ncapitalists between the regions of a country-butin achangein, not\\njustthegeographical, but also the social locationoffulleconomic\\nownership.\\nThisreformulation ofwhatthequestion ofexternal ownership is\\nabout,inotherwords,changes also the political question -what\\ndoes it mean politically tocomplain ofexternalcontrol? Oneofthe\\nrecent policy responses in theUnitedKingdom ,partlyto this issue\\nand,conveniently, to the fact thatbig,multi-regional firms are no\\nlongerasourceofso much new employment , has been an emphasis\\non asmall-firm strategy;\\'backing localbusiness\\', \\'encouraging local\\nentrepreneurship\\' . As aresponse to the simple complaint ofexternal\\ncontrolthisstrategy is perfectly adequate, butittherebyprecisely\\nshows up the dangersof such a complaint. Forit failscompletely to\\nattackthedeeperissue, the combination ofgeographical andsocial\\ncontroloverinvestment. Even in the (unlikely) eventofsuch\\nstrategies succeeding, in terms ofthegrowthoflocalcontrol,that\\ncontrolwould simply mean the emergence orre-emergence of a\\nlocalcapitalist class.Foranything whichcouldmeaningfully be\\ncalled local control, reorganisation is needed not justofthespatial\\nbutalsoofthe social form oftherelations ofproduction. Itis a\\nfunction, not a class, which shouldbe reclaimed.\\nButthatraises afurtherissueaboutwhat\\'control\\' means in this\\ncontext. It isoftenarguedthatoneofthemajoreffectsofexternal\\nownership isthatit leaves the plantor locality \\'atthe mercy of\\nexternal forces\\'. Again, however, is this really new? Itwasexternal\\nforces - the external forcesofthemarketandofchanging\\ninternational relations - which laid waste the coalfields ofBritain\\nin the early partof thetwentieth century. Whatisdifferent isthat\\n\\'blame\\' can now be laid at an identifiable door- inDetroit, in New\\nYorkor inLondon. The locus ofresponsibility is nowpersonified. 100SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nInstead of suffering directly from the unplanned relations of the\\nmarket,people working in a branch plantexperience them through\\nthe mediation of plannedrelations within a company. But to see\\nthatas somehow \\'worse\\'than the previous situation is to blame\\nindividuals while accepting as inevitable the operation ofmarket\\nforces.Itis to givecredence to the marketas \\'natural\\', to accept in\\notherwords one of the fundamental underlying ideological tenets of\\ncapitalist social relations.\\nWhere, anyway, does \\'control\\' lie? It does not lie in individual\\npersonnel (in spite of the very real and considerable degree of\\nautonomy exercised by large corporations, and the degree of\\ncontrolover the marketconferred by monopoly power) but in the\\nwider relations of which they are part.Toreturnto an earlier\\ndiscussion, the personal qualities of a Henry Ford,a Michael\\nEdwardes or an Ian MacGregor, are not negligible in their effect\\noncompany behaviour but they have their effects within their\\nhistorical times. NeitherEdwardes nor MacGregor is likely to\\nrevive, single-handed, the production of cars or ofsteel. The logic\\nof economic forces does not determine the precise response of\\nindividual managers or of different types of companies, but neither\\nis action simply taken in a vacuum. Itisa response to something, to\\nwiderconditions of which those companies and managements are a\\npart.\\nAndthat, too, has its implications for policy. If real control, in\\nthatultimate sense which would be restricted by circumstances not\\nbeing of one\\'s own choosing, liesoutside the relations of production\\nin an individual firm, it follows thatit is not only insufficient to\\nchange the geographical location of control,it is also insufficient to\\nchange its class location if all thatmeans is thatdifferent people\\ntake over. A profit -oriented co-operative in a sea of marketforces\\nmay have all kinds of othersocial and political advantages, but it is\\nno less subject to the \\'external forces\\' of the marketthan is the\\nstraightforward capitalist firm. To get real local controlover\\nemployment it is necessary also to remove production from the\\nplayofmarketforces.Itis notjustthatthe claim should be for\\nfunctions of controlratherthan for a new breed of local business\\npeople, but thatthe functions too must be redesigned.They cannot,\\nif localcontrolis to be real, remain simply as defined by the wider\\nstructure of capitalist relations.\\nSome effects of thatbroad,descriptive thing \\'external control\\'\\nhave, then, perhapsbeenoverestimated or misread. They are real, Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 101\\nbut in forms, and with political implications, ratherdifferent from\\nthosecommonly adduced.\\nThereareothereffects too, also more easily interpreted when\\nexternalcontrolisconceptualised - andtherefore disaggregated - in\\ntermsofgeographically absentfunctions within the overall relations\\nofeconomic ownership andpossession .\\nFirst,branch plants may have lower local multipliers thanwould\\nbe the case if the whole enterprise werelocatedin one place. This\\nresultsfrom the loss to the headquarters regionofthemore\\nstrategic functions ofpossession, in otherwords from the centra\\xad\\nlisation of majorpurchasing functions dealingbothwithcapital\\ninvestment andwith services, particularly the whole rangeof\\nbusiness services. Ithas been found in a numberofstudiesthat\\nsuchfunctions may be missing from branchplantsandthatthatin\\nturnmay mean a lower proportion ofpurchases being made locally\\n- hence the lower local multiplier effects. The importance ofsuch\\neffects is open to empirical investigation and willcertainly vary, for\\ninstancedepending onwhetherthemarketareas for such goods and\\nservices would in any case be constrained toregional or local level.\\nTo the extent thatsuch an effect does result, however, it has a\\nnumberofimplications. It reduces the potential propulsive effectof\\nStateregional policies designed to attractinto declining regions\\ninvestment by multi regional andmultinational capital. And it\\nimpoverishes the level ofintegration ofa localeconomy, reducing\\nit to a collection ofisolatedproduction units with little connection\\nineconomic terms to each other.Bothofthese may make it more\\ndifficult to providethemomentum for\\'self-sustaining growth\\'in a\\nregion.\\nBranch-plant economiescan be a problem inotherways, too, for\\nthose who work in them. Branch-plant statusmay greatly increase\\nthedifficulties facingtradeunionnegotiators -andhere the\\nproblems areexacerbated if theheadquarters isabroadand not\\nmerely in anotherregionofthe same country. The difficulties are\\ntwofold. Above all, local management, low down the management\\nhierarchy but stillrequired to sit across the negotiating table, may\\nsimply not have the functions and levels ofcontroland responsi\\xad\\nbility which are being bargained over.Thosefunctions are located\\nelsewhere. Further, where the branchplantispartofa cloning\\nstructure, or where there is any degree ofdual-sourcing ,itis all too\\neasy for management tothreaten toplayoff oneplantagainstits\\nduplicate elsewhere. 102SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nThese, then, are some ofthecharacteristics andproblems ofthe\\nabsence from a locality with only branch-plant statusofsomeofthe\\nhigher-level functions ofeconomic ownership and possession. They\\nareattributes, therefore, which will characterise , to one degree or\\nanother and in some form or other,allbranch-plant formsof\\norganisation. They will characterise boththe cloning and the part\\xad\\nprocessspatialstructures.\\n* * *While in the cloning structure itis\\'only\\'these functions ofownership\\nand possession whichare removed from the branch-plant location, in\\nthepart-process structure branchplantsaredoublypenalised. Not\\nonly aremanagerial functions removed but soalso are wholesections\\nof the wider technical division oflabourinto which the plantis\\nembedded. Notonly is the plantsubordinated to anexternalised\\nhierarchy ofownership and possession, it is also subject to what\\nmight becalled \\'production dependence\\' .And the effects ofthis kind\\nofdependence arequitedifferent, andhavedifferent political\\nimplications, from those ofexternalownership alone.\\nFirst, thepart-process structure isalso likely to result in low local\\nmultipliers in thebranch-plant regions, but the reasons for this, and\\ntheimplications, are very different from those which result from\\nexternal ownership alone. To begin with, the cause is different. In\\nthis case the lack ofeconomic relations with the local economy\\nresults not from the centralisation ofordering procedures and\\ndecisions at head office but from the fact thattheactualmaterial\\nflowsofinputsandoutputsto theplantwill come from and go to\\notherplantswithin the same corporate structure. A factory or office\\nisjustone stage in the company\\'s production ofthecommodity .\\nThis means thatwhileexternal ownership may affect service links\\nmore than material ones (because of its relation to the functions of\\ncontrol),part-process dependence overwhelmingly affects material\\nlinkages (precisely because ofthenatureoftheplant\\'sinsertion into\\nthespatialstructure). Because external controldoes not require\\nproduction dependence butproduction dependence doesentail\\nexternal control, one would expect that, when\\'branchplants\\' are\\nconsidered as anundifferentiated category, service links will be\\nmore affected thanmaterial ones.ThusMarquand\\'s survey (1979)\\nfindsthatthe effect ismore marked, whenbranchplantsas a whole\\nareconsidered, in service than in manufacturing linkages. On the\\notherhand, studies ofindividual sectors whose forms ofspatial\\norganisation includeproduction dependence (e.g. some partsof Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 103\\nelectronics, andcars)oftenhavealmostno local material linkages.\\nThisdifference alsomeansthattheeconomic isolation ofplants\\xad\\ntheirlackofconnection to the local region- is likely to be much\\nstronger in the case ofpart-process dependence thaninthatof\\nexternal ownership alone.Plantswhichareembedded inboth\\nmanagerial andpart-process hierarchies reallyare\\'cathedrals in\\nthedesert\\'.Again,as withexternal control, apart-process structure\\nwillmakelifedifficult fortradeunionsandworkerorganisations,\\nbutagainthereasonsaredifferent fromandadditional tothose\\nwhichresultfromexternal ownership alone.Oneobvious reasonis\\nthatin apart-process structure localsympathetic actionbyworkers\\ninnearbyrelatedplantsandindustries may be moredifficult to\\norganise.Theveryisolation, thelinkageintocorporation rather\\nthanregion,willmeanthattherearefew, ifany,nearbyplantsand\\nindustries whicharerelated.\\nFinally, apart-process structure willmakemoredifficult any\\nattempts at local takeover andtheestablishment ofautonomous\\nproduction .Nowit may be askedwhatis thedifference between a\\nwholeseriesofplantsownedbydifferent companies butproviding\\neachotherwithinputs,andtheproduction hierarchies ofapart\\xad\\nprocessstructure? Are they notjustallpartofthegeneraldivision\\noflabourwithinsociety? In fact not;forplantsin apart-process\\nhierarchy aresubjectto anadditional kindofdependence.

As such the\\nplantcannot soeasilybeestablished as aseparate pointof\\nproduction ofprofit; it is less easy to takeoverandrun as a\\nlocally-autonomous entity.\\nObviously much,too, will dependon thetechnical natureofthe\\nproduction process, on thedegreetowhichthecapitalequipment is 104 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nparticular to theindividual product, but in general terms exactly the\\nsamecontrasts apply incomparison with a simple cloning structure .\\nThe high degree ofspecification ofproduction itself to a particular\\nbroaderstructure entailedin apart-process spatialformsubstan\\xad\\ntially increases the difficulty ofany moves towards localcontrol,\\nwhether in the form of nationalisation, where the interregional\\ndependence is alsointernational, or in the form ofworkers\\' control.\\nWithproduction dependence, it isnot only full economic ownership\\nwhich is missing - a situation rectifiable by takeover - but the\\nbroader productive structure as apartof which the particular\\nfactory has been planned.\\n* * *Eachofthe three spatialstructures, then, can be the basis for a\\ndifferent setofinterregional relations and form of interregional\\ndependence . In each ofthe three cases justlooked at the individual\\nregions play different kindsof\\'roles\\'within the overall system. So it\\nmattersin what kind ofspatialstructure aplantisembedded. It\\nmatters intermsofthekindofrelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination which exist between plantsindifferent localities, it\\nmattersfor the people who work in the plants,and itmatters\\npolitically.\\nItalsomattersmethodologically andconceptually. Oneofthe\\nunderlying themes implicit in all this is thatit isimportant to get\\naway from discussions ofapparently simple\\'objects\\', andto\\nconceptualise processes and relations. Objects are not simply given\\nto analysis, but are themselves products, and must be conceptua\\xad\\nlised in such a way as to incorporate, notjusttheir descriptive\\ncharacteristics, but also the process of their production, the larger\\ndynamic ofwhich they are part.Thenotionof\\'branchplant\\'is a\\ngood example. Itisprobably fair to say thatthephenomenon of\\n\\'branchplants\\'is too often treatedeitheras anunproblematical and\\nundifferentiated category, or asdifferentiated onlyaccording to\\nmanagerial preference, currentfashions in corporate organisation\\nor descriptive dimensions such as size.12There clearly are interfirm\\ndifferences in branch-plant autonomy, etc., which do depend on\\nsuch factors, and which do have effects. Whatisimportant is also\\ntoconceptualise thedifferent rolesbranchplantscan play in terms\\nofthedifferent spatialstructures in which they are embedded and\\nthedifferent larger processes and relations which they reflect. The\\ncontrast between branchplantsin apart-process hierarchy and\\nthose in a simple cloningstructure is an excellent case in point.The Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 105\\npossible differences in levels ofservice and material linkages have\\nalready been referred to, and there may be otherdistinctions. For\\nwhile the first kind ofbranchplantrepresents one stage of\\nproduction , the second represents additional capacity for all stages\\nofproduction. Thischaracteristic might lead the two types of\\nbranchplantto have very different relativepropensities to closure\\nduringdownturns in economic activity. Closures or reductions in\\ncapacity in branch plants in the part-process structure could not\\nreally take place withoutotherproduction locations experiencing\\nsimilarcutbacks (this does not, of course, apply to Rand0\\nfacilities). Such branchplantsdo not in any way perform the\\nfunction offlexible extra margins tocapacity. Itis, however,\\nprecisely this function which is played by branchplantsin the\\ncloning spatial structure and it is this kind ofbranchplantwhich\\none would expect to be more vulnerable toclosurein business\\ndownturns . There has been considerable debateover the years over\\nwhether ornot\\'branch-plant economies\\' aremoreliableto\\nemployment cutbacks andfluctuations because ofahigher\\npropensity to closure. Itwould certainly be worth investigating\\nwhether an analysis oftheir distinct roles within different spatial\\nstructures affects the implications for recipient regions ofnew\\nemployment with a high branch-plant component. A more analy\\xad\\nticaldistinction along these lines might help to throwlight on the\\napparently conflicting empirical evidence, and perhapsevenpoint\\nto avariation over time as different kinds of\\'branchplant\\'became\\nmorecommon.\\nThese examples oftheconnection betweenspatialstructures and\\nspatialrelations could be multiplied. A conglomerate formof\\nenterprise structure, forinstance, isdifferent again,and has\\ndifferent implications .Inthis case the specifically intersectoral\\nnatureofownership may, as a result ofthe kindofcharacteristics\\ndiscussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2, Characterising capital)add a\\nfurtherdegreeofvulnerability becauseofgreaterflexibility of\\ninvestment. Inthe caseofsubcontracting, the technical division of\\nlabour,and the overall production process, is underthecontrolof\\none firm which sends out certainstages, or partsofcertainstages,\\ntoothercompanies . Thus the legal independence oftheproducing\\ncompany is nullified by the actual controlofmany aspects of\\nownership and possession by the larger enterprise , while the form of\\ntheproductmaybeinfluenced by its defactosubordination into a\\npart-process hierarchy. The effects ofthis in terms ofdependence 106SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nandpotential instability ofemployment are well known. Subcon\\xad\\ntractingmay also take on a systematic spatialform. Pedersen (1978)\\nanalyses such a situation inDenmark , and its relationto regional\\ninequality . The three examples being used here are to illustrate an\\napproach, and within each there are numerous possiblevariations .\\nAnd many otherdifferent kindsofspatialstructure exist.\\nSpatialstructures and social structures\\nApartfrom leading to distinctkindsofinterregional relations, each\\nofthe different spatialstructures can also be associated with a\\ndifferent patternof socialdifferentiation between localities.This can\\nbeshownbylinkingup thedistinct geographical patterns of\\nrelations ofproduction which define each spatialstructure with\\nthe social characteristics ofthegroupsperforming thedifferent\\nfunctions .Itis notjusttherelations ofproduction which have a\\nspatialshape: so does the division oflabourbetween the social\\ngroupsperforming thedifferent functions within those relations. It\\nis possible, therefore , to link up the discussion ofsocial class in\\nChapter 2 withthatofspatialstructures earlierin thischapter.\\nFigure 3.5 summarises theargument so far.Ittakes anumberof\\noccupational groups, defines them in terms offunctions in the\\nrelations ofproduction , and thereby schematises their typical class\\nlocation. Iftheseconnections are now related to the specifically\\ngeographical organisation offunctions in each spatialstructure, the\\ndifferent social-geographical implications ofeachstructure are\\nimmediately apparent.\\nFirst, and most obviously , while a spatially-concentrated struc\\xad\\nture may leave each region with a locally-based capitalist class, this\\nclass will be lacking in those regions subject to external ownership\\nundertheothertwospatialstructures. Even in the region of\\nownership, moreover , thenatureofthecapitalist class may well\\nbedifferent fromthattypicalofspatially-concentrated production .\\nWhile in the lattercase it may consist ofindividual owners and\\ntraditional capitalists, in larger multi-regional corporations capital\\nis more likely to be personified in theshapeoftopcorporate\\nexecutives and top managers .

Certainly, regionsdominated byspatially\\xad\\nconcentrated production will include the full range ofadminis\\xad\\ntrativejobswithin their industries .Itmay well be, however, that\\nthosecompanies, precisely because they are small and confined to a\\nsingle region, are the ones with the more compressed managerial\\nhierarchies . This is indeed to be expected because the development\\nof such service functions ,through theextension of the division of\\nlabourincontrolandsupervision, ispartandparcelofthe\\nemergence oftheotherspatialstructures . Suchcontrasts may\\nsignificantly reduce (or reverse) the difference, withintheperipheral\\nregions, between plantsin thisspatialstructure and those in the\\nothertwo. This isa matterforempirical investigation . But the main\\npointisthatthecomparison at issue is between regions, and\\nbetween interregional variation indifferent spatialstructures .Itis\\nnot, as is sometimes supposed, between externally-owned plants\\nandlocally-owned ones within the same region. The argument is\\nnotprimarily - as it is sometimes seen to be - thatspatialstructures\\nwithinterregional hierarchies ofcontrolare\\'worse\\'in this way in\\nabsolute terms forperipheral regionsthanthelocationally-concen\\xad\\ntratedspatialstructure, butthattheyexacerbate thedifference on\\nthis score between peripheral andcentralregions. Indeed,in the\\nUnitedKingdom , manyofthe local areas which are now suffering\\nthe highest levels of externalcontrolare those in which white-collar\\nadministrative jobshave anyway for long formed a relatively small\\nproportion oftheemployment structure . The low numberofsuch\\njobsisnota newphenomenon. It is as a result ofacomparative,\\nnotanabsolute, worsening oftheirrepresentation inadministrative\\nandmanagerial jobsthatthe issue is now comingto the fore as an\\naspectof theregional policydebate.\\nOnceagain,moreover, conceptualising thingsintermsof\\ncapitalist relations ofproduction brings home the real issues. What\\nhasactually been lost to these regions is not a type ofjoband\\nassociated personnel (since such jobsand elements ofthe social\\nstructure hardlyexisted in these regions before) but a function\\nwithintheoverallsocialrelations ofproduction .Thespatial UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 109\\ninequality consists not so much in the uneven distribution ofjobs\\nofdifferent social types (and thus in some way of geographical\\n\\'equality ofopportunity\\') but in the removal from some regions,\\nand theconcentration inothers,of the more powerful, conceptual\\nandstrategic levels of controloverproduction. Moreover, it is\\nprecisely the development ofthe division of labourand the social\\nseparation of such functions to be performed by aseparate social\\ngroupwithin an extended hierarchy, which enables their geogra\\xad\\nphical removal. Once again the organisation ofproduction and the\\norganisation ofspace go handinhand.Particular formsof\\ngeographical inequality have as a necessary condition particular\\nformsoforganisation ofproduction. And inturn,the desire to take\\nadvantage ofspatialdistanceand difference can be what stimulates\\nthosedevelopments withinproduction.\\nThe three uses ofspace will also differ in their implications for\\ntherangeofjobsavailable toproduction - asopposed to\\nadministrative - workers. Obviously, the implications for thispart\\nof theemployment structure willdepend on the actualnatureofthe\\ntechnical division of labour,thenatureoftheassociated labour\\nprocesses, the kinds ofwagesand statusattached tojobs,and so on.\\nWhatcanbe said, however, is thatin the case oflocational\\nconcentration , the whole range ofworkers involved in production\\ninthatsector will be presentin one region. This range may be\\nnarrow, but such narrowness is not a function of thespatial\\nstructure itself. Much the same is likely to be true ofthe simple\\ncloningstructure - this use of space does not involve a part-process\\ndivision and the existence of a managerial hierarchy does not in\\nitself imply any differentiation inproduction jobs. Where there isa\\npart-process structure, however, themonofunctionality ofthe\\ndifferent plants may well lead to an accentuated separation of\\nparticular types of production workers into different regions. And\\nthese different types of production worker may belong to different\\npartsof the overall class structure. Once again, therefore, the\\npushing forward ofthedivision oflabour, this time within\\nproduction , when this also takes the form ofageographical\\nhierarchy, ismirrored ininterregional social difference. In the case\\nof the\\'electronics hierarchy\\' this social differentiation isparticu\\xad\\nlarly acute. Ifthedescription ofjobsin Figure 3.2 is put together\\nwith the definitions ofsocial class in Figure 3.5 it is clear thatthe\\nspatialhierarchy ofproduction coincides with a social hierarchy.\\nThis time the social hierarchy is, following Wright\\'s characterisa- 110Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\ntion,thatbetween petty bourgeoisie andworking class,alonga\\ndimension related to the level ofindividual jobcontrol. This\\ncontrasts with the social class spectrum associated with the\\nhierarchy ofownership andcontrolwhich, being primarily a\\nfunction ofcontroloverproduction as a whole. and with super\\xad\\nvision, follows the gradations betweenworkingclass and bourgeois.\\nThis element of \\'themiddle class\\', the RandDworkers, thus has a\\ndifferent origin from thatofthemanagement hierarchy. Here the\\ncontrolis over their own labourprocess,ratherthan the labourof\\nothers.Once again, this aspect of spatialstructures ofproduction\\nhas been raised as a political issue. This time the problem is\\ninterpreted as being a lack of RandDjobsinperipheral regions.\\nBut once again the claim for a \\'fairshare\\'ofthehigh-status\\ntechnocrats, as for a fair share ofupper-management orcapitalists,\\nseems a curiousone for the labourmovement to make. In local\\nStatepolicy terms the issue is mirrored in theestablishment of\\nscienceparksfor the privatesector,inadvertising thearea\\'s\\nuniversities and its environmental attractions (usuallyofthe\\'rural\\nidyll\\' variety). Everywhere wants to be Silicon Valley.\\nBut it is clear thatnot everywhere canbecome Silicon Valley.\\nBoth the impossibility ofsuch plans and hopes and the fundamental\\nambiguity ofdemands for more high-status jobsare clarified by\\nseeing, behind the kind ofemployment itself, the social function it\\nperforms in the overall structure ofcapitalist relations ofproduc\\xad\\ntion - and the fact thatit is precisely the result ofthe division of\\nlabourinto such unequal specialisms. The very fact thatthereis\\nSilicon Valleymeans thatthere must be production-only outposts in\\nperipheral regions, both inter- and intranationally. Forwhat is\\ndistributed aboutthe world is not just\\'kindsofjobs\\',butfunctions\\nwithin the overall structure ofcapitalist production. It is the fact of\\naparticular formoftechnological development, andofa corre\\xad\\nsponding technical division oflabourwithinproduction which\\nenables this form of spatialinequality to develop. The absence of\\nRandDworkers from the ThirdWorldandfromnational\\nperipheries, andtheircongregation insuchareasasSilicon\\nValley, has as a necessary prerequisite thedevelopment ofa\\ndivision oflabourinproduction where some peoplehave a\\nmonopoly ofthatkindofstrategic brain-work, and where such\\nwork isattached to highstatusand high reward, while othersare\\nrelegated to the tedium ofassembly. Once again, it is not so much\\ntypes ofjobswhich people in peripheral regionsshouldreclaim, but Uneven Development and SpatialStructuresIII\\nfunctions, integral partsofthe overall structure andrelations of\\nproduction .\\nThese are very simplified examples. The position in any real case\\nwill be more complex. Therewill, forinstance, beaccountants and\\notherprofessionals within the managerial hierarchy. Suchemploy\\xad\\neesare really partofwhat might becalled the production processof\\nmanagement. They are outsidethe direct supervisory structure of\\nauthority and have a considerable degreeofautonomy inorganis\\xad\\ning their own work. They will be more likely to fall in the spectrum\\nbetweenproletarian andpetty-bourgeois. Conversely the division of\\nlabourwithinproduction generates its own specific supervisory\\nstructure .Alongside the assembly workersat thebottomendofthe\\nhierarchy will be technical \\'testers\\'ofvarioussortswhose social\\nposition - asformally derived from theirposition in thejob\\nstructure - might take them out ofthestraightforwardly proletar\\xad\\nian and on to (though onlyjuston to) the spectrum with the\\nbourgeoisie. The actualformofdifferentiation in anyinstance is an\\nempirical question.\\nThis, then, lays out a formal means for investigating the links\\nbetween spatialstructures ofproduction and the geography of\\nsocialstructure . In later chapters it will be developed inrelationto\\ngeographical patterns inGreatBritain. But, to pick up again the\\nargument ofChapter 2,relations ofproduction are not all that\\nmatters. Figure 3.4 includes two industries in which assembly work\\noften forms one stage ofproduction:electronics and cars, yet the\\nsocialimplications of assembly work in the two industries are very\\ndifferent. Inelectronics, thejobisusuallydonebywomen,\\nsometime sworking part-time and always receiving low wages. In\\nthe carindustry theequivalent workers(if they are not replaced by\\nrobots) are male and form partof the core oftradeunioneconomic\\nmilitancy. This difference is not obvious from the natureofthejob\\nitself. Such aspects ofsocialstructure are notderivable from simple\\nexamination ofthejobstructure involved in a particular organisa\\xad\\ntion ofproduction .Neither,therefore , is thegeography ofsocial\\ndifferentiation simplyderivable fromspatialstructures ofproduc\\xad\\ntion.Itis at this point thatthe processes ofsocialallocation of\\ndifferent partsofthepopulation todifferent kindsofjobsbecomes\\nimportant. Existing social conditions outsidethefirm/sector , in\\notherwords, help determine the social organisation ofproduction\\nwithin it. And geography isimportant here too.\\n* * * 112SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nIt has been arguedin this section thatdifferent uses of space by\\nindustry (different spatialstructures) mayproduce distincteffects\\nonparticular regions, as well as alternative structures ofdifferentia\\xad\\ntionandpossibly inequality between regions. But equally, if not\\nmore,important isthatunderneath thishasgoneaparallel\\nargument whichemphasises stillfurtherthe need for theoretical\\nclarity.Forwhatmay look like a very similar regional phenomenon\\ncan have very different implications in terms of the interregional\\nstructure ofwhich it is part.Takean example: three different\\nregionsmay each have the same employment structure, all in\\nbranchplants,but indifferent industries and, crucially, in different\\nspatialstructures. In one it is the closing process in the footwear\\nindustry which is dominant, in the second electronics assembly, in\\nthethird,light engineering. In terms of employment in eachofthe\\nregions the effect is broadlythe same - a jobstructure dominated by\\nlow-paid anddistinctly uninspiring jobsforwomen, andonly\\nmiddle-level administrative jobs. But,apartfrom the common fact\\nofexternalownership, thestructures ofdifferentiation in which the\\nregions are embedded aredifferent in each case.\\nInfootwear, the region will be playinga role in a technical\\ndivisionoflabourwithin the industry. Theotherstages are not\\nresearch and skilled production, as inelectronics, but thecutting\\nprocess. As we have seen, this is performed by men and the two\\nstages may be separately locatedwhen the cost-surfaces ofthe two\\nkinds of labourare different. To the extentthatthis is ahierarchy\\nat all, it is one based on differences within manualworkersand on\\nsexualdiscrimination . Simply, in one region the men have jobs,in\\ntheotherthewomen,andin the first regionwagesare,in\\nconsequence, higherthanin the second. The income and status\\ndifferences in the electronics case, and consequently the degree of\\noverall regional inequality, are fargreater.They involve a span\\nbetween semi-skilled, skilled manualandhigh-status technical jobs.\\nIn the case oflightengineering, no technical division oflabourmay\\nbe involved at all, in which case the region will have the same\\nproduction employment structure asothersin which production\\nexists.\\nThereis more to a \\'distribution ofemployment\\' thanmeets the\\neye. Such a distribution is notjustapattern;it is the result ofan\\nunderlying structure .Whatis at issue is the way in which different\\nlocalities can beincorporated into the developing relations of\\ncapitalist production. In this example, similaremployment effects UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 113\\nin aparticular regionactually result from very different structures\\nandconsequently havedifferent implications for\\'interregional\\nrelations\\'. Andwhat this means in turnisthatthey have also very\\ndifferent implications foractionif thoserelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination are to be combated.\\n3.4The uniqueness of place\\nNo two places are alike. People who only stopover atairports(to\\nand from conferences ,perhaps) might get the impression ofa\\npervading similarity, but any deeperexploration will soon dispel\\nthatillusion.Geographical variation isprofound andpersistent, and\\nthis is true even within a country asapparently homogeneously\\ndeveloped as theUnitedKingdom . Wetalkof\\'theperipheral\\nregions\\', but they are all very different. The term \\'innercities\\'\\nincludes Merseyside, Glasgow andLondon, asdifferent as can be\\ninculture,political historyand thecharacter ofthelabourmove\\xad\\nment. Any trainjourney acrosscountry provides ample evidence:\\ndifferent kindsofpeople get on andoffatLancaster ,Grange-over\\xad\\nSands and Barrow-in-Furness.\\nAs we have alreadyargued, these differences matter.Mostpeople\\nstill live their lives locally, their consciousness is formed in a distinct\\ngeographical place.Atanyone timedifferent areasmay be\\nchanging incontrasting ways;different battlesare being fought\\nout,different problems faced.\\nSo how can this variety be analysed? Spatially-differentiated\\npatternsofproduction are one ofthe bases ofgeographical\\nvariation in social structure and class relations. They are not the\\nonlycause,butthey are significant. Theanalysis ofregional\\ncontrasts andconflicts in Belgium in Chapter 2showedclearly\\nhow the organisation ofproduction can be an important condition\\nfor the development of social andpolitical culture. Gramsci\\'s\\nanalyses ofTurinbringout many ofthe same points:\\'Turin. . .\\nis theindustrial city, theproletarian city,parexcellence .. .like one\\ngreatfactory...powerfully united by industrial production. The\\nTurinproletariat was able to advance so faralongtheroadof\\nSoviet-type massorganisation precisely because ofthispowerfully\\nunitedcharacter ofthe city\\'s industry\\' (1920, p. 151).\\nIt is not, of course, as simple as that.Forone thing, local areas\\nrarely bear the marksofonly one form ofeconomic structure . They 114SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nareproducts oflong and varied histories.Different economic\\nactivities and forms ofsocialorganisation have come and gone,\\nestablished theirdominance, lingered on, and later died away.\\nViewed more analytically , andconcentrating for themoment on the\\neconomic, thestructure oflocaleconomies can be seen as a product\\nofthecombination of\\'layers\\',ofthe successive imposition over the\\nyearsofnewroundsofinvestment, new forms ofactivity.\\nThese new forms oflocal activity are each related to a wider\\nsetting.Spatialstructures ofdifferent kindscan be viewed\\nhistorically (and very schematically) as emerging in a succession\\nin which each is superimposed upon, and combined with, the effects\\nofthespatialstructures which came before. In each ofthesespatial\\nstructures economic activity in an individual local area plays a\\nspecific role and exists in certainrelations ofdominance and\\nsubordination witheconomic activity in otherareas. Each spatial\\nstructure is a system ofinterdependence into which the industrial\\nactivityofany local area is inserted. So if a local economy can be\\nanalysed as the historical productofthecombination oflayersof\\nactivity, those layers also represent in turn the succession ofroles\\nthe local economy has played within wider national andinterna\\xad\\ntionalspatialstructures .\\nEach new layer, each new roundofinvestment, brings with it\\npotentially neweconomic basesofsocialorganisation, new\\n\\'structural capacities\\' anda newoverallposition withinthe\\nbroadergeographical divisionoflabour. In the preceding section\\nwe drew outsomeoftheinternally necessary implications ofa\\nrangeofdifferent spatialstructures. But the effects ofspatial\\nstructures in aparticular situation cannotbepredicted from such\\na logic alone. The actualimplications willdepend,notjuston the\\nnatureofthe new roundofinvestment, but also on the existing\\ncharacter ofthe areas affected. The combination oflayers is a form\\nofmutualdetermination, ofthe existing characteristics ofthe area\\nor regional system with those ofthegeographical patternand\\neffectsofprevious uses.Thus,for example, while a spatially\\xad\\nconcentrated structure implies a local capitalist class and other\\nspatialstructures donot,if those uses ofan area succeed each\\nother,onequestion will be how the class related to the earlier\\nspatialstructure reorientates itspositionwithin the region. Clearly,\\nthe kinds ofchanges which do occur will dependbothon the\\ncharacteristics oftheincoming industry, the way its activity in the\\narea isincorporated into its overall spatialstructure, and on the Uneven Development and SpatialStructures 115\\nexistingstructure of industry in the area (e.g. Lojkine, 1977).Lipietz\\n(1977, pp. 85, 89 et seq.)pointsto the kinds of battles between\\ndifferent parts of capital, and the consequent changes in the local\\nbalance between them which can ensue from the entry ofnational\\nandinternational firms into an area hithertodominated by smaller\\nand more regionally-based companies. Theincorporation ofa local\\narea into a new division of labouris likely to cause change and\\ndisruption , economically and socially. This, too, is a social and\\nhistorical process. So Foster\\'s (1974) analysis ofthefootwear\\nindustry in Northampton does indicate how the natureof the\\nlabourmarketthere, and the particular use made ofit, was one\\ncondition for the weakness ofthelabourmovement. But \\'if this was\\nthe problem, it only proved insurmountable because it was not\\npossible to use the same tactics as in Oldham\\' (p. 103).And this in\\nturnwas due to an inheritance ofhistory:\\'Unlike Oldham,\\nNorthampton hadexperienced littlewartime radicalism and\\ncertainly no breakdown in law and order. A food riot in spring\\n1795had quickly been smashed up by the Horse Guardsand by the\\nsecondquarterof thecenturythere was an efficient police force and\\napermanent garrison.Consequently withoutanytradition of anti\\xad\\nstatelaboursolidarity and with strong-arm tactics ruled out, there\\nwas almost no way ofimposing union discipline on the constant\\nstreamofimmigrant workers\\'.Itwas not justlabour-market\\nconditions but the lack of a history of organisation which made\\nunionisation so difficult. And this in turn was the result of conflict.\\n\\'In terms ofindustrial coercion the bootwas very much on the\\notherfoot. Savage punishments - flogging, imprisonment - were\\ninflicted for work offences, jailings were successfully used to break\\nthe trades movement of1834\\'(p. 103).And the effects of this were\\ntocolourlocal politics for a long time ahead. \\'So, instead of a\\nlabourmovement, all thatexisted were small islands of organised\\nworkers ...Northampton politics reflect this situation closely ...\\nIndeed it is this . . . that holds the key to Northampton politics\\nright up till the ascendancy ofBradlaugh\\' (pp. 103-4).\\nTheoutcomeofthedisruption, and the form and direction of the\\nchange,thatresults from the insertion ofa local area into a new\\ndivision of labour,willdepend on the existing character ofthe area,\\nitself the result of an alreadylong and complex history. Local\\nchanges and characteristics are notjustsome simple \\'reflection\\' of\\nbroader processes; local areas are not justin passive receipt of\\nchanges handed down from some higher national orinternational 116SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nlevel. The vast variety ofconditions alreadyexisting at local level\\nalso affects how those processes themselves operate.\\nIt isalso more than this. We are talkingprimarily oftheeconomy\\nand\\'theeconomic\\', yet the sequence ofwidercontexts within which\\nlocalities are set is also ideological and political; social in a much\\nbroadersense. The social changes in an area, the shifts in prevailing\\nideology and temperament , are not boundup only with economic\\nchanges within thatlocality. They reflect also broadershifts and in\\notheraspectsofsociety. The layers ofhistory which are sedimented\\nover time are not justeconomic; there are also cultural, political\\nand ideological strata,layers which also have their local specifi\\xad\\ncities. And this aspect oftheconstruction of\\'locality\\' further\\nreinforces theimpossibility ofreading offfrom a \\'layerof\\ninvestment\\' anyautomatic reverberations on thecharacter ofa\\nparticular area.\\nConceptualising things in this way makes it possible to combine\\nanunderstanding ofgeneral trends with a recognition, alongside\\nand within that,of very great diversity. The uniqueness ofplace and\\ntheconstantly evolving and shifting systems of interdependence are\\ntwo sides of the same coin.\\n* * *When,in the middle decades of the twentieth century, geographers\\nswitched their main concernfromunderstanding the complexity and\\nuniqueness ofregionstowardsthe vigorous pursuitofempirically\\xad\\ngeneralisable laws, the debatewas often posed in terms ofthe\\nspecific and consequently descriptive versus the generalisable and\\nsupposedly scientific. Therewas, it was argued,little one could do\\nwith the uniquesavecontemplate it; the aim shouldbe to identify\\nempirically-observable relations which had a sufficient degree of\\nregularity to be graced with the statusof\\'law\\'.Theargument here is\\nthattheopposition presupposed inthatdebateis itself a false one.\\n\\'General laws\\' are aboutcausation , not empirical correlation. They\\nare as well if notbetterestablished incausalstudiesofthe\\nparticular, themuch-maligned \\'casestudy\\'. And by the same\\ntoken, the unique, the productofmanydeterminations , iscertainly\\namenable to analysis. It is indeed time thatregional and local\\nparticularities werereinstated as acentralfocusofgeographical\\nthinking. This is not to argue for a returnto\\'goodold-fashioned\\nregional studies\\' but to suggest thatthe same subject mattercan\\nnow beapproached within a rigorous analytical framework, with\\nsomeunderstanding oftherelationbetween the general and the UnevenDevelopment andSpatialStructures 117\\nparticular, andwith anappreciation ofhow each local areafitsinto\\nthe wider scheme ofcapitalist production andsocialrelations. There\\nis a basis for a new regional geography .\\nTheimplications ofthisimpinge onotherdebates, for if the\\nactualempirical implications ofany given spatialstructure cannot\\nbe logically deduced, but must be analysed as theresultofits\\ncombination with the existingcharacter ofanarea, it follows that\\nthe effects ofany given productive activitymay vary from region to\\nregion.Merseyside andtheMezzogiorno, SaoPauloandBridgend\\nhave all been drawninto theworld-wide production ofcars,but the\\nimplications for each have been very different. Theeffectsofthe\\ninstallation ofmajorcoastalsteelandpetrochemical complexes\\nhavenotbeenreplicated in each case. Theinvestments atDunkirk\\n(Castells andGodard, 1974), Fos-sur-Mer (Bleitrach andChenu,\\n1975) and Taranto (Courlet, 1977) were notexactlythe same in\\ntheirimpact.Theyvariedaccording to theparticular characteristics,\\nthehistoryandpresentconditions ,ofeach local area.Andthe fact\\nthatthese effects ofparticular spatialstructures will vary according\\nto theconditions in which they operatemeansthatit is fruitless to\\nexamine the real world for an empirically-generalised outcome in\\nordertosubstantiate someinherent logic.Theinternalnecessity of\\naspatialstructure does not get \\'actedout\\'in the real world in pure\\nform.Whattakes place is the interrelation ofthe new spatial\\nstructure with theaccumulated resultsofthe old.The\\'combination\\'\\noflayers, in otherwords, really does mean combination, with each\\nsideofthe process affecting theother. So this way oflookingat the\\nworld is in no sense deterministic .\\'Structural analysis\\' as it has\\nsometimes beencalled,doesnotnecessarily mean\\'top-down \\'\\nanalysis; far from obliterating thepossibility ofvariety,itprovides\\nanapproach to itsexplanation.\\nMoreover ,notonlymayagivenproduction facility have\\ndifferent effectsindifferent regions, butareaswithdifferent\\nhistories may also provide advantageous locations for the same\\nkindofproduction.

But those\\nlabourreserves came out ofverydifferent socialhistories. Location\\ntheoryhastendedto seelabouravailability as a\\'location factor\\'. It\\nis,ofcourse; but such \\'location factors\\'are also the productof\\nsocialrelations, ofaregion\\'s previous succession ofroles in the\\nwidernational andinternational spatialstructures. Thisbringsus 118SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nfull circle: it is precisely because areas have different histories that\\nthe arrival of a new form ofeconomic activity has in each case\\ndistinct social and economic results.\\nSo far in this section it has been implied thatthe economic\\nstructure of a region is the productofa seriesof simple and discrete\\nroundsof investment, in each of which one new spatial structure\\nwill bearticulated with a given spatial surface. But the historical\\nprocess is more complex than this. At any given time, more than\\none new spatial structure may bein the process ofestablishment, be\\nundergoing changes, or be disappearing with decline. Itis the effect\\nofthecombination of all these changes with the existing geogra\\xad\\nphicalpattern(itself the result of previous uses ofspace) which\\ncontributes to the distinctive economic characteristics of local areas.\\nThe veryfact thata region may, throughthe variety of itseconomic\\nactivities, be embedded in a multitude of spatial structures, each\\nentailing different organisations ofdominance andsubordination,\\nserves to emphasise thatit is not regions which interrelate, but the\\nsocial relations of production which take place over space. The\\nresultsofall this in terms ofthe geographical distribution ofsocial\\nclasses and groups is a geographical. or spatial. divisionoflabourin\\nthecountryas a whole. And it is this which forms the basis - the\\nnew locational surface - for subsequent patternsof investment.\\nTheincorporation ofan area into anew,dominant, spatial\\nstructure may have one ofanumberof different effects on the\\nsocial and economic statusof that region. Itmay well be thatits\\nnew role simply reinforces the social and economic advantage or\\ndisadvantage of the area. Itmay, however, be thatthe fortunes of a\\nregion are reversed, that in terms of a given range of indicators its\\n\\'performance\\' becomes closer to thatofthenational average. Yet\\nagain, it may be thatthe relative advantage ordisadvantage of the\\nregion is maintained in some general sense but thatit ischanged in\\nitsnaturein termsofthe indices on which it can be measured. In\\notherwords, both the economic structure which underlies inter\\xad\\nregional inequality, and the way in which thatinequality is\\nexpressed socially, are transformed .Geographical differentiation\\nhas been reproduced, but in a changed form. Each ofthese\\nsituations isentirely different, but any approach toregional\\nanalysis must be able to handle\\'them all. The cumulative causation\\nmodel of Myrdal (1957),and adoptedby Holland (1976),can only\\nhandle the first case. The equilibrating mechanisms ofneoclassical\\neconomics are happy only with the second. Neitherofthem can Uneven Development and Spatial Structures 119\\ndeal with the third. But they all happen.Unfortunately, someofthe\\nalternative approaches to analysis developed recently (see Chap\\xad\\nter 2) also tend to be restricted to expecting only one outcome - in\\nthis case usually increasing inequality . Anyadequate framework\\nmust be able to deal with any ofthese cases. Itis notenoughto\\nresort to a separate, andtherefore deterministic ,\\'model\\'for each\\ndifferent empirical outcome.\\nUp to now we have been dealing with the effectsofthe\\ncombination ofnew forms ofeconomic activity with the existing\\ncharacteristics ofaparticular area. It was implicit thatthis\\'area\\'\\nhadalreadybeen defined. In fact, however, shifts in the dominant\\nspatial division oflabourmayproduce acomplete change in the\\nverygeographical patternofspatialdifferentiation .Thishas\\nimportant implications forwhatismeantby \\'aregion\\'or \\'a\\nlocality\\'.Itis very possible for the patternofgeographical\\ninequality to change. Regions themselves are products ofthese\\nprocesses, so the geographical framework for studies ofspatial\\nstructures must allow for the possibility ofits owntransformation.\\n* * *Thishistorical process can also be schematised atnational level.\\nHere, successive layers ofspatialstructures ofproduction lay the\\nbasis for a sequence ofspatialdivisions oflabour.At anypointin\\ntime the geographical patternofeconomic activity which is\\nassociated with the new spatialstructures isoverlaid on and\\ncombined with the patternproduced in previous periods. And each\\nnewcombination ofsuccessive layers produces , or may produce, a\\nnew form and a new distribution ofinequality, which in turn is the\\ngeographical basis for the next roundofinvestment. \\'The regional\\nproblem\\', orspatialinequality moregenerally, is thus a very\\ncomplex thing. Itwillchangeover time in bothform and pattern.\\nItmay alter in terms ofthenatureoftheunderlying interregional\\nrelations, in termsofthe social differences and inequalities on which\\nit ismeasured , and in the terms ofitsgeographical shape. And this\\nshifting intranational inequality isitselflockedintoawider\\ninternational setofspatialstructures and division oflabour.\\nThe fact thatthere is such geographical differentiation within a\\ncountry,thatthere is regional inequality or an\\'innercityproblem\\',\\nhas animpacton theoperation ofwhat are often thoughtofas\\n\\'national\\' processes .Itmay help orhindernational ratesof\\naccumulation .Itis not possible to make any a prioriassumptions\\naboutwhetherthe effects ofthepatternofspatialdifference will be 120SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nproblematical orpositively useful for capital, butthere will be\\neffects.Indeed,it isentirelypossible thattheimplications will be\\ndifferent fordifferent partsofcapital.This was clearly the case in\\nItalyover the pastfew decades (see Chapter 2).Spatialinequality\\nandgeographical differentiation may also be influential in the\\nformation ofnational political alliances and the formulation of\\napparently national, as well as clearly spatial, policies. Therewill be\\neffects, too, on national classrelations andclassstructure. Seen in\\none way, the sum totalof all the changes going on in the different\\npartsofacountrymayaddup to an \\'aggregate\\' national effect. But\\nit may also be thatgeographical separation andgeographical\\ndifferentiation areimportant to theproduction ofthatnational\\neffect. Once again,\\'geography\\' isnotjustaproduct ofsocial\\nrelations; itis anintegralpartoftheirdevelopment. Lipietz (1977)\\nwrites: \\'La structuration de I\\'espace est la dimension spatialedes\\nrapports sociaux, et, ceux-ci etantluttesde classes, lastructuration\\nde l\\'espace est luttes de classes, nonseulement en ce sens qu\\'elleen\\nest Ieproduit, mais en ce qu\\'elleen est un enjeu et meme un moyen\\'\\n(p.90).\\nOneofthearguments ofthe restofthisbookisthatchangesof\\nthissort,wheregeography is animportant component of classand\\npolitical relations, are going on now in the UnitedKingdom . 4\\nSomeChanging SpatialStructures in\\ntheUnitedKingdom\\n4.1Settingthe scene\\nThe inheritance: social and spatial\\nMuchofwhat is peculiarly characteristic of \\'British capitalism\\', of\\nBritisheconomy and society, stems from the long inheritance ofits\\ninternational positionand role. Frommerchant capitalism, through\\nthe heyday of Empireand the dominance ofinternational trade\\nthrough its role as workshop of the world, to the long twentieth\\xad\\ncenturyprocessofdecline, this international orientation ,though\\nchanging in its form and in its implications, has been fundamental\\n(Gamble, 1981). And this inheritance hasnotbeen one which\\nregistered only in economic terms. The economic role within the\\nnineteenth-century international divisionoflabourleft itsmarkin\\nthe form of a particular setofclassrelations andparticular contours\\nofclassstructure. Itisthrough theseclassrelations andtheir\\nconsequences fornational politics that\\'theBritisheconomy\\' ,\\naccumulation within the geographical boundaries of thenation\\nstate,continues to beaffected,constrained, andoftenunder\\xad\\nmined, by its inheritance from the past.\\nThestructure ofthecapitalist class still shows these marksvery\\nclearly.Probably the most celebrated effect is the unusualdegreeof\\nseparation which has historically existed in Britainbetween banking\\ncapitalandindustrial capital(see Brett et al.,1975;Gough,1975;\\nGroves et al.,1975;National Economic Development Office\\n(NEDO), 1976; Hu, 1975). The fact thatfor years British banking\\ncapitalhadthewholeworldtochoosefromwhenselecting\\nprofitable investments enabledthegrowthofapowerful financial\\ncentreandencouraged in it an international andspeculative\\ncharacter ratherthananypropensity to invest in home-based\\nBritishindustry. ThegrowthofEmpire and ofa wider world\\nrole, which went handinhandwith the development ofthepower\\nbaseof\\'theCity\\',afforded too many otheropportunities . The\\n121 122SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncorollary, of course, is thatthe health ofthe financial sector has a\\nhigh degree of independence from the health of the home-based\\neconomy. The money which British bankingcapital lends to British\\nindustry tends to be in the form of short-term (and more recently\\nmedium-term) loans ratherthan of long-term commitments . The\\neffect is not so much a shortage of cash for investment in industry\\n(the claim sometimes made) but a certain separation of interests\\nbetween\\'theCity\\' and \\'industry\\' and a relative lack ofinstitutional\\nconnection between the two.\\nButthatdivision within British capital is not the only one, nor\\neven always the most important. Thecharacter ofindustrial, and\\nparticularly manufacturing , capital has also been moulded by the\\nlegacyofEmpire and the international domination ofa century and\\na half ago. Again for reasons of opportunity historicaIly available\\nto British capital more thananyother,Britishmanufacturing\\nindustry has had a particularly high tendency to direct investment\\noverseas. One effect ofthis has been the development within British\\nindustry of a veritable chasm between on the one side highly\\ninternationalised sections with a major, often themajor,orientation\\noverseas and on the othersections where production is confined to\\nthenational or even regional levels.Theimportance ofthe\\ninternationalised sections in turn lies behind the relatively low\\nlevelsofinvestment \\'athome\\', the increasingly outdated capital\\nstock and the tendency to falI behind competitors in levels of\\nproductivity . Muchofthe investment which goes overseas is in the\\nnewesttechnologies and the newest products. British industry\\nprovides at the international levela telling example ofthepoint\\nmade in Chapter 3thathaving your capital owned locally, \\'your\\nowncapitalist class\\', is no guarantee at all of local reinvestment.\\nThese lines ofdivide, between financial and industrial capital and\\nbetweeninternational and national elements within industry, cross\\xad\\ncut each other, each having its effect on political formation and on\\npolicy. Their combination has meant thatfinancial and interna\\xad\\ntional perspectives and interests have been more powerful politicaIlythan has nationally-based industrial capital. This has been reflected\\nin theorganisation of the State. The natureanddominance\\nofthe\\nTreasury is frequently acknowledged, but the impact goes deeper\\nthanthat- asGamble(1981)points out \\'therehas never . ..been a\\npermanent government department to speak for and represent the\\ninterests of the national economy and national industry\\' (p. 180).\\nNot surprisingly, this internalstructure ofBritish capital has also Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 123\\nfound its reflection in policy, and in particular in the concern for\\nthestrengthof sterling. The two strongest and most dynamic parts\\nof British-owned capital - the banking sector and big, internatio\\xad\\nnalised industry - have interests which coincide neither with the\\nrequirements of astronginternal economy nor on all occasions with\\neachother\\'s. British capital and the British economy are by no\\nmeans the same thing. And both the political strength of the City\\nand ofinternationalised industry and the conflicts between those\\ninterests and those of the British nationaleconomy continue to this\\nday.\\nThe early and wide extension of capitalist relations ofproduc\\xad\\ntion, and the legacy of Empire and international dominance, had\\neffects also on the working class. The British labourmovement is\\nstrongin economic and industrial terms. It is a strength which in\\npartderives from both its sheer numerical importance and the\\nability of British capital in the nineteenth centuryto appease its\\n\\'own\\'working class with a share of the imperial spoils. But it is an\\neconomic strengthratherthan a political one. The relation between\\nparty and trade unions is the reverse ofthatin, for instance, Italy\\nand France. In the United Kingdom the unions gave birth to the\\nLabourParty, and thus was established a separation between the\\npolitical and the economic wings of the labourmovement. The\\ntrade union movement\\'s considerable strength, itscomparative\\nindependence from the State and the importance of itsshop-floor\\nlevel oforganisation have, with notableexceptions, tended to be\\nassociated with a sphere ofactivity more or less confined to\\neconomic defence and a resistance to changes in production which\\nhas occasionally been characterised asLuddite.Infact, over the\\nperiod dealt with here, the union movement has countenanced huge\\nlosses of jobsin the name oftechnological progress. But in many\\nsectors of the economy capital\\'s attempts atmodernisation did not\\ncome until too late, until decline had alreadyset in.Undersuch\\ncircumstances, programmes ofinvestment, modernisation and\\ntechnical change inevitably produced consequences more at odds\\nwith the immediate interests of labourthanthey would have if\\npursued in a period of expansion.\\nThe conflicts, then, were complex. Within capitalthere was a\\nstraightforward conflict between the dominant elements with their\\npoliticalcommitment to themaintenance ofthetraditional world\\nrole,andtherequirement tomodernise thesocietyandthe\\neconomy. The dominant political interests have been reflected in 124SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe liberal bias ofa State which has been consistently unwilling\\neitherto tackle the archaicinstitutions ofBritish society, which\\nserved to preserve Empire and class rule ratherthan the interestsof\\naccumulation in the home economy (\\'interests\\' for which there was\\nno powerful political voice), or to intervene directly in industry to\\npromote rationalisation orgreaterproductivity. This went together\\nwith the indisputable factthatsuch a process would in any case be\\nproblematic, given the economic and defensive strength ofthe\\norganised working class.\\n* * *Geography was integral to all ofthis. The internalgeography ofthe\\ncountryreflected its international position. Thedominance ofCity,\\nEmpire and tradecontributed to theimportance ofState, financial\\nandcommercial activities, and of the employment associated with\\nthem, in London. Thedominant formofregional problem in the\\nUnitedKingdom throughout theearlierpartofthetwentieth\\ncenturywas also in partaninheritance ofEmpire.Itresulted from\\nthe decline ofmajorsectorsofthe economy with particular formsof\\nspatialstructure.Itwas those spatialstructures whichmoulded the\\nnational geography ofemployment from the nineteenth centuryup\\nto the 1930s, and which were characteristic ofa smallgroupof\\nindustries -coal-mining andexporting , iron and steel manufacture ,\\nshipbuilding - which owed their dominance in thegeography of\\nemployment to the role ofthe United Kingdom overthatperiod in\\ntheinternational division of labour.Itwas the United Kingdom \\'s\\nposition as animperial power, its early lead in the growthof\\nmodern industry, and its consequent commitment to freetrade\\nand to its own specialisation inmanufacturing withinthisinterna\\xad\\ntional division oflabour, whichenabledthe rapid growth, up to the\\nFirst World War,ofthesemajorexporting industries . Thespatial\\nstructures which were established by those industries were those\\nwhere all stages ofproduction of thecommodity areconcentrated\\nwithin single geographical areas. The comparatively low level of\\nseparation offunctions within the process of production , and the\\nrelatively small variation inlocational requirements between such\\npotentially separable functions , were not sufficient to make geo\\xad\\ngraphical differentiation a major attraction . Inestablishing this\\nspatialpatternofproduction within the United Kingdom these\\nindustries soughtaccess to portsforimportofrawmaterialand for\\nexporting goods, a plentiful supply oflabour, and, to some extent\\nstill, access to coal. Since these were characteristics not evenly Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 125\\ndistributed overthecountry, thegeographical pattern which\\nevolved was simply thateachofthesemajorindustries concen\\xad\\ntrateditsproduction on one, or a small numberof, regions. Ships in\\nClydeside andthenorth-eastofEngland, coal insouthWales,and\\nso on.Conversely, given the simple quantitative importance ofthese\\nindustries, anumberofmajorregionsofthecountrybecameheavily\\nspecialised in one or two oftheseindustries .\\nThisgeographical structure was based on the dominant roleof\\nBritainin the world economy andon thecharacteristics of the\\nconsequently dominant industries. Itwas theformerwhichensured\\ntheimportance ofthelatter.Inthe early twentieth century, halfof\\nBritish iron andsteelproduction and athirdofcoaloutputwas\\nexported directly(DeaneandCole, 1967), while bothwerefurther\\nused inotherindustries which in turn were also based on Britain\\'s\\ninternational role. Ontheotherhandit wasthestageof\\ndevelopment oftheindustries themselves whichinfluenced the\\nkindofspatialstructure which was adopted.\\nThespatialdivision of labourwithin the countryas a whole was\\nthus based primarily ondifferent sectoral specialisations .Itwas\\nonly when the UnitedKingdom \\'srelation to theinternational\\neconomy changed, with its decline as a world tradingpower,that\\nproduction in theseindustries felldrastically andthesepreviously\\xad\\ndominant spatialstructures produced aregional problem. Muchof\\nthis old basis of Empire andinternational dominance has over the\\nyears been nationalised andthecapitalwhich once owned them,\\noftenitselfregionally based, has moved offintoothersectorsand\\nothergeographical areas.The new industries ofthetwentieth\\ncenturygrew up in the south-east andmidlands ofEngland. At\\nfirst, too, there was some acquiescence on thepartof theupper\\nechelons ofthetradeunionmovement (itself for the same reasons\\nundergoing achangein itsinternal balance of power) to this\\nsectoralandgeographical refocusing oftheeconomy. \\'The demise\\nofthebasicindustries wasaccepted as a\"second industrial\\nrevolution\" particularly byCitrine(TheGeneral Secretary) and\\nBevin(TGWU General Secretary)\\' (Cooke, 1981b, p. 25). Such\\nunion leaders, as representatives ofthe new industries andin the\\ncontextoftheir new co-operation with the State,therebyeased the\\nway for the establishment of thenewly-emerging spatialdivisionof\\nlabour.\\'Theinterests of theright-wing generalunions(TGWU and\\nNUGMW) in the new semi-skilled industries , andtheirsubsequent\\ninvolvement ingovernment , most obviously in the shapeof Bevin, 126SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nreflected the regional as well as the sectoral shiftthathadtaken\\nplace in the power-relations ofindustrial Britain\\'(Cooke,pp.26-7).\\nBut the decline ofthe old basic sectorsproduced appalling poverty\\nandapersistent \\'regional problem\\'.For,becauseofthespatial\\nstructure oftheseindustries, andtheirdominance ofparticular\\nregions, the effect ofthischangeineconomic andpolitical relations\\nwas simply thatsectoral declinebrought with itregional decline.\\nTheindices on which this kind of regional inequality wasregistered\\n(inotherwords,the kindofregional problem which was produced)\\nwere the ones which becamethe classic measures of\\'theregional\\nproblem\\' inBritain. Themostimportant ofthesemeasures was\\nunemployment, with the level ofoutmigration , percapitaearnings,\\nandthe level ofmanufacturing employment playing subsidiary\\nroles.\\nTherewere,ofcourse,othergroupsofindustries which were\\nimportant, bothin thenational economy andin thegeographical\\nstructure, whichderivedmuchof theirpre-eminence fromBritain\\'s\\ninternational position andwhichhavesubsequently declined.\\nTextiles, primarily cottontextiles, are the mostobvious example.\\nBut there are interesting differences between textiles on the one\\nhandandcoal, iron andsteelandshipbuilding on theother.First,\\nthey are from different partsoftheeconomy andhavedeveloped\\nvery differentformsofcapitalorganisation .Thesetwofactorsare\\nlinked.Thevitaleconomic andpoliticalplaceofcoal,steelandeven\\nshipbuilding was animportant consideration in their subsequent\\nnationalisation .Thechangeincapitalorganisation as a result of\\ndeclinewas very different intextilesandalthough therewas\\nconsiderable government intervention toorganise theprocessof\\ndecline the industries haveremained entirelywithinprivateowner\\xad\\nship. A furthercontrast arosefrom the sectors\\'different labour\\nprocesses andlabourrequirements.

Spatially, the Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 127\\ndecline has been accompanied byinterregional consolidation into\\nlarger units ofproduction , but the main changeinspatialstructure\\nhasconcerned ownership , withnationalisation andcentralised\\ncontrolreplacing privateand,often, regional ownership .\\nTheFifties: a wasted decade\\nThesecharacteristics of the United Kingdom\\'s economy, society\\nandgeography werereinforced duringthe fifties. The long post-war\\nboomoftheinternational capitalist economy allowed British\\nindustry tocoastalongwithoutthoughtof serious reorganisation.\\nAt thebeginning oftheperiod,Britishmanufactures stillaccounted\\nfor 25 per cent ofworldexports. But this decade was to see the\\nbeginning of the end ofthatposition. Thetraditional orientation of\\nthe\\'State and of important sectionsofcapitalcontinued . Politically\\nthere was more concern with Suez and with organising areasonably\\ndignified withdrawal from Empire, than with the domestic econo\\xad\\nmy. And British capitalinvested massively abroad.\\'Theopportu\\xad\\nnitiesthatBritain\\'s imperial tradingandfinancial connections\\nprovided led to the development after1950ofsome vast and very\\nsuccessful international businesses\\' (Gamble, 1981, p. 113). The\\nworld vision ofsectionsofmanufacturing capitalwas thus rein\\xad\\nforced, and the conflict between the interests ofinternationalised\\nindustry and finance, and the requirements ofthedomestic econo\\xad\\nmy wasexacerbated. Little was donetoupdateproduction within\\nthe United Kingdom itself.Moreover , extensive expansion drew\\nheavily on domestic suppliesoflabour.Immigration provided extra\\nworkers, butthatsourcetoo began to be cutback with the\\nincreasing restrictions from the early sixties on. The fifties were a\\ndecade when the complacent claimthatwe had never had it so good\\ntemporarily concealed the fact ofyawning structural weaknesses.\\nMuch the same complacent inactivity appliedalso toquestions of\\ngeography . In the fifties regional inequality did not figure promi\\xad\\nnently on the political agenda.Throughout thatdecade the main\\nconcern expressed aboutgeographical differences wasthatthe\\ndifferential tightness ofregional labourmarkets mightcause\\n\\'overheating\\' in theeconomy as a whole. Itwasreasoned thatthe\\nstrengthoflabourin the relatively full-employment regionsofthe\\nsouth-east andmidlands ofEngland, combined withnational\\nbargaining structures, would push up wages to a level above what 128SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncouldhave been won hadunemployment beenmoreevenly\\ndistributed aboutthecountry. Theargument seems never to have\\ncarriedsufficient political weight to get an active regionalpolicyoff\\ntheground. This omission was akin to British capital\\'s tardiness in\\nupdating itsproduction techniques , and it too was to have serious\\nconsequences . Itshouldbe noted, to begin with, thatthe lack of\\nregional policy was in no way a reflection ofwhatwashappening to\\nregionalinequality. Differences in unemployment levelswere in fact\\nquitehighduringthe fifties. Absolute levelsofunemployment,\\nhowever, except for those in Northern Ireland, were low, with the\\nold basic industries enjoying for much ofthe decade a relative\\nboom. The low absolute levels seem to have had more political\\neffectthanthe relatively high levels ofdisparity, and\\'theregional\\nquestion\\' was not a majorpolitical issue. This relative quiescence,\\ncombined with aConservative government committed todecontrol,\\nresulted in almosta decade of virtualinaction, a passivity broken\\nonly by the occasional ad hoc.andsometimes ill-judged, interven\\xad\\ntion in direct response to social pressure (seeBoardofTrade,\\n1955-6). The decision to split investment in a steel stripmillproject\\nbetween Llanwern insouthWalesandRavenscraig inScotland was\\nsuch a political response. In this way, the rest ofthe long boom, the\\nperiodwhichprovided themostpropitious conditions for a\\nsuccessful regional policy, was wasted. IndeedasHudson (1982)\\namplydemonstrates, there were clear decisions nottoattractjobs\\nfor men to the north-east, for fearoflosinglabourfrom the mines.\\nThesubsequent periodofactive regional policy has been conducted\\nunderconditions ofmanufacturing employment decline.Forthe\\nendofthe longboombroughtwith it also the returnoftheregional\\nproblem.\\nThe cracks begin to show\\nBy the early sixties the long-term weakness ofthe British economy\\nwasclear.Theset-back ofthelatefiftieshadgiven the first\\nintimations, the recession of1957revealed the vulnerability of\\nbasic sectors, and by the early sixties it was irrefutable - every\\nindicator ofgrowthandcompetitiveness was on the slide. The\\ninternational capitalist economy washeaving itselfintoa new\\nposition, a new international division oflabourwasasserting\\nitself, and the British economy wasbothchanging its role and\\nlosing out. Some ChangingSpatial Structures in the UK 129\\nInemployment terms, 1966was the turningpoint.It was in that\\nyearthatmanufacturing employment began to decline, notjust\\nrelatively, as a proportion oftotalemployment in theeconomy, but\\nin termsofthetotalnumberofjobsitprovided. And since 1966the\\ndecline has continued, with only occasional and very briefperiods\\nofgrowth.Itwasaroundthe mid-sixties, too, thatunemployment\\nbegan to shift upwards to a level markedly higherthanthatabout\\nwhich it had oscillated for most oftheperiodsince the Second\\nWorld War. Even before 1966, ofcourse, many majorsectors of the\\neconomy were declining in employment terms.Agriculture , mining,\\nmetalmanufacture, shipbuilding, textiles,clothing,transport... all\\nhad been losing jobssince well before the mid-sixties. Indeed,\\nproduction industries as a whole were showing employment decline.\\nBut in 1966 manyoftheindustries associated withpost-war growth\\nbegan to employ fewer people - the SIC Ordersoffood,drinkand\\ntobacco, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering ,construc\\xad\\ntion, gas, electricity and water, and the distributive trades.The\\ngroupsymbolises the building andconsumer boomof the fifties.\\nBetween 1966 and 1979 otherindustries followed, equallysymbo\\xad\\nlically - instrument engineering and public administration. By the\\nendofthe 1970s insurance, banking andfinance, professional\\nservices and miscellaneous services, were the only SIC Ordersstill\\nregistering a net increase in employment.\\nIthas,ofcourse, beenadeclinewhichhasvariedinintensity\\nbetween different partsofthe economy. The old basic sectors,and\\nmechanical and electrical engineering-based means-of-production\\nindustries, declined the fastest, while some consumer andproducer\\nservicescontinued toexpandemployment for much oftheperiod.\\nThe decline has also varied in nature, being morecombined with\\ninvestment and technical change in the early partof theperiod,\\nmoredominated by simple cut-back at the end (Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982). But, in one way or another, employment decline\\nhas been important throughout the period.\\nThe decline in production industries is not,ofcourse,peculiarto\\nBritain.Itistakingplace in most industrialised capitalist countries,\\nand the diminishing proportion ofemployment inmanufacturing is\\na reflection oflong-term and generalised changes in thelabour\\nprocess and the division oflabour.Theabsolute decline in the\\nnumberof people employed in manufacturing is alsocommon to a\\nlargenumberofcountries .Thefactthatthisgeneralised downturn\\ntookplaceratherearlierinBritainthanelsewhere, and thatit has 130SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nbeenmoresevere, is a reflection ofthelong-term structural\\nweaknesses in British economy and society. In the contextofa\\nshiftinginternational divisionoflabourand,later, aslowdown in\\nthe world capitalist economy as a whole, these structural weak\\xad\\nnesses came home to roost.\\nIt was all this thatlay behind the decline. The crises in major\\nsectionsoftheeconomy have been accompanied by aheightened\\nconflictofinterest,if not always explicit conflict, between different\\nsectionsofsociety, and particularly betweencapitalandlabour.As\\nonprevious occasions , too, a shift in international position has had\\nits moredetailedreflection in the internalgeography ofthecountry.\\nMuchofthe restofthebookconcerns precisely this.\\n* * *One thing can be notedbriefly now: the periodsince the mid-1960s\\nhas been very different from the shift in the international order\\nwhichovertook theUnitedKingdom in the early decades ofthis\\ncentury. Inparticular itcontrasts with the thirties.Forthis is a\\ndifferent kind of changeinBritain\\'s place in the world. In the\\nthirtiesthe final end of economic dominance was signalled by the\\nheadlong collapse ofa small numberofparticular, thoughvery\\nmajor,primary andsecondary sectors. Since the 1960s it has not\\nbeen the end oftheEmpirewhich has been at issue, but more\\ngenerally the UnitedKingdom as amanufacturing economy. The\\ndeclinehas been far morewidespread, encompassing mostof\\nmanufacturing industry, and it has also had a different geogra\\xad\\nphy. The decline oftheindustries on which imperial dominance was\\nbuiltdragged down whole regions with it, butit leftotherpartsof\\nthecountry, notably themidlands andthesouthandeastof\\nEngland, relatively intact.This time the patternis different. The\\nverygenerality ofmanufacturing decay means thatfew areas have\\nescaped entirely. But it is the old manufacturing specialists which\\nhave,inevitably, beenhardesthit - the north-west ofEngland, and\\nthe west midlands. In theperiodsince the early sixties the latter\\nregion has plummeted down the regional rankings. Ithas left the\\ncore and joinedtheperiphery, indeed the whole line between the\\ntwo has been redrawn. Over this period,too, it has become clear\\nthatthe old \\'regional\\' level (in the formalsenseofStandard\\nRegions) is less and less relevant for drawing mapsofindustrial\\nchange,orcharting relativeprosperity and decline. Fromthe mid\\xad\\n1960sto the mid-1970s the biggest disparities inemployment decline\\nwere not interregional but between the cities and the non-conurba- SomeChanging SpatialStructures in the UK 131\\ntion areas (Fothergill andGudgin, 1979; Keeble, 1980). The cities\\nhave suffered heavily, and for a whole range ofreasons.Ithas not\\nprimarily been a result of the concentration thereofoldindustries,\\nthoughthis has had some partto play.Ithasratherbeen because\\nthe cities tendedto have the olderandmorelabour-intensive\\ncapacity within any sector,andweretherefore more liable to suffer\\nfromprogrammes ofcapacity-cutting andtechnical change,and\\nfrom the fact thatwhatnewinvestment wasavailable soughtout the\\nattractions oflessurbanareas.The decline in the cities, bothwithin\\nDevelopment Areas(Newcastle, Merseyside, Clydeside) andin the\\nnon-assisted areas(London, Coventry), hasagaintherefore notjust\\nbeen a simple parallelofthe thirties; the economic changesto which\\nthis decline is a response aredifferent fromthoseoffifty years ago.\\nButjobloss in the old basic industries oftheDevelopment Areas\\nhascontinued at a high rate, although unevenly, throughout the\\nperiod.In coal, in steel andinshipbuilding, huge declines in\\nemployment havetakenplace. As we shall see, this process has\\nbeen of fundamental importance in the whole wider patternof\\ngeographical changeinindustry as a whole. Ithasenabled the\\ncreation ofabrandnew reserve of labour,a reserve which has\\nfunctioned indifferent ways atdifferent timesandindifferent parts\\nof theeconomy . Thecontinuing declineofthe basic sectorshas also\\nremained a keycomponent of political relations,againchanging in\\nitsnaturebutalmostalways being significant.\\n* * *Theperiodsince the early 1960s, then, has been characterised by\\nnational-level economic declineandstagnation, apersistent regional\\nproblem, aninability torethinkthe conflict between a traditional\\ninternational orientation and the presentpressing needsofthe\\ndomestic economy , and along-term classstalemate. But it has not\\nbeen astaticstalemate , anequilibrium . On the contrary, theperiod\\nsince the early sixties has seen a shiftingsearch for a solution at the\\npolitical level. Different political alliances have been constructed, a\\nvarietyofstrategies have been tried, andregional policy and spatial\\npolicies more generally have risen andfallen intheirimportance and\\nchanged anumber oftimes in theirnature.Theaimofthe\\nremaining chapters is to use this period,beginning in the early\\n1960s, to explore andillustrate someoftheconcepts andthe\\napproach outlined in the first halfof thisbook.Threedifferent\\nslices are takenthrough theproblem. The rest ofthischapter\\nexamines changes in anumberofindustrial sectors; Chapter 5 132SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ntakes aspatially-defined focus and looks at the impactofthese\\nchanges in specific areas, and Chapter 6 examines variations over\\ntime.\\nTheremainder ofthischapter, then, explores the changing spatial\\nstructures ofa fewmajorsectors of the economy . Eachsectorhas\\nbeen affected by the shiftingeconomic andpolitical circumstances\\noftheperiod,but each has been affected in different ways. The\\nresponses have likewise been different. The pointofthediscussions\\nisnottopresentdatabut toreconceptualise it. Each discussion\\nstartsfrom an SIC definition ofapartoftheeconomy andexplores\\nwhatdifferent kindsofcapitaloperatewithin it. Each startsfrom\\nchangesinemployment patternand asks what spatialstructures of\\ntherelations ofproduction underlie these patterns.Whatis at issue\\nis the way in which contrasting sectionsofBritishcapitalhave been\\nreorganising themselves intonewspatialstructures, eachofwhich\\nforms the basis for new kinds ofgeographical differentiation, and\\nwhichtogether are animportant element in the changing intrana\\xad\\ntionalspatialdivisionoflabour.\\n4.2 Electronics and instruments industries\\nThe character ofthe industry\\nThegroupofproducts classified underthegeneralheading of\\n\\'electronics\\'has been a focus of growththroughout thepost-war\\nperiod.Evenafterthe mid-sixties employment in this field in the\\nUnitedKingdom continued toexpandquiterapidly,thoughby the\\nearly 1980s there was job-losseven here. Nonethe less the size of\\ntheindustry inemployment terms, and its relatively fast growth,\\nmeansthatit has been a significant elementshapingthechanging\\nindustrial geography oftheUnitedKingdom over much of the\\nperiod.Itis also an industry which has gained world-wide notoriety\\nbothsocially and spatially. Socially for the enormous contrasts\\nwhich it encompasses, from the jet-setting microchip scientist/\\ninventor/entrepreneur, male and flying Ambassador Class, to the\\nyoungassembler ofsemiconductors, female, paid around20 cents\\nanhour(in the 1970s), andlikely to lose her jobin acoupleof years,\\nif thecompany hasanywaynotmoved on by then, as her eyesight\\nfails.

Itdoesn\\'tjuststretch, it is\\ndeliberately spaced, from Palo Alto, California , to theMasanFree\\nProduction Zone,SouthKorea.\\nThis is an international spatialstructure, oneofthe classic\\ncornerstones of the new international divisionoflabour.And it is\\nwithinthatoverallcontextthatthespatialorganisation ofthe\\nelectronics industry inanyone country mustbe set. It is an\\ninternational divisionoflabourwhich has only really takenshape\\nsince the 1960s. \\'Itwas not until 1966 ...thatworldmanufacturers\\nbegan to appreciate theadvantage ofusingKorea\\'sabundance of\\ncheap, diligent labour\\'(TheTimes.26September 1975;quotedin\\nFroebel,Heinrichs andKreye, 1980). Since then, each .national\\ngeographical structure has reflected in its own reorganisation this\\nmassivereorientation ofworldproduction .\\n* * *In the United Kingdom, the initial post-war growthofthegroupof\\nindustries known as \\'electronics\\' wasoverwhelmingly concentrated\\nin thesouth-east especially in GreaterLondon, with asubcentre in\\nthenorth-west ofEngland, primarily aroundtheManchester region.\\nAs late as 1959, the earliest datefor which precise figures are\\navailable, over 60 per cent of jobsin theindustry were in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, with the north-west trailing second with 8\\nper cent (Keeble, 1976). Such sectoralconcentration mirrored that\\nofotherindustries in the same period,and waspartofthepatternof\\nregionaldifferentiation basedprimarily onsectoraldifference. Since\\nthen, this patternhas begun to change,primarily intraregionally but\\nalsointerregionally . While the south-east\\'s sharehas fallen only\\nslightly,otherregions, in particular Scotland, have increased theirs.\\nWithin regions, and particularly within the south-east, there has\\nbeenmarkeddecentralisation (Keeble, 1976). While London\\'s share\\nhas slumped, stretches of theoutermetropolitan area and beyond\\nhave witnessed majorgrowth,bothabsolutely and relatively. Two\\nareasofmajorexpansion since the fifties have been the New Towns\\nofScotland andtheareabetween London,Southampton and\\nBristol. But a wide range ofotherareas, from the coalfields of\\nsouthWales to the coastalresortsofthesouth-west, experienced\\nsomeexpansion .\\nBehind these descriptive statistics lies arestructuring of British\\nelectronics in the contextofworld-wide reorganisation, and a shift\\nin theindustry\\'s useofthe British space. While employment\\ncontinued to grow through the sixties and much ofthe seventies 134SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ntheindustry none the less faced fiercer competition internationally\\nfrom the mid-1960s onwards. Whole sections ofit came under\\npressure to cut costs. The increasing vulnerability, particularly in\\nthecapitalgoodssections, brought apolitical as weIl as an\\neconomic response. The importance ofthispartoftheeconomy\\nbothinincreasing productivity over theeconomy as a whole and in\\nbeing\\'thenewtechnology \\' gave it a political centrality which,\\nalthough it varied greatly in importance ,remained throughout the\\nperiod.Stateintervention ,exhortation and aid were important now\\nin thefurtherevolution oftheindustry,justas they had been in its\\nbirth. Thiscombination ofincreased competitive pressure andState\\naid had a dual effect. First,itencouraged , over the late sixties in\\nparticular ,changes in thestructure andorganisation ofcapital.\\nOwnership wasconsolidated and there was a significant increase in\\nthe sizeofthemajorindividual companies . This in turnenabledthe\\nfinancing ofthe second development: anacceleration oftechnolo\\xad\\ngical change within the production process itself, in response to the\\nincreased pressure to cut costs and especiaIly to increase labour\\nproductivity. Together with the development ofnewproducts and\\ntypesofcomponents, this led to increases in the importance of\\nstandardisation andofmass-production. These were not brandnew\\nchanges. They were reinforcements of existing processes (long-term\\ntechnolog icalchange; the rise in importance ofcommodities and\\ncomponents which could be produced bymass-production techni\\xad\\nques), but as a result ofchanged economic conditions they became\\nmoreimportant.\\nNorwerethesechanges characteristic ofthewholeofthe\\nelectronics industry. The word \\'electronics\\' refers to the technologi\\xad\\ncalnatureofthecommodity produced, but thecharacter ofcapital\\nengaged in thatproduction varies widely. To begin with, there are\\ndifferences of product andofplace in the economy. \\'Electronics\\'\\ncovers the range from militaryequipment throughcomputers for use\\ninadvanced production processes to TV games. These differences are\\nmirrored inothers.Militaryelectronics andadvanced computers are\\nat thefront-end oftechnological development, heavilyresearch\\xad\\norientated ,fast-changing and with an emphasis on theunstandar\\xad\\ndised.At theotherend, the manufacture bothofconsumer\\nelectronics andofcomponents such as integrated circuitsand\\nsemiconductors is geared towardslarge-scale mass-production and\\nuniformity. Itis not,though,justaquestion ofproduct. Thereare\\nalsootherconsiderable contrasts between firms \\'in electronics\\'.

At theotherendofthe spec\\xad\\ntrum,thedistribution ofhighly-trained andhighly-paid technical\\nandscientific workers wasofincreasing locational significance.\\nThequestion ofwhodoeswhatjobin thepresentorganisation of\\ntheelectronics industryhas been firmly answered, as has the social\\nstatuswhich is deemed to goalongwith each, statusinsideand\\noutsidetheworkplacereinforcing eachothertoproduce a rigidly\\nhierarchised social system ofproduction.Thetechnical ,research\\nanddevelopment workisoverwhelmingl ydonebygraduates : it is 136SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nalso,although this is in no way required by thenatureof thejob,\\nalmostalwaysdoneby men.

This is usually arguedto be a result\\nof therequirements ofproduction becauseofwomen\\'s supposedly\\ngreater\\'dexterity\\' . \\'Aspokesman fromInmosadmitted recently\\nthatthecompany wouldbeoffering \"thesortofdetailed, fiddly\\njobsthataretraditionally doneby women: they have a special\\naptitude forthatkind of work\\'\" (Marks, 1980). As Markspoints\\nout,\\'Female workers come at special prices too\\'. Ifdexterity really\\nis the issue it seems surprising thatnotmorewomenget to do the\\ndetailed, fiddlyjobofbrainsurgery.Itis not, in the end, much to\\ndo with the requirements ofproduction in atechnical sense; it is\\nmuch more to do with the fact thatwho does whatjobispartand\\nparcel of the reproduction ofsocialstructures in society as a whole.\\nMuchthe same applies to the low skill statusattached toelectronics\\nassembly .WalkerandStorper (1982) argue thatsemiconductor\\nassembly skills are often objectively higher thanthoserequired in\\ncar assembly. Whatisdifferent aboutthelabourprocessisthatthe\\ntasks are less technically interdependent andhighturnover conse\\xad\\nquentlyless of a preoccupation withmanagement.

The high levels ofturnover combine\\nwith the lack ofunionattention to women workers\\' statustoensure\\nthatthe official skill definition of the work will remainlow.\\nEachofthesepartsofthelabourforce -different socialgroups\\xad\\noperates indifferent ways as a \\'location factor\\'; the way it affects Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 137\\nthelocationofindustry isdifferent in each case.

Thispartof thelabourforce\\nisoverwhelmingly concentrated in theoutermetropolitan areaof\\nthesouth-east ofEngland, stretching intoHampshire, EastAnglia\\nand west towards Bristol. Buswell and Lewis (1970) showedthatin\\n1968, 63 per cent of electronics engineers in theUnitedKingdom\\nlived in the south-east ofEngland.Thereareotherclusters, notably\\ninnorthCheshire, and in the Edinburgh area,but by far the largest\\nconcentration of these social stratawas inEngland\\'s \\'sunbelt\\'.Itis\\nalso to this areaaboveallthattheRand0partofelectronics has\\ngravitated. Theinteresting question is \\'why?\\' Whatliesbehindthis\\nclustering and the choice of these particular locations?\\nThereappearsfor thispartofthelabourforce to be an intimate\\nandmutually-reinforcing relation between location andsocial\\nstatus.Industries cometo these partsofthecountry, cluster\\nbetween the Solent andtheCotswolds, becausethatis where these\\npeopleare.Thereareotherreasons, too, which we shall take up in\\nlaterchapters, but the simple presence of these partsof thelabour\\nforce isofimmense importance . This is not, though, amiddle-class\\nequivalent oftakingwork to the workers, believed to be a social\\nprinciple behindregional policy. These workers are highly mobile;\\nthey are not stuck,norare they moving aboutthecountryin search\\nofemployment.

Thislabourmarketdoes not operatein\\ntermsofsimpleavailability, ofnumerical supply and demand.

Thenatureofcompetition in theseindustries reinforces\\nthe significance of this. Firmscompete through technology and\\nthroughquality,innovation and new products, at least as much as\\nthrough price.Whatis being boughton thelabourmarketisnot\\njustlabourpowerbut scientific knowledge. Poaching between\\ncompanies iscommon. \\'Some... hightechnology companies . . .\\nhaveattempted to tie up their expert employees with contracts that\\npreventthem from competing with their employer for several years\\nafterthey leave\\' (Kehoe, 1982a). Legal battlesarequitecommon.\\nThis, then, is a highly differentiated labourmarketcreating a\\ndynamic ofcompetition in which it is necessary for bothsides,\\nemployer and employee, to have detailedknowledge of themarket;\\nto be in on the scene.

On the whole,\\nwages are higher,the degree oftradeunionorganisation stronger\\nand things such as absenteeism lower where such workers have less\\nhistoryofemployment incapitalist wagerelations. Thereare\\ntherefore locational advantages , so far as access to this kind of\\nlabourisconcerned, where there are reserves ofnewworkers\\ncomingon to the capitalist labourmarketfor the first time.

Theimportant characteristic ofthislatterpart\\nofproduction, however, is thatit isdeclining. Investment in the new\\ntechnology nolongerrequires suchlocations; being freed from its\\nprevious ties to skilled labour,newinvestment can now be made in\\nthe\\'bottom-rung \\' regions ofthehierarchy .Thisprocessisspeeded\\nup because ofthe overall lack ofgrowth, for even while industry\\ncontinues toupdateitstechniques in the face ofincreasingly severe\\ncompetition, itcannotaffordin many cases to expanditsoutput\\nsignificantly.

This is the experimental/developmental\\nfirst stage ofproduction ofa newproduct. It differs in a numberof\\nways from the production processes justdescribed . It isnot\\ndeclining, for it is at the new end ofthe process oftechnological\\nchange. Moreover, thelabourrequirements areratherdifferent.\\nMuchofthelaboursoughtmay in fact be ofthe assembly-line,\\nsemi-skilled type, but precisely because this is an experimental stage\\nofproduction there is a requirement also for skilled labour,and the\\nskillsrequired will benotonlyofthe\\'old-fashioned\\' engineering\\ntype but also new technical skills. This difference in labourtype\\ncombines -with the need for contactwith centres ofRandD to\\ninfluence the location ofsuch facilities. Such production is then,\\nveryfrequently, in or close to the \\'top-end\\' regions of the hierarchy.\\nFinally, these top-end regions themselves are defined by the\\nlocation within them oftheupperechelons of all the hierarchies.\\nTheyinclude thetopmanagerial staffwiththeirassociated\\nfunctions ofownership and overall control, theRandDworkers\\nwith their functions ofconceptualisation, and the early develop\\xad\\nmental stages oftheproduction process itself, including assembly,\\ncraftand technical workers. As we have seen, within the United\\nKingdom thisconstellation offunctions and social strataoccurs\\nabove all in the southand eastofEngland, withoutliersparticularly\\nin thenorthCheshire area(southofManchester) and in the south\\xad\\neastofScotland, especially aroundEdinburgh.\\nAll these spatialstructures ofbig firms in electronics shareone\\nfeature, the locational separation ofresearch from production . Such\\nseparation is not always simply a response to highly differentiated\\nlocational requirements .Spatialstructures areestablished through\\nsocial processes. In the early days ofelectronics many firms with a\\nlonghistoryin electrical engineering, staidandworthyin their own\\nfields but nonetheless on a loser, tried to keep abreastofthe times\\nby moving into electronics . Suchcompanies had well established\\nstructures, theirpersonnel were set in their ways, and the new\\ngrowthwas seen as potentially disruptive . Inpartthis was precisely\\nbecause it wasgrowing, and at the expense oftheelectrical\\nengineers, andinpartit wasbecause thewholeethoswas Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 143\\ndifferent; old-time engineers facedelectronics whizz-kids. The\\nanswerto the social problem wasoftenspatialseparation. Burns\\nandStalker(1961)document manysuch cases (one, indeed,where\\nspatialseparation wasreduced to the effective andtellingsymbo\\xad\\nlism ofbuilding a brick wall through theplant!)in theScottish\\nindustry of the 1950s.

The solution, again, has often been spatialseparation .\\n\\'The way outofthesetroubleswas seen by the headsoffirms to liein\\nseparating the new groupas far as possible, administratively and\\nphysically, from the existing establishment.

Some non-UK firms have only production facilities\\nhere,American firms in Scotland for example, and German and\\nJapanese companies in Wales. The orientation ofthedifferent\\nregions reflects the international position too. While partsofthe\\nsouth-east try tocompete with Silicon Valley the regions with only\\nassembly jobsmay loseeven them to a ThirdWorldFreeProduction\\nZone, or win production back only when there has been sufficient\\nautomation to reduce substantially thecriticalimportance oflabour\\ncosts, and therefore thenumberofjobs. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 145\\nSpatial structures ofsmallfirms\\nBut not all firms, by any means, could adoptthis kind ofspatial\\nstructure. There is within the electronics and instruments industries\\na range of companies which are different in two crucial respects\\nfrom those so far discussed: in the character of the capital involved\\nand in the nature ofthedominant labourprocess. These companies\\nare small, often entrepreneurial operations, and they do not on the\\nwhole use mass-production techniques. These two closely-linked\\naspects-capitalorganisation andlabourprocess-together\\ncondition a locational strategy which is very different from the\\nspatialstructures just described, but which none the less reinforces\\nsome of their regional effects.\\nThis is, parexcellence .smallcapitaloftheventuresome,\\nadvanced-technology variety. In spite ofits size it operates in an\\ninternational scene. Its smallness is partly a reflection of the nature\\nofthelabourprocess. Much production ofinstruments and\\nadvanced electronics takes place on a small-batch basis, is labour\\nintensive, and is geared to competition based less on cost than on\\ntechnological characteristics. Production is often for specialised\\nmarkets, often on the basis of customer specification, and requires\\ndevelopment ofandadaptation to acontinually changing technol\\xad\\nogy. There are few opportunities formass-production and fewalso\\nforeconomiesofscale.\\nLabourrequirements clearly reflect these characteristics. Soft\\xad\\nwarescientists, microchip people and technologists are very\\nimportant. Manualworkers, too, tend to be specialised and highly\\nskilled, and the most significant aspect of this skill is adaptability.\\nThe work is non-repetitive, with a high degree of on-the-job\\ncontrol.\\nAll this determines a veryparticular setofconstraints on\\nlocation. The small size of the firms means thatit is difficult to\\nlocate research and production separately. The frequent one-offor\\nsmall-batch character cuts down on the possibilities for mass\\xad\\nproduction and requires a much more intimate relation between\\nresearch, development and operations on the shop floor. These\\nthings together immediately rule out a spatial structure of the\\nmultiregional, hierarchical, part-process variety. These companies\\nare single-region affairs and usually also single-location. Further,\\nthedemand for skilled labourrestricts the range of possible\\nlocations, concentrating themparticularly , and once again, in the 146SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nsouth-east of England. This applies not only to the research kind of\\nskilledlabourbut also to the technically skilled shop-floor workers,\\nwho often do jobs which precisely involve the integration of\\nconception and execution (Oakey, 1978) .5Some evidence indicates\\nthat,although thesouth-east does not in fact always have slacker\\nmarketsfor such labour,it is often nonetheless perceived to be a\\nbetterregion for bothskilled operative and administrative labour\\n(Oakey, p. 207).The resulting concentration of these firms thus\\nreinforces the region\\'s existing dominance in the distribution of\\nskilled and technical workers. And numerous studies show thatthis\\ndifferential distribution of \\'key workers\\' is real as wellas perceived.\\nOne of the cases Oakey presents is of a small company (about150\\nworkers) which was trying to concentrate a previous hierarchically\\xad\\nstructured location pattern.Whatis more, it was attempting\\nconsolidation in the lower end of the hierarchy, in a Development\\nArea. A manufacturing plant at Camberley, Surrey, which had 20\\nper cent of the organisation\\'s totalmanufacturing, and all the\\ncompany\\'s administration and research and development facilities,\\nwas closed in 1977, and the activities moved to an existing\\nproduction plant at Runcorn. The Runcorn planthad been in\\noperation since1968on a new government-built factory estate and\\nhad previously had 80 per cent of the company\\'s production, but\\nalmost no administration (p.275).\\nThe decision to consolidate on the Runcorn site was governed by\\ntwofactors- thesmallerdisruption toproduction and the\\navailability of regional policy assistance. But problems arose in\\nattracting skilledlabour.First, only a small proportion ofthe\\n\\'highly skilled technical and administrative staffcould be per\\xad\\nsuaded to move north. Second, \\'a shortage of \"local scientific\\nengineering and skilled manpower\" (questionnaire response) that\\nhad been present since the Runcorn plant\\'sinitialestablishment in\\n1968,havingintensified since the Camberley relocation, had\\nvirtually forced the company to close the Runcorn plant\\'(p.276).\\nThe plant did survive - with the help oftheTemporary Employ\\xad\\nment Subsidy - but the example illustrates well the kinds of\\nconditions which might keep in the south-east boththatpartof\\nthese industries which requires predominantly skilled and technical\\nlabour,andthatpartwhich consists of firms which, though they\\nmay have some processes performed by semi-skilled labour,are too\\nsmall to establish a hierarchical spatial structure. No mention is\\nmadeofanyattempts by firms to train their own labour. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 147\\nThis, however, is an example ofanattempted move to the\\nindustrial periphery .Thereis more evidence ofsuccessful moves\\nby such firms to the ruralregionsbordering thesouth-east, and in\\nparticular thesouth-west ofEngland andEast Anglia. In these\\nregions the environmental preferences ofmanagerial and technical\\nstaffare more likely to be met (Spooner, 1972;Cornwall Industrial\\nDevelopment Association, 1977).Indeed,oneofthecomplaints in\\nthesouth-west isthattoo many ofthesejobsare taken by in\\xad\\nmigrants -thoughclearly there are exceptions even here (see\\nNote5). The evidence is, however, thateven in these regions such\\nmovesprovideonly aminority ofincoming employment, the bulk\\nof it being production work inbranchplants.Moreover ,although\\nresidential preference has been important inattracting such firms to\\nthe regions it has not saved them from a faster-than-average closure\\nrate in recent years (Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b;Cornwall\\nIndustrial Development Association, 1977).\\nThispartoftheindustry bears witness againto the negative\\nsocialpoweroverlocation of\\'thebeststaff\\'. They could not be\\npersuaded to go to Runcorn, and in St Austell there was a lack of\\nartisticandcultural entertainments : theinterpenetration ofthe\\neconomic and the social again. Whathasartisticentertainment got\\nto do with makingaprofitinelectronics? It is not a demandofthe\\nproduction process directly. But the technology being developed in\\nelectronics is based on a division oflabourwhichincreasingly\\nseparates conceptualisation fromexecution, and the social polarisa\\xad\\ntion with which this is associated is inpartthecondition for, and in\\npartreinforced by,ideological factorswhich go far beyond\\nproduction. The kinds ofsocialstratawhich occupy the top end\\nofbothmanagerial andproduction -technology hierarchies in these\\nindustries have been centralto therhetoricofeconomic strategy\\nthroughout theperiodsince the sixties, thoughin vastly varying\\nways. In the sixties they were the linchpin oftheState-backed white\\nheatoftechnological, andmanagerial, revolution. By the eighties\\nthey were transformed, at least ideologically, intothedynamic\\nentrepreneurs (thetwo-men-in-a-garage), towhatwould be left\\nwhen the dead wood ofBritishindustry (andStateintervention)\\nhad been cut away, when they would have space to breathe,expand,\\nand save the economy . Inbothguises they manifestly failed, but\\ntheir social statusremained untarnished . Thedevelopment ofa\\nparticular social form and ideology ofthetechnology ofproduction\\nis theprecondition for aparticular formofgeographical differ- 148SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nentiation. Equally, geographical form itselfcan help to reinforce the\\nsocial divisiveness of a division of labourwithinproduction.\\nAs itstandsatpresent, then, the spatialstructure most\\ncharacteristic of this kind of smaller company is that of geographi\\xad\\ncalconcentration . All stages of production as wellas of ownership\\nandmanagement are in general to be found in one area. And being\\nable neither to establish a hierarchical spatial structure nor to\\ndecentralise the whole of production they were unable to take the\\nsameadvantage of the existing form of geographical inequality.\\nClearly, therefore, it is not possible to generalise aboutthe spatial\\nstructures ofthetechnologically-advanced/means-of-production\\npartsofthe economy. For these firms, the characteristics of the\\nlabourprocess and oftheorganisation of capital were far more\\nimportant determinants of locational structure.\\nNevertheless, this spatial structure reinforces, although it does\\nnot replicate, the patternofspatialdifferentiation implied by the\\nlocational hierarchies of production characteristic ofotherpartsof\\nelectronics and related industries. Itreinforces the concentration of\\nsupply and demand for particular kinds of skilled labourin the\\nsouthand east, and it reinforces the concentration of ownership,\\nandofuppermanagement andcontrol, in the same area. The\\nlocational structure ofsuch firms thus contributes further to the\\nreproduction ofthe differential distribution withinGreatBritain\\nboth of capital itself and of its immediate representatives , and of\\nelements of those stratawhich Wright places between the working\\nclass and the petty bourgeoisie.\\n4.3 Clothingandfootwear\\nThe character ofthe industry: increasing pressures\\nEmployment in the clothing and footwear industry in the United\\nKingdom has been declining for decades. This is an old industry,\\ngrown out of domestic production of essential consumer goods,\\nrising tonationalsignificance in the nineteenth century, to undergo\\nsince the Second World War, and especially since the 1960s, a\\nradical shift in location away from industrialised capitalist countries\\nof the first world. Itisan industry which wasearly in, and has been\\ncentral to, the emergence of a new international division of labour.\\nThedramatic decline in employment has not prevented, however, Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 149\\ntheevolution ofnewspatialstructures within the UnitedKingdom .\\nIndeed, the pressures which have brought aboutdecline also lie\\nbehind those new structures. Decline is not necessarily a process of\\nstagnation orofsimple closure; it can also involve quite dramatic\\nreorganisation.\\n\\'Clothing\\', then, is a very different industry, with a very different\\nhistory and place in the economy, from those we have looked at so\\nfar. These contrasts meanthatfirms in the clothing industry are\\nsubject to different economic pressures and also adoptdifferent\\nlocational strategies .Descriptively, thegeographical patternof\\nemployment inclothing and the present changes in thatpattern\\nare well known and undisputed. The decline in jobs(thoughnot in\\noutput)islong-term ,thoughvarying in pace. The geographical\\nchanges are again long-term, but they accelerated between the mid\\n1960s and early 1970s. The mainshifts have been from the\\ntraditional centresofLondon, WestYorkshire andManchester\\ntowards both rural areas and peripheral regions. The change can\\nthus be described on two axes: on the one handfrommajorurban\\nareastowardssmaller towns and rural partsofthecountry; and on\\ntheotherfromnon-Development Areastowards Development\\nAreas.\\nThis, however, is justadescription ofthetwo-dimensional\\npattern.Whatlies behind it is a complicated setofchanges, both\\nin theorganisational structure ofcapitaland in the relations\\nbetween capital and labour.\\nInorderto examine this furtherit is necessary to look first at the\\ncharacteristics ofcapitalin thisindustry.Forthe\\'Clothing and\\nFootwear\\' OrderoftheStandard Industrial Classification is a\\nclassic case where, because they produce the same kind ofoutput,\\nvery different kinds of firms are aggregated together underone\\nheading. In terms oftheorganisation ofcapital,thenatureof\\nproduction relations andmanagement, and therelationto technol\\xad\\nogy and to the market,theclothing industry is split into a number\\nofdifferent parts. At least two significantly different kinds of\\ncapitaloperatewithin it.\\nAnimportant segmentoftheindustry is owned by small capital.\\nBut this is not the small capitalofelectronics and instruments\\nproduction . As in those sectors, the survival and importance of\\nsmallcompanies is inpartdue to the lack ofeconomies ofscale in\\nproduction . But in total contrast to theinstruments industry, this is\\nhere aresult,notofthecontinuously advancing natureof 150SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\ntechnology, butofthe fact thatit isbackward andrelatively\\nstagnant. The basic labourprocess in the clothing industry remains\\norganised around theindividually-operated sewingmachine \\xad\\nconveyor-belt production is stillunusual (NEOO, 1974a;Econo\\xad\\nmistsAdvisory Group,undated) .Although there are differences,\\nthiskindoflabourprocess isbroadly typicalthroughout the\\nindustry. The small firms, however, tend to be concentrated in\\nthosepartsofthesectorwhich are as yet least mechanisable and\\nwhere long runs and mass-production are rare. This varies both\\nbetween mlhs and between partsofthemarket(depending on the\\ndegreeof\\'fashion-orientation\\', etc.). The social natureofthese\\nfirms isdifferent too. Inclothing, small firms tend to be in rather\\nunentrepreneurial family-ownership and this in turnmeansthatthe\\ntechnological backwardness isreinforced by the\\'old-fashioned \\'\\nnatureof much ofthemanagement in theindustry. ANEOO\\nReportcommented thatit wasofacharacter tomanageacraft\\nindustryoflowtechnological content, smallcapitalinvestment and\\nshortturnover times, but thatanyattempt to raise-technological\\nlevelsand capitalintensity wouldcreate\\'largeproblems inmanage\\xad\\nmenteducation \\'(NEOO, 1974c).\\nAreporton thefootwear industry came to much the same\\nconclusion aboutthenatureofcapitalandmanagement there.\\nAgain in totalcontrast to themushrooming new firms in high-tech\\nsectors, firms in footwear tend to be old. \\'Very few new footwear\\ncompanies have been formed since the Second WorldWar and the\\nmajority ofthemedium andlargecompanies datefromthe\\nnineteenth century\\' (Economists Advisory Group,undated, p. 95).\\nThischaracteristic inturnhas resulted in a relatively high average\\nageofmanagements in family businesses, much of it in its secondor\\nthirdgeneration .\\'Anageingstructure ofenterprise andmanage\\xad\\nment is, it appears, a general characteristic ofUKindustry, but it\\nmay beexceptionally pronounced in thefootwear industry where, in\\nthenatureofthings,technological changehas been relatively slow\\'\\n(Economists Advisory Group,p. 95). This is for the industry as a\\nwhole, but there are clear divisions within it: \\'Thegeneralqualityof\\nmanagement in theindustry ispoorexcept in the few very large\\nmanufacturers where it is professional, trainedandcompetent\\'\\n(p. 130).

Theadvantages they gain from size are different.\\nCertainly, largefirmsaremorecommon in themore-easily\\nmechanisable partsoftheindustry, and where mass-production is\\nmorefeasible. They are, therefore, able to take some advantage of\\neconomies ofscale in production , but even in these partsofthe\\nsector(for example, shirtproduction) sucheconomies are relatively\\nlimited. The real advantages of size lie in the ability to dominate\\nmarketrelations, particularly with the distribution sector.\\nItisgenerally recognised thatthese two partsofthesector- small\\nfirmsandlarge - have behaved ratherdifferently in thepost-war\\nperiod, the former experiencing greaterdecline, the lattersome\\nexpansion andgreatermobility (primarily byestablishing new\\nbranchplantsin newlocations) .

However, because ofthesector\\'svery\\ndifferent structural position within the economy, the effects of these\\ndevelopments onclothing firms were not the same as the effects in\\nelectronics andinstruments. The recession hit different partsofthe\\neconomy in verydifferent ways.Over the long term, but particularly\\nsince the mid-I960s, the clothing industry has come underincreas\\xad\\ningpressure to cut its costs ofproduction .Mostobviously there has\\nbeencompetition fromimports (fromtheThirdWorld,from\\nComecon, from the UnitedStates) which couldout-compete the\\nproducts made in Britainlargely because they were cheaper.More\\xad\\nover, at the same time as the home markethas been invaded by\\nimports it has been slowing down in its overall rate ofgrowth\"\\n(reportsofClothing SectorEDC).

In the 1960s, this supply\\nwassupplemented byimmigration , but with political changes this\\nsourceofnewlabourbegan to diminish also(Winyard, 1977).

A study by the Clothing EDC,\\nreported on in 1980, foundlow pay to be the majorfactor\\ninfluencing peopleto leave the industry (NEDO, 1980), with\\nboredom coming second. Pay was particularly significant in\\nLondon - a reflection ofgeographical variation incompetition\\nforlabour. Thiscompares with an earlier study (NEDO, 1967) in\\nwhichboredom emerged as the single majorfactor. Wagecompeti\\xad\\ntion was relatively late on the scene. Indeed from the mid-1960s the\\ndisparity between wages for women in the clothing industry and in\\nmanufacturing as a whole increased dramatically .From98.4 per\\ncentofall-manufacturing average in 1965, women\\'s wages in\\nclothing fell to 89.4 per cent in 1970 and to 82.1 per cent in 1978\\n(Department ofEmployment data). This steep relative fall reflects\\ntheincreasing pressure on theindustry over this period; it also\\nreflects the ways in which capitalresponded. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 155\\nThe search fornew labour: two different strategies\\nThisresponse mirrored onceagainthe difference between large and\\nsmallcapitalin theindustry. The two behaved verydifferently .\\nManyvery small firms are more tied to the traditional andurban\\nareasofproduction, bothbecause they tend to bemoregearedinto\\nthe fashion end ofproduction (the existence ofwhich is itselfone of\\ntheconditions for the survival ofsmallcapitalin thesector)and,\\nmoreimportantly, because their very smallness andtheirfamily\\nnaturemeansthatthey are less able to respond tochanging cost\\npressures through geographical mobility. And it is precisely in the\\nurbanareaswhere these firms are concentrated thatthemost\\ndramatic increases in pressure on costs have takenplace(Depart\\xad\\nmentofTradeandIndustry, 1973; Keeble, 1976). Small capitalwas\\nthus often left stranded in the face of these rising costs - literally\\nimmobilised .Quitefrequently it gave up the ghost,anddied\\n(Keeble, 1976).\\nForthose small firms which survived it was necessary to reduce\\nlabourcosts while remaining in the same general location. Extensive\\nmechanisation andautomation wereimpossible ,bothbecausesuch\\nfirms did not have sufficient capitalorborrowing potential and\\nbecause such small firms are precisely concentrated in the less\\xad\\nmechanisable partsofthesector.Otherstrategies hadto be\\nadopted. The work process was intensified, thusincreasing its\\nspeed and also its monotony.\" Further, unableto escape from\\ntheseareasofincreasing competition forlabour, small firms turned\\nto more vulnerable sectionsofthelabourforce, in particular to\\nimmigrants andolderandmarried women, andformsoflabour\\norganisation such ashomeworking (which in the late seventies was\\nestimated , see King, 1981, p. 10, to account for 40 per centof\\nproduction inLondon, the highest level in the country) . This\\nreduced the bargaining powerof theworkforce andenabled the\\nemployers thus to hold down wages. Unabletochangelocation to\\nsearch for cheaperlabour,theyturnedtoothersocialstratain their\\nexisting areas and whatcame to be called \\'thenew sweated sector\\'\\ngrew up in London.!\"\\n* **\\nLargerfirms have been in a very different position, andable to\\nadopta verydifferent strategy.First,they were oftenbetterable to 156SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsurvive simply because ofthe extra financial resilience given to them\\nby size. Second, the fact thatthey tended to be in the more easily\\nmechanisable andautomatable partsof thesector, andthatthey\\nhad more capitalto invest, meantthatthey were more able than\\nwere small companies to reduce costs by technological changes in\\ntheproduction process. This allowed them bothto reduce the\\namountoflabourper unit ofoutputand to use the opportunity\\nofthechangeinproduction methodtointroduce cheaperworkers.\\nKing (1981) describes how technological innovation, byallowing\\nthereclassification ofjobs,enabledbetter-paid maleworkers to be\\n\\'boughtout\\'withredundancy payments and women to be employed\\nat a lower rate (Winyard , 1977; Disher, 1980). Such replacement\\nalsooperated between different groupsofwomenworkers. When\\nsearching outnewsourcesoffemalelabour,management in these\\nfirmslookedinparticular for women with no previous experience of\\nworking in theclothing industry.\\nHowever, even amongthe biggest firms the labour-cost savings to\\nbe made by changes inproduction were not major,andother\\nmeasures were also taken.Inparticular, thesecompanies were\\nbetterable to survive because, unlike the small ones, they were\\ngeographicaIly mobile.Insteadofbeingtrappedinhigh-cost areas,\\nthey were able to take advantage ofthechanges going on at the\\nsame time in the geography of the female labourforce. These big\\ncompanies wereunconstrained by the family ties ofownersand\\nmanagers , and they were large enoughand had sufficient capitalto\\ntakeadvantage ofcheaper conditions ofproduction elsewhere in\\nthecountry. Socially, they were a completely different entityfrom\\nthe small companies , and their response was likewise different. And\\nthedifference ingeographical mobility mattered. Thespatial\\npatternofcost and availabilityoflabourwaschanging . While\\ncosts were going up in urbanareas there was a growing female\\nlabourreserveavailable as a result of accelerated declineofmale\\xad\\nemploying industries in theDevelopment Areas,andalsosignificant\\nreserves outsidethemajorcities in smallertowns.IIThese alter\\xad\\nnativesources of female workershadnumerous advantages for the\\nclothing industry.Firstofall, the labourwascheaper. Keeble\\n(1976),summarising theconclusions oftheILAGsurvey,reports\\nthatavailability and cost offemalelabourwere the main factors\\ninducing movement byclothing firms between 1964 and 1967, and\\nininfluencing the choice ofnewlocation. \\'Theestablishment of\\nsmallclothingplantsin many rural and peripheral areas to tap local Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 157\\nsuppliesofunderemployed womenworkers is aprimary reasonfor\\ntherecentdispersal oftheindustry\\' (p. 179).\\nSuchlabourwasnotonlyavailable andcomparatively cheap,it\\nwas also new to the industry.Keeble\\'s (1976)analysis shows\\'avery\\nmarked negative relationship withexisting clothing employment\\',\\nandtheNational UnionofTailors andGarment Workers\\n(NUTGW) reported thatthelaboursoughtby these firms was\\nmainlyfemale,unorganised andnon-trad itionalclothing workers.\\nTherewas far less competition for it from othersectorsthanthere\\nwas inmajorurbanareas.

Smaller, moreperipheral, labourmarkets are ideal (as\\nindeed, in the contextofbigger cities, are homeworkers).\\nLike the small firms in the sector, then, big capitalturnedto more\\nvulnerable sections of theworkforce .

Third,in\\ntheir choice ofnewlocations geographical dispersion andmonopoly\\nover local labourmarketsenabledthese large firms to reinforce the\\nvulnerability of their new employees.\\nSpatialstructures ofbigfirms\\nLet us look moreclosely then at the kind ofspatial structures\\nevolved by these larger multiregional andmultinational companies\\nin theclothing andfootwear industry. How has big capitalin this\\nindustry, anindustry sodifferent fromelectronics, attempted to\\ngainmaximum advantage fromtheexisting formofuneven\\ndevelopment ofthe British space?\\nFirstofall,multiregionality itself means thatthespatialstructure\\nis one in which headquarters functions arecarriedoutin one region\\nwhileproduction in theothersis subject to external ownership and\\nultimatecontrol.Thereis, inotherwords, a hierarchy ofownership,\\nsupervision andcontrol, ahierarchy of therelations ofeconomic\\nownership andpossession. Moreover, increasingly thelocationof\\nheadquarters isinLondon.This results bothfrom the establishment\\nofbranchplantsoutsidethesouth-east by firms already based\\nthere, and from anotherprocess which has been underway at the\\nsame time, thatoftakeover andmerger. This latterprocesshasboth\\nreflected and furtherincreased thestrengthofbig firms in relation\\nto small andhasreinforced thedominance ofLondon as a\\nheadquarters location. Leigh, whose studywasoftakeovers in the\\nsectorin 1973, provides evidence ofhow this processofcentralisa\\xad\\ntion istakingplace largely by moderate-sized andlargercompanies\\ntakingoversmallones(p.12)and, intermsofthebroader\\ncharacteristics ofownership, that\\'themajorpattern. . . isof\\npubliccompanies acquiring privatelimitedcompanies, or, less\\nusually,acquiring thesubsidiaries ofotherpubliccompanies. No\\npubliccompanies were\"acquired\" (Leigh, 1975, p. 5). Moreover,\\nthispatternof typesoffirm ismirrored in ageographical pattern.\\nLeighreportsthatthepictureis one of \\'increasing \"metropolita\\xad\\nnisation\" ofthe United Kingdom clothing industry byLondon\\xad\\nbased firms\\' (p.20). Such companies were at thatperiodactively\\ntakingoversmallerLondon firms as well as provincial companies .\\nTherewas, on the otherhand,littlecounter-provincialisation ofthe\\nindustry \\'sinceprovincially-based firms tend to take over other\\nprovincial firms, not metropolitan ones\\' (Leigh, 1975, p. 20). 160SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThus, aspatialstructure inwhichLondonis the base ofultimate\\ncontroloverinvestment andproduction is increasingly important\\nwithintheindustry. In some cases this base is attached to\\nproduction facilities in the same region, in some cases it is not.\\nTheproduction plantselsewhere are increasingly in rural and /or\\nperipheral regions. This aspect of spatialstructure is increasingly\\ntypicalofthe larger firms in the industry and,therefore , of growing\\nimportance in thesectoras a whole. This is none the lessa sectorin\\nwhich, because ofitshistoricregional bases, quite a fewlarger firms\\nstill have their headquarters outsidethesouth-east (Leigh, 1975).\\nIn its multiregional naturethespatialstructure oflarge firms in\\ntheclothing industry is very like thatof their counterparts in\\nelectronics. In otherways, however, it is clearly different. Ithas\\nalreadybeenmentioned thatthetechnology inclothing meansthat\\ntheadvantages to be derived from size are different from those in\\ntheaatomatable andresearch-based partsofelectronics . In\\nclothing, theadvantages lie in areas otherthandirectproduction\\nand R and D.,This reflects itself in spatialstructure . While this is\\nmultiplant and multi regional location it is not the multiplant\\nstructure characteristic ofelectronics. Itis not a part-process but\\na cloning structure. So, as we have seen, while there is a hierarchy\\nofadministrat ion andcontrol,there is often no hierarchy based on\\na technical division oflabour. Thiscontrast in spatial structure\\naffectsinterregional contrasts. Inclothing thereis little inter\\xad\\nregional difference in the social characteristics ofproduction\\nworkers and because the branchplantsare not embedded in a\\npart-process structure they may be more differentially vulnerable to\\nclosure in economic downturns.\\nThe low levels of technology and division oflabourhaveother\\neffects.This isnot a science-based industry; there isno concentration\\noftechnical and scientific workers in the south-east. The manage\\xad\\nmentstructure oftheadministrative hierarchy isflatter,and there\\xad\\nfore again failsto contribute much to the congregation ofhighly-paid\\nandhigh-status jobsaroundLondon. This also means, ofcourse,\\nthatthe higher proportion ofheadquarters \\'in theregions\\'does not\\nimply a large amountofwhite-collar employment thereeither.\\nThe low level ofdevelopment ofthe technical division oflabour\\nis alsomirrored at theotherendofthespectrum. Justas there has\\nbeen no majorseparate development ofscientific and conceptual\\nfunctions so theproduction jobs are less reduced to repetitive\\nexecution. Clearly theclothing industry, likeelectronics, has Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 161\\ncontributed to the influx ofjobsfor women in ruralareas and\\nperipheral regions. Certainly, too, these jobsare not well paid.\\nIndeed as we have seen the geographical shift itself has been partof\\nthemechanism whereby women\\'s wages in clothing fell behind\\nthose inmanufacturing as a whole. It would be wrong, however, to\\nsee this as entirely unskilled or semi-skilled work. Certainly it has\\nbeen the most mechanisable - and least skilled - sectorswhich have\\ndecentralised. Andlocational changesometimes wenthandinhand\\nwithproduction change. But nevertheless in1971a good 20 per cent\\nof employees even in the most mechanised sectorswere female\\nskilledmanualworkers. This is far above the proportion in any\\nelectronics sector.Thesamefactorswhichmakeeven mass\\xad\\nproduction garment assembly moredifficult toautomate than\\nassembly inotherindustries (theneed to engineer flexible,\\nstretchable two-dimensional fabric into a three-dimensional shape)\\ngives the actualjobcontentofproduction work more ofacraft\\ncharacter . TheNEDOReviewcomments that\\'theindustry has the\\nproblems ofacraftindustry without thecompensating benefit\\nwhichothercraftindustries such as ship-building andhouse\\xad\\nbuilding enjoy,ofproducing ahigh-cost article\\'(NEDO, 1974a,\\np. 47). It would seem, too, thateven these higherpercentages of\\nofficially skilled workers are anunderestimate ofrealjobcontent.\\nFortheclothing industry provides agoodexampleofthecultural\\nandideological natureoftheskillcategories themselves .Phillips\\nandTaylor(1980),analysing astudyoftheclothing industry by\\nBirnbaum (undated), show how the classification ofjobsvaries,not\\naccording tojobcontent, but with the sex oftheworker.Thereisan\\nidentification ofmen with skilled and women with semi-skilled or\\nunskilled status,and this in turnhas been generated through the\\nstruggles of men workers to retain their dominance within the\\nsexualhierarchy outsidework.Throughout thetwentieth century,\\nmachining in theclothing tradehas been donebybothmen and\\nwomen, but where it was done by men it was classified as skilled;\\nwhere it was doneby women it was classified as semi-skilled.\\nSupposed non-comparabilities between men\\'sandwomen\\'s work\\nwere used to justifythisdistinction - the women workedin larger\\nworkshops, in a more subdivided labourprocess, machining men\\'s\\ngarments, while the men worked insmaller shopsmachining\\nwomen\\'s garments . Thisdiscrimination has survived a whole series\\nofredefinitions ofthe basis for skill classification -whatever\\ndefinition wasadopted, differences werealwaysfoundand 162SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nemployed in such a way as to ensure skilled statusfor the men and\\nsemi-skilled for the women (Phillips and Taylor, 1980, p. 85). These\\ndistinctions cannotberationalised in terms of the contentofthe\\nwork.Birnbaum arguesinsteadthattheyaroseoutofthe \\'struggle\\nofmenworkers from the Russian, JewishandPolishcommunities\\ntoretaintheir social statuswithin the family, even when excluded\\nbytheirposition asimmigrants from the \"skilled\" jobstheymight\\notherwise have done. Forcedas they were to takeonmachining\\nworkusuallydonebywomenassemi-skilled, theyfoughtto\\npreserve theirmasculin ity byre-defining (their)machining as\\nskilledlabour.Withintheclothing tradeheconcludes \"theonly\\nway to become skilled was to changeone\\'ssex\" (Phillips and\\nTaylor, 1980, p. 85).\\nIn theclothing industry, then, there is not thatdevelopment of\\ntechnology andthatacutedichotomisation offunctions which so\\ncharacterises majorfirms in electronics . And this conditions a\\ndifferent geographical form. In the clothing industry there are\\nneitherthehigh-status echelons ofRand0northegrindingly\\ndeskilled jobsofsimple assembly. At the assembly end of the two\\nindustries it is the fact thatthejobsaredoneby women ratherthan\\nthe realcontentofthe work which reduces them bothto the same\\nsocialstatus. At the otherend the clothing industry has no real\\nequivalent to thescientists andtechnologists ofelectronics. The\\ncombination ofindustrial characteristics anddifferent waysofusing\\nspace,different spatialstructures, leads to contrasting formsof\\ngeographical variation .\\n** *\\nThereare also indications ofotherspatialstructures within the\\nclothing industry.Firstofall, there are cases where different plants\\ndoperform different roles in a technical divisionoflabour- where\\nthere is, in otherwords, a part-process structure . In the simplest\\ncase, each ofthepart-process plantsperforms different stages in the\\noverallassembly oftheproduct, butnonethe less has very similar\\nemployment structures . In this case, the fact thatthetechnical\\ndivisionoflabourhas thisspatialform does not show up in social\\ndifferences between different regions.Itdoes,however, have effects\\nonintraregional linkages andinterregional relations, forjustas in\\ntheelectronics hierarchy theseplantsreceivetheircomponents (in\\nthis case half-finished garments) from,andsendtheirproduct to,\\notherplantswithin the same company. Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 163\\nInsomeinstances ,however, theseinterplant relations are\\nassociated with social differences in employment structure. This is\\nmainly the case where cutting,performed by men, remains in the\\n\\'central\\' regions and assembly, performed by women, is decentra\\xad\\nlised. Evidence of this spatialstructure exists in bothfootwear (see\\nChapter3;also Massey and Meegan, 1982)and in clothing(NEDO,\\n1974a), but it is difficult to know, withoutmoredetailed enquiry,\\nhow general it is.12Therationale for such a structure is, however,\\nclear.Itwas the cheap femalelabourwhich was the attraction of\\nperipheral regions; indeed, boththeEconomists Advisory Group\\n(undated) andNEDO(1974a) argue thatmaleworkers are not\\navailable in these regions. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, given\\nthe high and rising rate ofmaleunemployment in theDevelopment\\nAreas.Whattheindustries were looking for, however, were men\\nalreadyskilled as cuttersand willing to work for an industry-wage\\nwhich fell between 1950 and 1980 from 110 per cent of the male\\naverage weekly earnings inmanufacturing toaround75 per cent\\n(Department ofEmployment Gazette;Department ofEmployment,\\nNewEarnings Survey). Therewas,moreover, a wayofdealingwith\\ntheproblemofmalelaboursupply which was not available in the\\nfemale-dominated machining process. Forcuttingis more easily\\nautomatable and it seems likely that,for the larger firms which\\ncouldestablish multi-plant structures, ashortage offemalelabour\\nmay have been solved by geographical shift and a shortage of male\\nlabourbyautomation .Itis aninteresting issue which merits further\\nresearch, for it is another casewhereuneven advances in\\ntechnology , long-established andideologically-embedded tradi\\xad\\ntions of who does what job, andchanging locational surfaces (in\\nthis case changing patternsofwage levels)are all involved together\\ninproducing \\'the regional geography ofemployment\\' .\\nThe same process has been going on in the shoe industry, both\\nbetween regions and between towns and adjacent rural areas. And it\\nhas not been confined to very large companies. In theNorwich area,\\ncompetition from the service sector for female labourhaspushed\\ngrowing firms to look outsidethe town for small pocketsoflabour\\n(Moseley and Sant,1977,p. 70). In the east midlands newlocations\\n\\'in rural centres where the local communities haveprovided a small\\nbut useful labourpoolofmarried women\\' have been soughtout\\n(Mounfield, Unwin and Guy, 1982,p. 125). Labourhasnotbeen the\\nonlyfactor, but it has been critical. \\'Market towns and villages,\\nwithoutanysubstantial industrial development ortradition ofshoe- 164SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nmaking,have been chosenin many cases: Corby,dominated bymale\\xad\\nemploying ironandsteel, has provedagoodcentre,too\\'(Mounfield,\\nUnwinandGuy,1982, p. 125).\\nFinally,there is evidence ofanothersetofinterregional relations,\\nthis time at interfirm level between small andlargecompanies. This\\nis the much discussed issue ofsubcontracting. Therearecertainly\\nexamples ,thoughagainhowsignificant it isdifficult to say,of\\nplantsinperipheral regions being tied intosuch astructure . In the\\nNorthEastmanyofthesmallerfirms,particularly in theurban\\nbackstreetsofNewcastle , aredirectlysubordinate tonational retail\\ncompanies (Benwell COP, 1978b). This, again,hasparticular effects\\noninterregional differences . While legally such plantsare locally\\xad\\nowned, the real relations ofcontrollie with a largercompany\\nelsewhere. Such small firms are different from those discussed\\nearlier.Intermsofthe real relations ofproduction andthe\\ndynamic ofaccumulation they are inextricably tied in to the\\nlarge-capital partoftheindustry. In such cases, these apparently\\nindependent plantswill suffer from the vulnerability toexternal\\ndecisions , asopposed simplytodirectmarketforces,usually\\nassociated withclonedbranchplants,andwilldevelop few local\\nlinkages because they are alreadyfirmly tied into a wider structure\\nofproduction .\\nThe impact on national geography\\nAll these spatialstructures inclothing aredifferent bothin their\\nformandin some of theireffects from the spatialorganisation of\\nbig firms in electronics .\\nAt awiderlevel,though, thechanging balance ofspatial\\nstructures in thegarment industry bothreinforces andelaborates\\nthe form ofgeographical differentiation produced by theelectronics\\nandinstruments industries. Mostobviousare thedifferent distribu\\xad\\ntionsofownership andproduction, theformerincreasingly\\nconcentrated in thesouth-east, thelatterincreasingly decentralised\\ntootherregions. As has alreadybeenmentioned , this isprobably\\nlessadvanced inclothing thaninmanyothersectors. Inclothing\\nthereis still a fairly substantial degreeofownership in the\\ntraditional regions. However thefirmswhichdostillhave\\n\\'provincial\\' headquarters are often those with a moretraditional ,\\nlessdynamic structure. Leigh\\'s(1975) evidence on mergers pointsto\\nthis.Threeofthe largest firms in the sectorwereidentified as Some Changing SpatialStructures inthe UK 165\\nhavingtheirheadquarters outsidethesouth-east, butnoneof these\\ntook an active partin theacquisition process he was studying. The\\nregions where there is still a high degree oflocalcontrolinclude\\nYorkshire andHumberside andthenorth-west, together with the\\neastmidlands andEast Anglia. Overall, however, the evolving\\nstructure ofownership in theclothing industry, anditsgeographical\\ndimensions, furthercontribute to theincreasing degreeofexternal\\ncontrolofproduction in thesmallertownsandperipheral regionsof\\nBritain.\\nThese regions, together withsmallertowns in the country as a\\nwhole, have also seen an influx ofclothing jobsforwomen,again\\nmirroring thepatternof bigelectronics firms. The industry is\\nanother majorcontributor to thechanging patterns ofsocial\\norganisation in those partsofthecountry.\\nApartfromexternal controlandapredominantly femalelabour\\nforce, all the spatialstructures ofbig firms withinclothing share\\notherthings with those in electronics .Muchof the early locational\\nstructure of theclothing industry wasrelatedtocomplex patterns of\\nindustrial linkage.Firsttherewerelinkswithothersectors,\\nparticularly with the textile industry. These are now less location\\xad\\nallysignificant. Theotherintersectoral links are with the distribu\\xad\\ntionindustry.Muchoftheoutputoftheclothing industry multiples\\n(i.e.thatpartof thesectorwhich isdominant inthe.decentralisation\\nto theperiphery) isalreadydesignated for specified retail outlets\\nlinked to the firm eitherbyownership or bylong-term contracts .\\nThesecondkindoflinkage - the intrasectoral ones - is typical\\nprimarily ofthesmallercompanies in thefashionendofthesector\\nandagain,therefore, does not applyto thedecentralised production\\nfacilities. Indeed, the \\'very marked negative relationship with\\nexisting clothing employment\\' (Keeble, 1976)mustimply a low\\ndegreeofreliance on local linkage to otherclothing firms. The\\nevidence therefore suggests that, as in the case ofelectronics\\nassembly, these clothing factories willgenerate low local multiplier\\neffects,andhave little economic integration, intheirrecipient\\nregions.\\nLinks between work and community have also changed. As we\\nhave seen, some partsof theindustry, especially footwear, have for\\nlongbeenestablished insmalltownsandruralareas.Here\\nhistorically there has developed aninterpenetration offactoryand\\ncommunity life:\\'Workandnon-work roles and relationships are\\ninterlinked . Theidiosyncrasies oftheindustry are widely under- 166SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nstoodin localcommunities ... workrelationships in thefactories\\nareinfluenced, reciprocally, by thedistinctive valuesofthe ...\\nsmall scale industrial communities in which footwear factories are\\nprincipally located\\' (Goodman, Armstrong, DavisandWagner,\\n1976, p. 59, quotedinMounfield, UnwinandGuy,1982, p. 188).\\nThingsarenotquitethesamearound the new factories in\\nperipheral regions.\\nThechangesinspatialstructure in theclothing industry are also\\nreinforcing theproblems ofthe cities. Jobsare being lost as a result\\nbothofclosures,particularly ofsmall firms and,to some extent,\\ntransfers bylargerfirms. And new jobsandnewinvestment often\\ngo elsewhere. This has not led to significant levels of industry\\xad\\nspecificunemployment in the cities, precisely because there is an\\nalready-established movement ofworkersaway from this sectorand\\ntowards others,butit has been accompanied by aworsening of the\\nworking conditions amongthose left in the industry. So inLondon\\nandthesouth-east, the decline of the better-paid manufacturing\\nsectors,andtheworsening ofconditions inothers,areamongthe\\nfactorscontributing to apolarised socialstructure whichregional\\nper capita andaggregate statistics totallyfail to reflect.\\nInmanyways, then, whatis happening inclothing reinforces the\\npatternofgeographical inequality beingestablished inelectronics ,\\nbut in spite ofthesimilarities there are also majordifferences, which\\nit isequallyimportant to note. Small andlargecapitalinclothing is\\nnot at all the same as small andlargecapitalinelectronics, andthis\\nhasimplications bothsocially and for the structure ofinterregional\\ndifferences .\\nMethodological reflections\\nWhatis going on in clothing andfootwear is notjustachangein a\\ntwo-dimensional geographical patternofemployment but a reflec\\xad\\ntionofthedevelopment ofandchanging balancebetween different\\nwaysofresponding tospatialunevenness; achanging balance\\nbetween different spatialstructures superimposed on each other\\nwithin the employment patternofa single SIC Order.

As well as facing increasing\\nforeigncompetition inproduction, they also suffered from the\\ninternational metropolitan concentration of thegrowing service\\nindustries and their competition forlabour.To hold down labour\\ncosts the largerandmorelocationally-flexible companies soughtout\\nnew reserves, some of which were simultaneously beingaddedto by\\nthefurtherdeclineofthose old basic sectorswhich had once formed\\na key element in a previous international divisionoflabour.\\nTo see thisas aquestion oflocation factorsaloneis to\\nunderestimate bothitsbreadth and itssignificance .Itis also to\\nunderestimate the influence ofgeography itselfas an active element\\nin the process. Differential spatialmobility andabilitytoestablish\\nmultiregional structures ofproduction was animportant partofbig\\ncapital\\'s advantage over small duringthisperiod.Theformer\\'s\\nabilitytoestablish newbranches in new regions can only have\\nfurtherworsened the lot of smallercapital.13Anddifferent spatial\\nstrategies wenthandinhandwithdifferent strategies towards\\nlabour.\\nFurtherissues of explanation and ofmethodology are raised by\\nthecontrasts between large firms in the clothing industry andtheir\\ncounterparts inelectronics. As we have seen, although the socio\\xad\\nlogicalcharacteristics ofwomen\\'s jobsin the two industries are very\\nsimilar, the real jobcontent isratherdifferent. Thishas two\\nimplications. First, it means thatthedecentralisation ofmanufac\\xad\\nturingjobsis not, as often implied, dependent on only one form of\\ntechnological base,butcanoccurwith avarietyofdifferent\\ntechnologies andlabourprocesses. Itis as much dependent on\\nwhodoes ajob(andtherefore thenatureoflabourdemand) as on\\nrealjobcontent. Second,however, what this means in turnisthatin\\neach case a different causalstructure mustbe involved. And indeed\\nthis is so. Large firms in electronics depended for their abilityto\\ndecentralise on achangewithinproduction (including thedevelop\\xad\\nmentofnew,mass-producible commodities) which would free them\\nfromprevious ties to skilled labour.But there has been no such\\nmajorchangeinproduction technology inclothing andfootwear. It\\nhas not been this which has primarily governed itschangein\\nlocation pattern. Inthatsense the clothing industry couldfor\\ncenturies havedecentralised toruralandperipheral regions.\\nAlthough, therefore, it isimportant to know thatit was the 168 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nattraction of cheaper labourwhich induced this geographical shift,\\nit is equally important to know why it happened when it did.\\nIdentification of a location factor in itself cannotanswer this\\nquestion, nor does the explanation lie in a change in labour\\nprocess. As we have seen, the shift has been going on since the\\nSecond World War, thoughvarying over time in its intensity. The\\nquestion is why.\\nIthas been the conjunction of four factors which has been\\nprimarily responsible for this timing. The growth in competition for\\nfemalelabourinurbanareasis along-term factor,though\\nincreasing in intensity after 1960 with the accelerated growth of\\nthe service sector. The emergence of a reserve of female labourin\\ntheindustrial Development Areas is also a long-term phenomenon\\nbut again one which, in the post-war period, accelerated dramati\\xad\\ncally from the early 1960s. The third factor has been the greatly\\nincreased pressure on costs as a result of foreign competition, a\\npressure experienced particularly in the late 1960s and the 1970s.\\nThefourthfactor was the availability of regional policy incentives\\n(andpresumably especially the Regional Employment Premium).\\nTheILAGInquiry(Department ofTradeandIndustry, 1973)\\ncertainly shows regional policy to have been important in the mid\\xad\\n1960s. Such a constellation of factors indicates a very different\\nexplanation ofdecentralisation fromthatwhichobtains for\\nelectronics, and this is true in spite of the fact thatthe\\'location\\nfactors\\' (cheap female labourand regional policy) were the same in\\neach case.To limit industrial location theory to the identification of\\nlocation factors is greatly to reduce its power to explain.\\nMoreover, with reference to the various forms of multiple\\nregression which are so commonly used to string together groups\\nof factors, it must be emphasised thatthe causes which together\\nexplain the decentralisation cannotbe simply added up. They are\\nmutually interdependent andinteracting . Toattemptan assessment\\nof theautonomous influence of one ofthem is therefore to\\nmisunderstand thenatureof the causal structures . Inparticular\\nthe effectiveness of regional policy was both dependent for, and\\nreinforced in, its effectiveness by the existence ofotherconditions.\\nThoseconditions , and the way in which regional policy interacted\\nwith them, were different in different industries. In many parts of\\nelectronics a change in the natureofproduction was necessary for\\nregional policy to be a relevant influence. Forsmall firms in the\\nsameindustry eventhatwas not sufficient if the company was not Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 169\\nlargeenoughto become multilocationaI. In theclothing industry, as\\nwe have seen, the situation wasdifferent again. The question ofthis\\ncomplex role ofregional policy is taken up againinChapter 6.\\nMeanwhile weturnto theexamination ofanothermajorsectorof\\ntheeconomy .\\n4.4Services\\nThe industry: what are \\'services\\' anyway?\\nServiceindustries have been given relatively littleattention in\\nemployment studies. Yet more than halftheeconomically active\\npopulation ofthe UK now works within them. They have also often\\nbeenthought of as subject to different laws from manufacturing\\nindustry, especially in consideration oftheproduction process.\\nIndeed, for long therewas little recognition thattherewasa\\nproduction process in service industries. But events have given the\\nlieto these assumptions .Fromautomation in the office to speed-up\\nin theNational Healthand Social Security services, it has become\\nabundantly clearthatservices are indeed produced andthatthe\\norganisat ionoftheirlabourprocesses issubject to manyofthe same\\npressures andchanges as inmanufacturing industry. And these\\nchanges in theirturnhave begun to have dramatic geographical\\nimplications.\\nServices, however, are clearly not homogeneous. Indeedthey vary\\nalong all the dimensions discussed in Chapter 2. A clear conceptual\\ndistinction can be made between those services immediately geared\\nto thereproduction ofthelabourforce and those for which the\\nmarketisotherbranches ofindustry. The first group,consumer\\nservices, includes most ofthe public services (health,education),\\nmuch of the retail trade,and a vast range ofdirectconsumer\\nservices from hairdressing through cinemas to religious organisa\\xad\\ntions.Producer services, on the otherhand,include business and\\nprofessional functions such asadvertising andmarketresearch, and\\nmuchbanking andinsurance . Clearly, as throughout theindustrial\\nclassification system, few services are entirelyeitherconsumer- or\\nproducer-oriented , but it is possible to make a broadand reason\\xad\\nablyclear-cut division (Marquand, 1979, table 4.9). Thereis also\\nvariation in the natureofownership. Thereare services provided\\nthroughself-employment or by extremely small firms; in contrastan 170SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nincreasing proportion isowned and controlled by medium-scale and\\nlargeprivatecapital; finally, many consumer services in the UK are\\nfinanced and controlled by the State. Justputtingthese divisions\\ntogether withthatbetweenproducer andconsumer services gives a\\nwide range ofcategories. As we shall see, there are still further\\nsubdivisions to be made - variations inlabourprocess also have to\\nbeconsidered. All these dividing lines enable a clearer under\\xad\\nstanding ofthespatialchanges going on, the spatialstrategies\\nadopted indifferent partsof\\'theservicesector\\'.Becauseofour\\ncentralinterest in class and social structure we begin, though, with\\nanexamination ofself-employment and family enterprises, for they\\nare both an important elementofserviceprovision and distinctive\\nin termsoftheir social organisation ofproduction . As we shall see,\\nonce again social change and spatialchange in this partofthe\\nBritish economy are clearly intertwined.\\nSelf-employment andfamilyenterprises\\nIncomparison with many otherWestern European countries, self\\xad\\nemployment and family enterprises are relatively unimportant in the\\nUnitedKingdom, butbothself-employment and very small firms\\n(those with only three or four workers) are more important in the\\nserviceindustries than in any otherpartof the UK economy. Indeed\\nthe service industries broadly definedaccount foroverthree\\xad\\nquarters ofallemployers and self-employed people, most ofthe\\nrest being in agriculture and inconstruction (Marquand, 1979,table\\n1.25).Itisimportant, then, to examine these sectors in orderto\\nunderstand something ofthis aspect ofthe social structure of\\nproduction in theUnitedKingdom.\\nFormostofthe 1960sand 1970s self-employment in the service\\nindustries remained fairly constant atjustover a million people\\n(including here - since the datawill not allow their separation \\xad\\nbothemployers and self-employed). But as a proportion ofself\\xad\\nemployment in theeconomy as a whole thatin services has tended\\nto increase, going from 71.6 per cent in 1961to 78.4 per cent in\\n1975.14Thisaggregate relative healthandstability however,\\nconceals important compositional changes. There has been a shift\\ninsectoral distribution, a shift in the type ofownership and\\norganisation ofproduction and,integral to all this, a shift in\\nspatialdistribution. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 171\\nTable4.1 shows the changeinsectoraldistribution ofemployers\\nandself-employed in services from 1961to 1975. Self-employment\\ninDistributive Tradesfellbothabsolutely andrelatively and\\ncontinued to do so right through the 1970s. Between 1971and\\n1979 the numberofgrocerystoresfell by43000(41 per cent) and\\nmostofthisreduction came from the independent sector,whose\\nmarketsharedeclined from 42.5 to 25.8 (The Financial Times. 21\\nJanuary 1981). In contrast,self-employment in all the otherservice\\nsectorsincreased bothabsolutely andrelatively .\\nYet this is notsimply a shift between sectors.It is not the result\\nof\\'entrepreneurs\\' pullingoutofDistribution andgoingintoother\\npartsofthe social divisionoflabourinresponse todifferences in\\ntherateofprofit.Allself-employed peopleandownersofvery\\nsmall firms, according toWright(seeChapter 2), areeitherpetty\\xad\\nbourgeois (theself-employed) oroccupya classposition somewhere\\nalongthedimension defined between petty-bourgeois andbourgeois\\nclasscharacteristics (theownersofvery small firms). In the context\\noftheUnitedKingdom ,however, thisclassification andcharacter\\xad\\nisationneedsto beelaborated for it misses someimportant\\ndistinctions .Thereare, as we shall see, enormous contrasts within\\nthegroup.Andwhathasactually beengoingon isnotjusta\\nsectoralchangebutachangein theinternalsocialstructure ofthese\\npartsoftheeconomy.\\nSelf-employment in theDistribut iveTradesisprimarily in\\nretailing.

Supermar\\xad\\nkets increased their share of the grocery marketfrom 44.3 per cent\\nin1971to 59.2 per cent in 1979.The advance of the chain-store , the\\nexpansion ofmultiple-outlet retailconcerns, and the growing\\norganisation oftheseindependent enterprises by groupsuppliers\\nand the like, represent not simply the victory of big firms over small\\nbut a change in the dominant form of relations ofproduction and\\ncapitalorganisation; a change in the internal class structure of\\nownership.\\nThe kind ofsmall firms andofself-employment which is\\nexpanding in the service sectoris instarkcontrast. This is\\nparticularly true inInsurance and Banking and Professional and\\nScientific Services (the composition of Miscellaneous Services is\\nmore mixed). Here weare talking aboutaccountants, lawyers, those\\nrunningprivateeducation and medical services, and research and\\ndevelopment agencies.Itisa mixture, in otherwords, of high-status\\nprofessionals\\'< and new entrepreneurial capitalservicing expanding\\nhigh-technology industries. In simple sociological contrast to the\\nshopkeepers of theDistributive Trades,these people, above all, are\\ngraduates .\\n* * *If, then, what looks like simply a sectoral shift is actuallyalso a\\nchange in internal class structure, what does this mean for the\\nchanging patternofgeographical differentiation? First of all the\\nspatialstructure in all these cases of self-employment (and also of\\nthe smallest firms - for which precise regional figures are not\\navailable) is necessarily thatof simple concentration. In all cases\\nthere is, obviously, local control.Geographical differences in self\\xad\\nemployment derive from varying rates of growth and decline and\\nfromcontrasts in social characteristics (status, income, etc.).\\nTable 4.2shows regional variations in self-employment as a propor\\xad\\ntion of total employment in the different branches. The first pointto\\nnote issomewhat parenthetic andconcerns column 1. In East\\nAnglia, the south-west andNorthern Irelandtheproportion of\\nself-employment in all servicesis noticeably (and untypically for the\\ncountryas a whole) lower thantheproportion in the whole regional\\neconomy (column 1 ishigherthancolumn 2).Thisis in all Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 173\\nTABLE4.2Self-employment as apercentage oftotalsectoral\\nemployment. by region. in 19751\\nAll\\nself\\xad\\nemploymentProfessional\\nAll and\\nservices Distribution scientific\\nUnitedKingdom 7.41 8.2 13.57 5.53\\nSouth-east 7.47 7.48 11.47 7.12\\nEast Anglia 9.71 9.02 12.12 5.88\\nSouth-west 10.20 9.36 14.17 5.56\\nEastmidlands 7.14 8.70 16.58 4.67\\nWestmidlands 6.34 8.45 14.23 5.11\\nYorkshire andHumberside 7.05 9.09 15.81 4.25\\nNorth-west 6.86 8.90 15.64 4.82\\nNorth 5.31 6.53 12.20 3.24\\nWales 9.02 9.14 19.51 4.22\\nScotland 5.80 6.48 12.04 4.64\\nNorthern Ireland(1974) 10.48 6.38 14.29 4.26\\nSource: Marquand (1979, table 3.11).\\nprobability dueto the high presence inthoseregionsofself\\xad\\nemployment withinagriculture - theindividual-proprietorship\\nworking-farmer elementofwhatwe have elsewhere termed\\'in\\xad\\ndustrial landownership\\' (Massey and Catalano , 1978). The only\\notherregion which does not follow the national pattern,ofself\\xad\\nemployment beingdominated by the service sector,is thesouth\\xad\\neast,where the proportions areaboutequal.In this case the\\ndifference from the national averageis more likely to be due to a\\nhigher presence of self-employment inmanufacturing, thus con\\xad\\nfirming the analyses bothof small firms in the clothing industry and\\nofthegeography ofentrepreneurship inelectronics .l\"Again,\\nreflecting the historical structure ofmanufacturing andalso the\\ndominance ofprimaryindustries, in this case mining,it isnoticeable\\nthatthenorthandScotland have the lowest overallproportions of\\nself-employment.\\nButwhatinterests us mainly at this pointis theconsiderable\\nvariation between services in different regions. Here it is the\\ncomparison .between Distribution andProfessional and Scientific\\nServices which is important. Lookfirst at the variation in self\\xad\\nemployment inDistribution. Whatthis reflects is primarily the\\ndegree of penetration ofmoreadvanced formsofcapital,a low 174SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\npercentage representing a high level ofpenetration andvice versa.\\nThenorthern region has a long tradition oflargeco-operative s and\\ntheimportance ofsmall,independent tradersiscorrespondingly less\\nthanin regions like the NorthWest and Wales (Bennison and\\nDavies, 1977, p. 9). Overall, the noticeable thing is the lack ofbias\\nofself-employment inDistribution towards thesouth-east of\\nEngland. Indeed, theSouthEast has the lowestproportion of\\nDistribution operated on the basis ofself-employment, anda\\nDevelopment Area (Wales) has the highest. \\'In distribution, self\\xad\\nemployment isremarkably high in Wales, and high in the east\\nmidlands ,indicating the survival oftheindependent andsuggesting\\nrelatively little penetration bynational andlargerlocalshops\\'\\n(Marquand, 1979,para. 3.17).\\nThesituation isprecisely theopposite inProfessional and\\nScientific Services. Here the south-east is faraheadin itspropor\\xad\\ntion ofself-employed, followed by East Anglia. The proportion in\\nthesouth-west isjuston thenational average, and all regions apart\\nfrom these three are below it, with the northhavingaparticularly\\nlow level ofself-employment in these services. Thereis thus a clear\\nlineacrossthecountry, from the Bristol Channel to the Wash,\\nsouthofwhichthereis ahigher-than-national representation,\\nproportionately, ofthesehigh-status ,high-income formsofself\\xad\\nemployment andnorthofwhich the proportion is lower, and\\nconsiderably lower,thanthenational average.\\nIf we now putall thistogether, how do the pattern,andthe\\nchanges in it, relate to the forms of geographical differentiation\\nalreadydescribed ?Thereare twoaspectswhich are important : the\\nsocialstatusof thejobsinvolved, andthe degree oflocalcontrol\\nimplied. The pictureis clear in relationto typeofemployment. Itis\\nthesouthand east of England which has captured the bulk ofthe\\nhigh-status ,graduate-filled type ofself-employment. The shift in the\\nnatureofself-employment in services, therefore, furtherreinforces\\nthedisparities in social composition which are implied by the uses\\nof space in the industries alreadydiscussed.\\nThepatternoflocalcontrol ismorecomplicated . In the\\ndistribution trades, the degree ofself-employment is stillhigherin\\nmanyoftheperipheral regionsthanitis in the southandeast. But\\nit is precisely this form of autonomy which is declining. Again,\\nalthough theamountofself-employment is low in the south-east\\nthis does not mean thatthedistributive tradesinthatregion are\\nexternally-controlled atregional level.Forself-employment in this Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 175\\nbranchis beingreplaced bychain-stores andsupermarkets, etc., the\\nbulkofwhich are multiregional andhavetheirheadquarters in the\\nsouth-east. 17Thisdisparity between regionsisfurtheremphasised\\nby thedominance ofthesouthandeastofEngland in the fast\\xad\\ngrowing partsofself-employment.\\nTherehas,then,been ashiftbothsectoral andsocial in the\\nnatureofself-employment in services, andthis has been integralto\\nitschanging spatialform .Further, theemerging geographical\\npattern, in itsregional variations inoccupational status,ratesof\\ngrowth(intermsofemployment andintermsofaccumulation) and\\nlevelsoflocalcontrol, reinforces manyoftheaspectsofgeogra\\xad\\nphicalinequality whichhavealready beendocumented in the\\nelectronics andclothing industries .\\nOther consumer services: private capital and the State\\nTherestofthe service sectoris bestdealtwith bytaking\\'placein the\\neconomy\\' as the initial criterion ofsub-definition - thedistinction\\nbetween consumer andproducer services. It is this differentiation\\nwhichmostclearlysegments thesector,coinciding bothwith\\ncontrasts in thenatureofownership and,through thevery\\nimmediate relation todifferent markets, withcontrasts in loca\\xad\\ntion. But, as we shall see, thereareimportant subdivisions .\\nTakeconsumer services - thatis,thoseserviceindustries which\\naredirectlyrelatedto the living conditions ofthepopulation. This\\npartoftheeconomic system is controlled andorganised inthree\\ndifferent ways in the UnitedKingdom at themoment. Thesmallest\\npartisthatofself-employment andfamily-ownership , which has\\nalreadybeendealtwith.Second, thereareconsumer services which\\nare runstraightforwardly as a basis for capitalist accumulation \\xad\\nthatis, those in which privateaccumulation isnotincompatible\\nwith the reproduction oftheworkforce to the levels determined by\\nthehistoryofinterclass relations .Third,therearethoseconsumer\\nservices where this politically-arrived-at levelofreproduction is\\nincompatible with the requirements ofprivateaccumulation and\\nwhere services are provided by theState,frequently on anon\\xad\\ncommodity basis. In the UnitedKingdom ,muchofthepublic\\xad\\nsectorprovision ofsuchservices deriveshistorically from the\\nfluctuating consensus ofpost-waryears.\\nFromtheevidence available itwouldseemthatit is only in\\ncertainconsumer servicescontrolled by thepublicsectorthatthe 176SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ngeography ofemployment does not simply reproduce and reinforce\\nthe kindofspatialinequality which results from all the otherspatial\\nstructures examined so far. ISSuchpublicly-provided consumer\\nservices includeeducational andhealthservices and also the\\noperations ofthe local State.\\'\" In terms ofwageearners, there\\xad\\nfore, they are fairly heterogeneous . They include bothhigh-status\\nprofessional employees, such as doctors, groupssuch asteachers,\\nsocialworkersandadministrative workerswhich have over the last\\ntwo decades been undergoing a process of\\'proletarianisation\\' in\\ntermsofworking conditions and social status,andmanualworkers\\nin, forinstance, localgovernment and the health service. All these\\ngroupshave been important components ofthe post-1966 increase\\nintradeunionmembership (NUPE, NALGO, CPSA) and their\\nmilitancy andpolitical stancehaveundergone animportant\\ntransformation over the same period.\\nWhatdistinguishes thegeographical structure of such public\\xad\\nsectorconsumer services from, say, electronics is thatthis wide\\ndiversity ofemployment, in termsofoccupation andstatus,is not\\norganised into such a rigid spatialhierarchy . Indeed, each type of\\nemployment is fairly evenly distributed inrelationtopopulation\\n(Marquand, 1979),certainly incomparison with all the otherparts\\noftheeconomy we have examined so far. Kirwan(1981)shows that\\nthisbroadpictureremained up until 1979, thoughwith a slight\\nweakening in thepositionofsomeoftheDevelopment Areas. In\\npart,of course, this distribution results from the natureofthe\\nserviceitself(it has to be spreadoutfor the services to be\\naccessible). This is not, however, a sufficient explanation . Were\\nthe same services controlled byprivatecapitalit is unlikely that\\nsucharelatively evengeographical distribution wouldhave\\nresulted. This is not to argue thatthere is equal provision of\\npublic-sector consumer services, nor even a truly equal distribution\\nofthe types ofemployment within them. There is not. Thereare\\nmoreNational HealthServicedoctorsper head in the south-east\\nthaninotherpartsof thecountry. But there is an obligation on the\\npublic sector to a minimum levelofprovision regardless ofthe\\nfinancial calculation at eachlocation. This would not be so under\\nprivatecapitalist calculation. Were these sectors organised on the\\nbasisofprivatecapitalist accumulation manypartsofthecountry\\nmight simply go \\'unserved\\'r\\'\\'\\' Therelations ofproduction, there\\xad\\nfore, and the associated natureof the financial calculations made,\\nhave a direct effect on the geographical distribution ofemployment. Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 177\\nThatdistribution cannotbeaccounted forpurelyby the\\'technical\\'\\nnatureofthesector.Indeed, theprivatecapitalwhich is operating\\nwithin the same sectors(thatis,privateeducation andprivate\\nmedicine) ismuch more biased in its distribution towards thesouth\\nand east ofEngland.\\nMuch of this relatively even distribution ofemployment inpublic\\nmedicalandeducational services is, in mostlocations, subjectto\\n\\'external control\\' andthelocation of thiscontrol(theadminis\\xad\\ntrativeheadquarters in thecentralState)isoverwhelmingly in the\\nsouth-east. But the meaning of\\'external control\\' andits effects\\ndependupon the real social relations involved. As it is at the\\nmoment therelations ofexternal controlinpublic-sector services\\nare clearly different from those in the privatesector.Thereis no\\nrelation ofaccumulation andso nogeographical patternof\\nappropriation ofprofits.Moreover, whatever therelation of\\nexternal controlas itoperates now within the publicsector,it is\\nopen to reformulation (forinstance in thedirection ofincreasing\\nlocaldemocratic control) through political action.Thisoptionis\\nnotavailable in theprivatesector.\\'Public\\'ownership andcontrolis\\na necessary, thoughclearly not a sufficient, condition for the\\ntransformation ofsuchrelationships .Morewill be said on this\\nlater,butit isperhaps worthpointing outherethatpublic\\nexpenditure cuts not only produce anincrease inunemployment\\nand a decline in services. Nordo they merely represent anattackon\\noneofthefastest-growing partsoftheorganised labourmovement:\\nthey also imply a reduction injobsin oneofthe fewpartsof the\\neconomy where the spatialstructure ofemployment is not massively\\nreinforcing geographical inequality.\"\\n* * *Thoseconsumer services which are produced on the basis ofprivate\\naccumulation can now be dealtwithquickly.Whatisclearisthat,in\\nspiteofhaving a more even distribution than,say,producer services\\n(see later), there are aspectsofunevenness which do characterise\\nthisdistribution andsomeofwhichfollowthelinesalready\\ndescribed .Marquand (1979) is once againaninvaluable sourceof\\ninformation andanalysis. Her studyshowedthat\\'therewasnothing\\nparticularly evenaboutthedistribution ofmanyconsumer services.\\nPublic services on the whole were evenly distributed, butareas\\nvaried widely in their endowment withprivateservices\\' (para. 6.28).\\nMoreover thisinequality was fairly systematic: thereis amarked\\ntendency forcertainmetropolitan areasto be less well endowed 178SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nthanotherswith the whole range ofprivateservices. Finally,most\\nof themetropolitan areas which are \\'grosslydeficient\\' inconsumer\\nservices arein theAssisted Areas(para.8.18).Even at an\\nintraregional level,privateconsumer services are less evenly dis\\xad\\ntributed thanare public, being in general more biased towards\\nlocation in larger centres (Marquand, 1979, table 4.9).\\nPuttingit alltogether, then, in terms of the kind ofjob,andthe\\nlocationofownership andcontrol,privately-run consumer services\\nincreasingly conform to the general patternofdomination and\\nadvantage in thesouth-east ofEngland. Thelong-term growthin\\nimportance ofmultiple-outlet consumer-service companies, and\\ntheirincreasingly interregional scope, has led also to the dom\\xad\\ninanceofthesouth-east as alocation fortheirheadquarters .\\nRelations ofownership andcontrolareincreasingly concentrated\\nthere. Because ofthenatureoftheir services this is a simple cloning\\nbranch-plant structure .Themaindistinctions injobtype are\\ntherefore related to the hierarchy ofownership andsupervision,\\nand once again, thoughin this case there is no great numberof\\n\\'higher-status\\' jobs,the bulk ofthem are in the southand east.\\nProducer services\\nFinally,producer services.The emergence ofproducer services as an\\nimportant andseparately distinguishable partof theeconomy has\\nmanysources.Banking and finance, the City ofLondon, were the\\nprogenitors of British capitalism itself.Themore recent emergence\\nof a wide range of otherproducer services has been closely related\\nto thedevelopment ofboththe technical division oflabourandthat\\nwithin society as a whole. Thereare anumberofratherdifferent\\naspectstoproducer services. Therearethoserelating to such\\nactivities as administration, controlandmarketing, and there are\\nthoserelating more directly to production itself. The growthof\\nserviceoccupations ofthese varied types results from different,\\nthoughrelated,developments . Thegrowthofadministration and\\nassociated functions derives from the increasing concentration of\\ncapital, from the requirements andpossibilities ofmulti-plant\\nlocation, from the increasing emphasis on anddevelopment ofthe\\nmarketing function, theincreasing complexity oflegalrelations, etc.\\nThoseservices more directly related to production, on theother\\nhand,emerge with the increasing technical division oflabour.The Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 179\\ndegreeto which the different kindsofservices aredeveloped\\ndepends, therefore, ondistinctconditions. Thefortunesofbanking\\nandfinancereflect the changing international organisation of\\ncapitalism. Thegrowthofmanagement-related services is especially\\nresponsive to the concentration ofcapital.Research andassociated\\nservices reflect the development oftechnology inparticular direc\\xad\\ntions and the political centrality oftechnology-development itself.\\nThere is also another distinction which can be made within\\nproducer services.Insome cases they are internalised -provided by\\nthe firm which uses them - in othersthey are provided byseparate\\ncompanies .Thisdistinction reflects thedevelopment ofthe\\ntechnical division oflabourgiving rise to a furtherdevelopment\\nofthe social division oflabourwith the creationofnewbranches.\\nWhatwere once functions within the overall plannedrelationsofan\\nindividual firm are now separate commercial entitiesbounded by\\nmarketrelations.

The last\\xad\\nmentioned authorssuggest four main reasonsfor thisconcentration\\nofcorporate research laboratories in thesouth-east.

The first reason relates precisely\\nto theconcentration ofindustries such as electronics, which wehave\\nalreadydiscussed.

The lattersituation isparticularly character isticofthe\\nengineering industries, and it obviously leads to a very different\\nkindofgeographical distribution : \\'Such units tend to be small and\\nscattered throughout theLondonarea, the Midlands and most of\\nthedevelopment regions\\' (Crum and Gudgin, 1978,para. 326).\\nSince most internal research and development isofthis type, it\\nmight indicate a counterbalance to thecentralisation in thesouth\\xad\\neastofthese \\'high-status\\' jobs.\\nBut things are not so simple. The very fact ofgeographical\\nlocation- atproduction sites orseparated from them - is an index,\\nbothofthenatureoftheRandD being undertaken , and of the\\nkindsofemployment involved. The Rand0 atproduction sites is\\nprimarily development work (the \\'0\\'ofR and D), more intimately\\nconnected withproduction itself, less \\'theoretical\\' and less long\\xad\\nterm.Italso involves ratherdifferent kindsofstaff. Scientific and\\ntechnical workers can be subcategorised intoresearch staff,\\nproduction engineers and draughtspeople . It is the first (research\\nstaff) which are most likely to be located away from production at\\ndetached Rand0 sites. The second two are more often located\\nalongside production. Wealreadysawindications ofthisdistinction\\nin the study ofelectronics. The overall result is thatthemajorover\\xad\\nrepresentation ofsuchworkers in theoutermetropolitan area\\naroundLondon, and inotherareas in the south-east andsouth\\xad\\nwest, is in the research occupations - scientists, general engineers\\nandtechnicians .Production engineers and draughtspeople are also\\nmore-than-proportionally presentin these areas, but for them the\\ndeviation is onlyhalfas large. Moreover, severalotherareas,\\noutside thesouth,have high proportions ofdraughtspeople, Some Changing Spatial Structures in the UK 181\\nparticularly the old shipbuilding andheavyengineering areas\\n(CrumandGudgin, para.85).\\nInotherwords,although areasoutsidethesouthand east are\\nbetterrepresented in these professions as a whole, more detailed\\nanalysis reveals important distinctions. And the social character of\\nthesedistinctions isclearly reflected in geographical differences .The\\nhigher-status jobsarebothmoredistantfromdirectproduction in\\ntermsofthe technical division oflabourandmoredistantfrom it\\ngeographically. They are also morelikely to be in the southern parts\\nofEngland. Thereisagain,inotherwords, a clearandmutually\\xad\\nreinforcing relationship between aspatial andspatialdivisions of\\nlabour. In this case the greater thedegreeofseparation of\\nconception fromexecution, thegreater is likely to be their\\ngeographical separation too.\\nMoreover, this is only research and development withinmanu\\xad\\nfacturing firms and therefore embedded in thedivisionoflabour\\nwithin those firms. The evidence available, however, indicates that\\nresearch and development which is separated offinto adistinct\\nbranchofproduction is evenmoregeographically concentrated,\\nand again into the south-east. ThedatainTable4.3 aretakenfrom\\nthestudyby Buswell and Lewis (1970) andshow clearly boththe\\ngeneralconcentration in thesouth-east andthehigherdegree of\\nthatconcentration in those partsofresearch which are organised\\ninto anindependent branch. These figures are for 1968, butthe\\ncumulative natureof thelocationofresearch meansthatsuch an\\nadvantage, onceattained, will not easily be lost. The difference\\nbetweenindustrial andotherprivatefirms is wide andindicates that\\nthedevelopment of thegeographical distribution ofemployment in\\ntheseactivities maydependinparton thefuturerelationship\\nbetween the developments indifferent aspectsofthe division of\\nlabour.Butwhatever this precise balance, therapidgrowthand\\ngeographical concentration which has so far occurred inresearch\\nforindustry isundoubtedly contributing to thefurtherdominance\\noftheouter-metropolitan south-east ofEngland in thedistribution\\nofhigh-income, high-status jobs.\\nOne reason frequently mentioned for the higher concentration of\\nautonomous research services in the south-east is theirattraction to\\ntheheadquarters ofmajorfirms, for it is through these head\\xad\\nquarters thatresearch contracts are assigned. Thereis thus a link\\nbetween the two typesofproducer services intheirspatial 182SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nTABLE4.3The percentage of UKresearch establishments in the\\nsouth-east ofEngland, 1968\\nIndustrial firms\\nOther private firms\\nResearch Associations\\nGovernment and nationalised industries\\nTotal\\nSource: Buswell and Lewis (1970).45.2\\n77.4\\n43.4\\n54.9\\n50.2\\nconcentration . The fact thatdetached company headquarters are\\nalso biased in their location towards thesouth-east, andthatthe\\ndegreeofdetachment and bias increases the larger the company, is\\ntherefore doublyimportant. First, itreproduces the difference in job\\ntypeandin the presence /absence ofcontrolfunctions between the\\nsouth-east and the rest ofthecountry. On this, the evidence on the\\nrelation between managerial location andmanagerial function is\\nimportant. While all managerial andprofessional occupations show\\nsomeconcentration inLondonand thesouth-east, \\'there is a clear\\ngeographical split between controland executive functions. Itis the\\nformerwhich is more often centralised and the lattermore often\\nlocatedatproduction sites. Second, the concentration ofupper\\xad\\necheloncontrolfunctions in thesouth-east furtherencourages the\\nlocation thereofautonomou sproducer services. Thespatial\\nconcentration ofheadquarters ofmajorcorporations isclear\\n(Parsons , 1972;Firn, 1975;Goddard andSmith, 1978) and is\\nincreasing with the increasing centralisation ofcapital(specifically\\ncentralisation hereratherthanconcentration ; it is mergers which\\nappearto be the majormechanism). As Marquand (1979)points\\nout: \\'Theconsequences for the service sectorare serious since\\nbranch plants drawsignificantly feweroftheir services from within\\ntheregionthanlocally-owned plants,withsubsidiaries in an\\nintermediate position.(Thesame is nottrueofpurchases of\\nmaterial input.)\\'(para. 3.61). Crum and Gudgin(1978)summarise\\nwhat they see as the main reason for this spatialconcentration .\\nThey write\\nDetached head offices are locatedin thesouth-east because of:\\n(i) the positive advantages ofagglomeration thataccrue to\\nchairmen [sic]andmanaging directors because ofthe\\npotential for extensive contacts, at aseniorlevel, with SomeChanging SpatialStructures in the UK 183\\npersonnel inothercompanies ,government , finance, and\\nfromabroad\\n(ii) the need of finance directors to benearthe City\\n(iii)internal linkages within firms thatmake it desirable that\\nhead offices shouldinclude a minimum numberofnon\\xad\\nproduction functions thatrequire extensive contacts with the\\nchairman [sic],managing director, and finance director.\\nManyofthesefunctions also derive benefits from the\\npossibility andeaseofcontacts withexpertsin theLondon\\narea\\n(iv) the spanofresponsibility ofsenior personnel dictating that\\nimmediate subordinates shouldbe close at hand, except in\\nsituations suchthatthere is a breakbetween controland\\nexecutive action\\n(v) the superior facilities provided forbothUK and interna\\xad\\ntionalcommunications (CrumandGudgin, 1978,\\npara.392).22\\nThis list of factors also gives some indication ofwhyindependent\\nfirmsproducingadministrative, marketing, legal services, etc., are\\nalsoconcentrated in thesouth-east. Forthisgroup, one can add to\\nthereasonsfor thelocation ofinternal headquarters services the\\nneed tobenearthoseheadquarters themselves .r\\'Once again, the\\nmutually-reproducing natureofthevariouscomponents ofthis\\noverallconcentration is very clear. Once underway,private-market\\nmechanisms areunlikely tostopit.TheSICOrderInsurance\\nBanking andFinanceisnotablyboththeOrdermostclearly falling\\ninto the category ofexternal administrative producer services and\\ntheOrderwhich is most highly concentrated into thesouth-east of\\nEngland (Marquand, 1979, tables 3.1 and3.2).

Increasingly within the larger firms this\\ntechnical division is takingon ageographical form, with the high\\xad\\nstatusjobsremaining inLondonand/orthesouth-east and the more\\nroutinework,providing onlylow-status andlow-income jobs,being\\ndecentralised .Norisit only privatefirms. Anumberofdepartments\\nofcentralgovernment haveadopted asimilarpattern.This is, once\\nagain, aspatialstructure which divides the sexes. It is also a spatial\\nstructure whichincorporates bothahierarchy ofrelations of\\neconomic ownership and possession and a technical hierarchy of\\nproduction. Itistherefore different from the cloningstructure\\nadopted by large clothing firms. But it is also different fromthat\\nin big firms in electronics. Forthis is adifferent technical division of\\nlabour.Herevirtually all theemployees arewhite-collar , non\\xad\\nmanualworkersand the division is a fairly straightforward twofold\\none. The mixtureofmanagers, professionals and scientific workers\\nat the\\'top-end\\' ofthehierarchy is, however, very similar in class\\nlocation tothosein theupperechelons ofthehierarchy in\\nelectronics , and insharpcontrast to theranksofclerical workers.\\nAs would be expected, big companies have a higher tendency to\\ndecentralise . This is in partbecause size makes multiple location\\neasier, and smallerfirms may find the pull ofthesouth-east for the\\ncontrolandprofessional functions andstaffgreaterthan the savings\\nto bemadeelsewhere on the routinejobs.Forinalmostall casesof\\ndecentralisation, whatever the sizeoffirm, a head office is retained\\ninLondon. Inotherwordswhatisoccurring isnotjusta\\ngeographical shiftin an industry butthedevelopment of anew use\\nofspace.Again, while manymoves are only short-distance ones,\\nremaining within the south-east , it is the bigger companies which\\ntend todecentralise theirroutinefunctions over longer distances. In\\ncontrast, the few \\'whole moves\\' which do occur(inotherwords\\nwhere no centraloffice is left in London, and thus no split spatial\\nstructure isestablished) tend to be precisely the shortest-distance\\nones,remaining in the regions aroundLondon (Marquand, 1979,\\npara.5.36).\\nThereasonsfor thisspatialstructure themselves indicatesome of\\nthe effects it is likely to have. Thereare three main groupsof\\nlocation factors involved, andto someextenttheymirrorthose for\\nthetertiary sectorwithinmanufacturing. Firsttherearethe\\nadditional costsofaLondon location,encouraging thedecentrali- Some Changing SpatialStructures in the UK 185\\nsationofthosefunctions which\\'can\\'bedecentral ised.Theevidence\\nisthatbothrent and wage costs decline with distance fromLondon\\n- for up to about60miles from the city centre. This, then, is a push\\nfactor. But it operates differentially . The second factorhasalready\\nbeenmentioned -thatof the necessity for \\'contact networks\\'. Itis\\noneofthe most accepted axiomsoflocational analysis thathigh\\xad\\nstatuspeople, faced with the long-term orientation decisions (which\\ntheirfunctions at the apex oftherelations ofeconomic ownership\\nand possession imply) require frequent face-to-face contactwith\\nsimilarly high-status people. This, then, is a real \\'linkage\\' reasonfor\\nclustering, asopposed to the social mechanisms discussed in the\\ncontextof research scientists in electronics. But such economic\\nreasonspresumably apply more to the managerial thanto the\\nproduction hierarchy. Thelatter(the high-flying technicians and\\nresearch workers) areperhapsmore able to operatetheirresidential\\npreferences. In their case it wi11be the more social-class andinternal\\nlabour-market aspectsoflocation whichfuel the cumulative\\ncausation . This may also relateto thedifferent intraregional\\ndistributions ofmanagers andscientific staff.Itis themanagers\\nwho tend to be most highly concentrated inconurbations .Within\\nthesouth-east it is the scientific and technical workerswho have the\\ngreatertendency to be in the more ruralstretches of the\\'sunbelt\\'\\nand theoutermetropolitan arearatherthaninLondon itself.\\nThirdly, intheestablishment ofthesespatialstructures thereare\\nthenon-cost aspectsoftheroutineclericalworkers. The LOB case\\nstudy found that\\'almostall firms appeared satisfied with their\\nmoves.Staffmoralewasalmostalwayshigherandabsenteeism\\nlower;productivity had often improved. Few difficulties were found\\ninrecruiting clericallabourlocally\\'(Marquand, 1979,para.5.38).\\nPuttingall these factors together, ofcourse,means precisely that\\nit is the low-status jobswhich are decentralised, precisely those\\npartsoftheoperation whichrequire,andgenerate, few local\\nlinkages and which include few functions ofcontrol.Whatremain\\ninLondonand thesouth-east\" are the high -statusjobswhere wage\\ncost is not the main criterion, the overall controloftherelations of\\nownership , and the contact-generating functions whichbothenable\\nanadvantage, once-gained, to become self-reinforcing andwhich\\ngive to a regional economy precisely thatinternalcoherence which\\nis beingdestroyed inotherregionsofthecountry.Marquand sums\\nup thepotential effects in the areas recipient ofdecentralised office\\nwork:\\'Itisimportant to bear in mind the disadvantages to the 186SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nreceiving community ofrelocating largeblocksofroutineoffice\\nworkthere.

They were\\ndominated by, and oftendeveloped by, thecoal-mining industry.\\nThe decline of Britain\\'s imperial position, and the collapseofthe\\ncoal-exporting industry therefore entailed thebeginning oftheir\\nlong-term economic decline.

Itwas the kindofsituation which\\nFriedman (1977, p. 53) refers to as producing \\'resonance\\' between\\nworkers - abasisforsolidarity .Second,therewererelatively few\\nwithintheindustry in these areaswhocouldnotbedefined as\\nworking class.Thedivisionoflabourwasnotdeveloped sufficiently\\nto form the basis ofanysignificant clementofthosestratawhose\\nfunctions includemiddle-range management , themaintenance of\\ncapitalist discipline andmentalasopposed tomanualwork.\\nMoreover , thisdominance ofa single industry was reinforced in\\nitseffectsby thenatureoftradeunionorganisation withinthat\\nindustry.

Thepotential effectsofsuchcondition sare\\nindicated byLockwood (1958)andSayles (1958), who find that\\nworkerresistance isgreaterincoherent communities dominated by\\nonefactoryor oneindustry. In this case it was both.Indeed, the\\ngrowthofunionisation inminingwasmainlythrough strong\\ndistrictassociations whichwerefrequently jealousoftheirauton\\xad\\nomy(Beacham , 1958, p. 146; FrancisandSmith, 1980).Notonly,\\ntherefore , were these communities highlyproletarianised, butalso\\ntheirpotential fororganisational andpolitical unitywas high.\\nOfcourse,while these conditions maymakeorganising easier,\\ntheydon\\'tguarantee aparticular response.

Coherence ofindustrial structure initselfguarantees\\nnothing.Nevertheless, thesegeographical areasandtheunions\\nassociated withthemhave,bothsymbolically andactually ,\\nthroughout thiscentury beencentresofstrength for the trade\\nunionmovement in theUnitedKingdom . The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 191\\nIthas, however, been an organisational strengthofaparticular\\nkind.Itiseconomically militant. In 1974, ofcourse,it led to the\\nresignation ofthegovernment ; but the record over the longer\\nperiod is equallynotable. Beacham (1958) reckons thatfrom the\\nthirtiesto the fifties miners, a mere 4 per cent oftheeconomically\\nactive,accounted foroveronethirdofthe losses causedby\\nindustrial disputes inGreatBritain.\\' But this is also a unionism\\nwhich is defensive ofstatuswithin the working class, astatusbased\\nnot somuchoncraftskillsandhigherwages, as, say, with\\nengineers, but on closed-shop solidarity and a clear identityof\\njob. TheNational UnionofMineworkers was aleadingunion in\\nthe fight for the closed shop,and was one of the first to win\\nrecognition oftheprinciple fromemployers (Beacham, 1958,\\np. 146).Itis astatuswhich has a basis, too,in pride in the\\nphysical toughness of the work. This is a pride which refers itselfto\\nmasculinity, acharacteristic based not only on the natureofthe\\nwork but also on the complementary lackofpaidemployment for\\nwomen. This, as Beynon (1973) says is \\'thesolid,traditional heart\\nof the British labourmovement\\' (pp.7{}-1)- with all its positive\\ncollectivism, its militantstrength, and its social conservatism.\\nThesecharacteristics werenotsimply a productofwhatmight be\\ncalled\\'purelyeconomic\\', still less \\'locational\\' ,mechanisms . Even\\nthesingle-industry natureoftheseareas,andconsequently their\\nrelative coherence , was also the result ofsocialandpolitical\\nprocesses. First, the lack of paid work for women. All these areas\\nhad,andinvaryingdegrees still have, very low female activityrates\\n(with the exception ofthe large towns andtheconurbations, which\\nare, in any case, offthecoalfields) . In the colliery towns the rate\\nwassometimes extremely low. The increase in paid employment for\\nwomen began in the Second WorldWar,buteven in the mid-1960s\\nin some towns it was as low as 20 to 25 per cent (Department of\\nEmployment andProductivity, 1970).Thisseemsmorethan\\nanything to have been a result ofthenatureofthe work doneby\\nthe men (in particular the fact thatitdemanded largeinputsof\\ndomestic labour, and the fact thatit wasoftenshift-work) andof\\ntheprimacy accorded tothatwork. As H umphrys (1972)points\\nout,women\\'s \\'placewas clearly seen as being in the home looking\\nafterthebreadwinner\\' (p. 30). Secondly, there seems in a numberof\\ncases to have been an active policy ofkeeping outalternative\\nemployment for men. The dominance ofthese local labourmarkets\\nby single industries was not simply a result oflocation factors.The 192SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nNational CoalBoard,forinstance, seems to have guarded rather\\njealously themonopoly ofthe male labourforce which it held in the\\nnorth-east (Hudson, 1982).Thirdly, very little competition for this\\nlabourwasgenerated locally by the rise ofindigenous firms. This,\\nagain,is acharacteristic which these oldercoalfields ,ofsouth\\nWales,ofthenorth-cast ofEngland and ofScotland, have in\\ncommon.Itis also, as we shall see, in partaproductof the class\\nstructure associated with the dominant industries .\\nIn all these ways, then, in the lack ofjobopportunities for\\nwomen, in the lack ofalternative jobsfor men, in the lack ofa\\nlocally-owned \\'small-firm-sector\\', the coal industry (and in the\\nbroader regionsotherindustries such as steel) determined the\\nconditions of existence ofother(actualorpotential) partsofthe\\nlocaleconomy. And those conditions weredetermined bymechan\\xad\\nismsbotheconomic andextra-economic .Therewereothereffects,\\ntoo; on the potential (or lack of it) for local financing (Humphrys,\\n1972), on the establishment only ofsectorsvery directly relatedto\\nthe main industries, and even on the spatialstructure , which itself\\nwas aconstraint onincoming capital(theexport-orientated north\\xad\\nsouthcommunications systemofthe Welsh valleys is a very good\\nexample) .Itis in this sense, ratherthanjustnumerically ,thatthe\\ncoalindustry hasdominated theemployment structure ofthese\\nareas.\\n* * *Compared with the overwhelming preponderance oftheworking\\nclass,otherclasses have been much less important. Therehas been,\\nhowever, quiteasignificant and fairly long-tasting traditional petty\\nbourgeoisie . Such a class seems to have existed in all the older\\ncoalfields but it was particularly strongin the Welsh valleys. The\\nexistence ofa largenumberofsmallish, relatively isolatedcommu\\xad\\nnities,together with the influence ofthephysical structure on\\ncommunications, encouraged a relatively high level oflocal, and\\nlocally-owned, services (H umphrys, 1972, p. 28). Sometimes the\\nunionitself would be involved in runninglocalcommunity services,\\nparticularly in welfare, education andrecreation (Department of\\nEmployment andProductivity, 1970;FrancisandSmith,1980), but\\nthere was also a significant degreeofprivatelocalownership. The\\nextent to which this traditional pettybourgeoisie has hung on varies\\nconsiderably between areas, but the structure ofsmallcommunities\\nhasagainincreased its longevity. Segal (1979, p. 214) pointstoboth\\nthesmallness ofthelocalpopulation basesandthelimited TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 193\\npurchasing powerandrange of demand asdiscouraging not only\\nthedevelopment of localconsumer-goods production butalso the\\nentryoffully-capitalist retailing chain-stores andthe like.\\nIncontrast to this presence ofthetraditional pettybourgeoisie,\\nthere has been a very low level ofdevelopment bothofa newpetty\\nbourgeoisie andofsmallentrepreneurial capital.As we have seen,\\nthe lack of the formerisinpartdue to the absenceofanysignificant\\nmanagerial hierarchy orindependent technical functions within the\\ndominant industries. The lack ofanyimportant development of\\nsmallcapitalseems to be related to a whole complex ofcauses.\\nCertainly, cultural factors haveplayedsomepart,but,as\\nHumphrys pointsout, it \\'seems reasonable tospeculate\\' thatthe\\nsupplyofinvestment fundsandentrepreneurial talentwithin the\\nregion has also been largely affected by the natureandorganisation\\nof thedominant industries (p. 31). The dominant industries in this\\ncase include not only coal-mining but also metal manufacture . The\\nsamearguments apply to heavy engineering, moreimportant in the\\nnorth-east ofEngland. The influence oftheseindustries (oractually\\nof their social organisation) has varied bothbetween regions and\\nover time. In southWales, the semi-colonial natureofmuchofthe\\nearlydevelopment ofcapitalism had its effect. In the early days, the\\nsiphoning-off ofthe available investment fundsandthedomination\\nof much of the development by English capital(Lovering , 1979)\\nwereofparticular importance. And the characteristics ofthe\\nindustries themselves have not been conducive to the formation\\nof suchstrata. Both the occupational structure andthe large size of\\nindividual works,together with the fact thatsingleworksoften\\ndominated wholelabourmarkets (Gudgin, Brunskill andFother\\xad\\ngill, 1979) have in this sense been negative influences. These latter\\ninfluences have also been important in theothercoalfields . Segal\\n(1979)provides adetailedanalysisofthecharacteristics ofthepast\\nindustrial structure which have contributed to thisaspectofclass\\nformation insouthWales, west centralScotland andthenorth-east\\nofEngland. Hesummarises themunderthreeheads: thenatureof\\nthetraditional products andtheassociated labourprocesses, the\\nnatureof theindividual companies engaged in theproduction of\\nthesecommodities, andthegeographical settlement patternwhich\\nwasassociated with the industries (pp.214-15).\\nFinally, innoneof these coalfield areas,norin their wider\\nregions, is there now a local capitalist classofmuchsignificance\\nin terms ofcommitment toindustrial production within the areas. 194 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAgain, the picturevaries a bit from region to region. In south\\nWales, this characteristic is more accentuated thanin theother\\ncoalfield areas,certainly inpartas a result, once again, ofEnglish\\ndomination. This was particularly true of the metal industries ; the\\ncoalindustry itself had a greaterpresenceofWelshcapital, and its\\nstructure seems to have had much in common withthatelsewhere\\n(Carney, LewisandHudson, 1977).Thedeclineofthecoal\\nindustry, however, changed the \\'regional\\' natureofthatcapital.\\nIn coalproduction privatecapitalwas replaced by Stateownership,\\nenabling the former to continue toaccumulate byfurtherdiversify\\xad\\ning itsinvestment, bothoutsidethesectorandoutsidethe region. In\\nsouthWales indeed what was once big capitalseems to have\\nabdicated anyconnection with the region even more than has\\nbeen the case in the othercoalfield areas. In the north-east of\\nEngland, withoutacolonial aspect to its development and with a\\ngreaterpresence of engineering in the wider region, there was a\\ngreaterinitial presence ofa genuine local ruling class. But here, too,\\nthere has been a long process ofdiversification, outofthe initial\\nsectorson their decline (and not only with nationalisation), and out\\nofthe region (see Benwell Community Project, 1978a). Itnow\\nretainsneitherthecoherence ofitsformerhegemonic role within the\\nregion (and the real strength ofthatformerrole is well documented\\nby Benwell COP)nor the high level ofcommitment ofits own\\ninvestment resources to thatregion. The pointisthatthese regions\\ntend to have a capitalist class which is reg ionallymuch less\\ndistinctive thanis theirworking class.Fortheworking class this\\ndifferentiation isbotha source ofstrength (in terms ofregional\\ncoherence) andapotential sourceofweakness (intermsof\\ninsularity , for example). Capital- at least, large and medium\\ncapital- has achieved a far greaterdegreeofsupraregionality. it\\nwould be wrong to supposethatthere isnothing\\'local\\'at allabout\\ncapitalin these areas, as the Benwell Community Projectpamphlet\\nThe Making ofa Ruling Class pointsout for the north-east of\\nEngland,butin purely economic terms it is now increasingly\\nmerged into international capital.\\n* * *All these characteristics have in turnformed one basis for the\\ndevelopment ofothers:electoral domination by theLabourParty,\\nalabourmovement whosedemands focus on Stateintervention ,\\nand a politics ofregional consensus.

A The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 195\\nnumberofthe\\'variables\\' which, in the past, have been said to\\nproduce aLabourvote come together here: the traditional indus\\xad\\ntrialoccupation, theself-contained communities , theintergenera\\xad\\ntional similarity ofwork, the high level ofunionisation (Blondel,\\n1977, p. 64). The NUMhas amajorrole in the LabourParty. In\\n1970it was only the eighth biggest unionin thecountry, but it still\\nhad as many candidates and MPs as the engineers\\' union, the\\nAUEW, which was four times larger. The fact ofgeographical\\nconcentration hascertainly beenpartoftheexplanation for this\\ncontinuing influence (Blondel, 1977, p. 210).\\nThedominance oftheLabourPartyin these mining areas has\\nbeenassociated with aparticular kindofold-style Labour(and\\nlabour-movement) politics - a politics very much based around\\ndemands forStateintervention andStatecontrol.Coal,and indeed\\nmostofthemajorindustries ofthe wider regions, have, on their\\ndecline, been brought underStateownership.

In\\nthis way Tyneside\\'s old ruling class has been able to implantwithin\\nofficialthinking its owndefinition oftheproblems affecting the\\nregion, and advocate solutions thatbest suit its own material\\ninterests\\' (Benwell COP,1978a, p. 63).\\nThus,the leaders of local industry, even if retiredfrom their\\nownership oftheregion\\'s majorsectors, retained animportant 196 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\npolitical influence .Moreover, this local hegemon ic role was\\nfrequently endorsed by at least the leadership ofthetradeunions\\nin the region. Whatwas effectively constructed was a politics of\\nconsensus about\\'theneedsofthenorth-east\\' . And such a consensus\\nwas necessary if a policy in many ways determined bylocally-based\\ncapitalwas to be implemented by local authorities which were\\nfirmly in the handsoftheLabour Party(Carney, Lewis and\\nHudson, 1977, p. 65). In Wales, a not-dissimilar consensus has\\nbeenconstructed (Rees and Lambert, 1979). Here, however, the\\nnotionof\\'the region\\' as a simple and non-contradictory entityis\\nbased more on nationalism thanon the presence ofa locally\\xad\\nhegemonic ruling class. In considering the 1967 WhitePaper,\\nWales: the Way Ahead, thenearestthingthatWales has to a\\nnational plan, Rees and Lambert suggestthatit isa clear expression\\nofthe\\'regionalist consensus\\' which had developed by the early\\n1960saboutthenatureofthe Welsh regional problem, the goals of\\nWelsheconomic development , and the means for their achievement:\\n\\'Itis a\"consensus\" inthatit cuts across the divisions of Welsh\\nsociety,embodying bothorganised labourandcapital,and the\\npolitical parties\\' (p. 10).The numerical dominance ofone class has\\nbeen an important basis for this. Cooke(1981b) talks of\\'the\\nmystical image of a classless society which has traditionally served a\\nvariety of political interests so well\\' (p. I). And the contentofthe\\npolicies focused on good old-fashioned Stateintervention :\\'The\\n\"consensus\" clearlyheldthatStateintervention in the form\\noutlined inWales: the Way AheadcouldsolveSouthWales\\'\\nremaining problems\\' (Rees and Lambert, 1979, p. 14).\\nThe impact, or \\'the combination oflayers\\'\\nItwas into this contextthatcame the female-employing , low wage\\nbranchplantsdiscussed in Chapter 4.Itwas not a new phenomen\\xad\\non.Women\\'s employment in these areas has been increasing since\\nthe Second WorldWar(which seemed to provide the necessary\\neconomic stimulus and ideological rationale to begin the process of\\nraising the traditionally low female activity rates), and coal-mining\\nhas been declining, in employment terms, for much of this century.\\nBut the process has accelerated , and with it the starkness ofits\\nimpact, to reach a peak between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s.4\\nNeitherare these the only new sources ofjobsin these regions;\\nChapter4,afterall,lookedonly at a few sectors.

The increasing\\nparticipation ofwomen in the wage labourforce was not the only\\nthing going on. Socially, however, it was ofcrucialimportance .\\nSowhathave been the effects on the social structure ofthese\\nareasofthecombination ofthecontinuing declineofthe old use of\\nspace with the increasing importance oftheirinsertion into a new\\nspatialdivisionoflabour?\\n* * *First,this shift in economic role and structure has not had negative\\neffects on, norbeenopposed by, the remains ofregionally-owned\\nmediumand large capital.Indeed,as we have seen, such capitalhas\\nbeenimportant informingthe plans and policies which enabledthe\\nentryofthe new forms ofproduction , and it has participated in, and\\nto some extent benefited from, the process by its involvement in the\\nfinancial andproperty sectors. Benwell Community Project(I978a)\\ndocuments the roleofthe old local bourgeoisie inbuilding societies,\\nand land and property dealinganddevelopment in thenorth-east.\\nSo theprevious strategyofdiversification hasenabledcapitalnot\\nonly not to be harmedtoo much by the decline oftheindustries in\\nwhich it was originally involved but also (to the extentthatit has\\nnotabdicated altogether - as insouthWales) to benefit from the\\nnext role to be played by \\'its region\\'in thenational andinterna\\xad\\ntionaldivision of labour.Moreover, to theextentthatthiscapitalis\\nstill involved in industrial production within the wider regions it is\\nmore aquestion of its participating in the process of multinationa\\xad\\nlisationthanof being harmedby theentryof new, much larger,\\ncapitals. The kind oflabourwhich it requires, still being largely\\nmale, isnotsuddenly boostedin itsbargaining powerbyincreasing\\ndemand. Theincoming multinationals seek a higher proportion of\\nfemalelabour,while the bargaining powerofthe men is kept slack\\nby thecontinuing redundancies from the basic industries .More\\xad\\nover, to the extent thatthiscapitalhad formed itself into a local\\n\\'establishment\\', it has not been unseated from this position either.\\nInall these regions the professional andinstitutional infrastructure\\nand theprominent positions in political and civic affairs, although\\nby nomeanssodominated as in the pastby the\\'leadersoflocal\\nindustry\\' (Benwell COP,1978a) have certainly not been takenover\\nby the new managerial personnel oftheincoming sectors.\\nThis lack ofattachment to the region on the partofthe new\\nmanagement strata(andconsequently the lack of challenge to the TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 199\\noldhegemony) isrelatedonceagainto theorganisation of\\nproduction - to the satelliteandproduction-only statusofmuch\\nof theincoming industry (they don\\'t need the local university), the\\nassociated lack ofseniormanagement, to the fact thatindividual\\nmanagers see thejob-andthus the region - as only one step in a\\ncareerstructure, andto thegreaterdiversity oftheincoming new\\nindustries (Segal, 1979,pp. 217 -8). So, while it is certainly truethat\\nthe whole notionof a local establishment beingdominated by\\nanything called\\'regional capital\\'is on the wane, to the extentthat\\nsuch aphenomenon doescontinue to exist it is still firmly in the\\nhandsofthecapitalbased in the previous spatialdivision of labour.\\n* * *Incontrast, whatremainsofthetraditional pettybourgeoisie has\\nsuffered a decline, in particular aslocally-owned shopsarepushed\\nout of the marketby bigretailing firms. This, ofcourse,is not a new\\nprocess, and it isone which isat different stages in different regions.\\nInsouthWales,Humphrys (1972) identifies the 1960sas the decade\\nwhen the invasion reallytookoff(p. 56). In so far, then, as the old\\npettybourgeoisie can nolongerreproduce itself as a class andin so\\nfar as it is being replaced by the wage labourofchain-stores, there is\\na process of proletarianisation going on. But this is not an aspectof\\nchangeof which too much shouldbe made; it is extremely small in\\nscale.\\nThe effects on othernon-working-class stratahave, however,\\nbeenconsiderable. Theincoming industries exhibita more ad\\xad\\nvanced division of labourin the sense of the separation ofcontrol\\nfromproduction . They have longerhierarchies ofadministration\\nandcontrol;topmanagers can bedistinguished from a whole series\\nofmiddleranks.It is,however, mainly middleand lower manage\\xad\\nment which is based in these areas. Thecombination ofthis\\nincreasing separation offunctions with the growing centralisation\\nofcapitalmeans, as we have seen, thatmoreandmoreregions are\\nsubject to externalcontroland the coalfield areasare noexception.\\nThecombination of their pre-existing economic peripherality and\\ntheir lack ofattractions eitherenvironmental orcultural- forupper\\nmanagement - means thatthefunctions ofrealeconomic controlof\\nthe means ofproduction, andsomeofthoseofpossession, are\\ncarriedon elsewhere. This is true ofall theincoming sectorsinthat\\nthey are all largely subject to \\'external control\\'.Further, in those\\nindustries where there is also a production hierarchy, it is themore\\n\\'professional\\' functions ,thosewithhigherstatusandgreater 200SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nindividual jobcontrol,which can be, and are, centralised away from\\nthese regions. In terms ofWright\\'s analysis these people would\\nprecisely fall into the category ofsemi-autonomous employees,\\noccupying acontradictory location between proletariat and petty\\nbourgeoisie. The upperechelonsofthemanagerial hierarchy on the\\notherhandoccupy a contradictory locationbetweenproletariat and\\nbourgeoisie, thoughwith a far greateraffinity to the latterthan to\\nthe former. The development ofthe division oflabour, which means\\nthatthesefunctions come to be performed byseparate groupsof\\npeople with identifiable social-class characteristics, has enabled also\\nthegeographical separation, and removal, oftheelements of\\nconception andcontrol.\\nThefunctions oflow-level technocrats and low and middle\\nmanagement have, however, tended to locate within these regions\\nof direct production . To a large extent this geographical locationis\\nnecessitated by the natureoftheirfunctional relationto the process\\nofproduction. Whatit isimportant to note here, however, is that\\nthe very fact oftheseparation-out ofthese functions through the\\ndeveloping division oflabourhascontributed to ablurringofthe\\nformerstarkness ofthecapital-labour confrontation in these\\nregions. Thus, there has been a growthin these regions ofmiddle\\nmanagement andtechnocratic stratathroughthe very emergence of\\nseparate functions.\\nHere the question of\\'regionalisation \\' comes in. These middle\\nmanagers andtechnocrats are less likely to live on the coalfield\\nitself.Spatialreorganisation within these areas, and their integra\\xad\\ntion with the wider region, is partand parcel of social reorganisa\\xad\\ntion. InrelationtosouthWales, Rees and Lambert (1979) write:\\n\\'Thedivision and polarisation between the valley communities and\\notherpartsofSouthWales have a clear class dimension . Hence, it is\\narguable thatthe changes thathavetakenplace in the natureofthe\\neconomy in SouthWales and the consequent shifts in population\\nhave resulted in what may be termed the \"embourgeoisement\" of\\nthesettlements ofthecoastalplain. It is here thatthosepartsofthe\\nStateadministration which have been moved from London are\\nlocated; it is here thatthe many immigrants ofmanagerial and\\nexecutive level who have come with UK or multinational firms to\\nwork for a spell in the region find homes\\'(pp. 33-4). Given the\\nfunctions which they perform, middlemanagement andproduction\\xad\\nbasedtechnicians , unlike top management andstrategicRand0,\\ncannotremove themselves entirely from the region, from the place The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 20I\\nofactualproduction . Butwithinthe region, the separation-out of\\nthese functions has been accompanied bygeographical and social\\nseparation. Therelation between socialdistance fromactual\\nproduction andgeographical distance could not be clearer.\\nTheabsolute increase in the wider region is important to note, for\\nit is often claimed thatone of the main problems ofthe wider\\nregions of which the coalfields are a partis their lack ofwhite\\xad\\ncollar,managerial and technical jobs. As we saw in Chapter 3, this\\nis to miss the point.Whathashappened isthatthepushingforward\\nofthe division oflabourhas both increased the absolute numberof\\nsuchjobsin these regions and at the same time, because of the\\nremovalofthe top-level functions, increased the difference between\\nthese and more centralregions. Similarly, what has actuallybeen\\nlost to these regions is not a type of job(since such jobshardly\\nexisted before) but a function within the overall social relations of\\nproduction .Reconceptualising things in this way also highlights the\\nambiguity ofdemands focusing solely on geographical location\\n(demanding thereturnofownership andcontrolto \\'Wales\\' or \\'the\\nnorth-east\\', etc.), and the politics of regional consensus discussed\\nearlier.Fundamentally, the issue is about,not the geographical\\nlocation of control,but its class location\\'\\nThe newness ofsome aspects of the incoming industries has also\\nbeenexaggerated . Muchofthe political debateaboutthese regions\\nisconcerned with the impact of\\'external control\\', butimportant\\nsegments of production in these areas have been subject to external\\ncontrolfor a long time. In centralScotland, and more particularly\\ninsouthWales, there is the centuries-old factofa semi-colonial\\nrelation with England. This was not the case in the north-east of\\nEngland, and it does seem thatit is in this region thatsomething\\ncalled regional capital,localcontrol, can most clearly and until\\nmost recently be identified. But in none ofthe regions is external\\ncontrolnew. On the coalfields production has for decades been\\nsubject to the external controlofanationalised industry based in\\nLondon. Given the way thatnationalised industries have been\\norganised, the top functions ofownership andmanagement have\\nbeen carried on outside these regions since the end ofthe Second\\nWorld War. Decisions aboutlong-term investment (and disinvest\\xad\\nment), the top levels ofcontrolandsupervision, decisions about\\nwagenegotiations, all haveemanated fromLondon, and it is there\\nthattheassociated socialstratahave tended to be located. The fact\\nof external controlis not new. Whatare new are some ofits 202SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nimplications for regional social composition. The social hierarchy of\\nadministration andcontrolin theincoming industries is more\\ndeveloped andextended, andthedevelopment ofproduction\\nhierarchies, with their associated patternsofsocialdifferentiation,\\nis a recent innovation .Stateownership ofthetraditional industries\\nin the wider regions has been extended to steel and shipbuilding.\\n\\'External control\\'isbothincreasing inimportance andchanging in\\nitsimplications .\\n* * *But theincorporation ofthesepartsof thecountry intodifferent\\nspatialstructures ishavingitsmostimportant effectson the\\nstructure andorganisation, the lives and the politics, ofthe work\\xad\\ning class. In particular , the old form ofcoherence, organisation and\\nstrengthofthis class is being undermined .\\nFirst,the size and structure of the class are undergoing change.\\nMostobviously, over the longer periodthere has been a consider\\xad\\nable decline in the traditional workforce, as a result bothofmassive\\noutmigration andofdeliberate policiesoftransfer, particularly for\\nminers(Department ofEmployment andProductivity , 1970; Rees\\nand Rees, 1981). To the extent thatthismigration was selective it\\nalsoentailedsomechangein thecomposition oftheworking class\\nthatremained . And while this traditional workforce has been\\nshrinking andchanging ,otherfundamental shifts have been under\\nway. Most importantly, capitalist relations ofproduction are being\\ncontinually extended to people who were previously non-wage\\xad\\nearners,and inparticular tomarriedwomen. So the economically\\xad\\nactiveworking class isexpanding in a new direction .Itis also\\nbecoming moreinternally differentiated. Theincreasing employ\\xad\\nmentofwomen isone aspect; the greatervarietyofnewindustries is\\nanother. Therehas also been an expansion ofwagerelations in\\nclerical and service work - in otherwords, into non-manual labour.\\nWhile the overall size oftheeconomically-active working class is\\ngrowing, therefore , itsprevious coherence andhomogeneity are\\nbeingdisrupted.\\nThus,although forcapitalism this hasrepresented expansion, for\\nthe local working class itrepresents a moredramatic change.Not\\nonly are women now increasingly absorbed intocapitalist wage\\nrelations, but with the continued decline of the basic industries,\\noldermen are increasingly excluded from them. Table5.2 shows\\nhowimportant thesechangeswere over the 1960s. Socially, this has\\nproduced disruption and some confusion.

In the valleys ofsouthWales the\\noncecoherent andclosedcommunit iesofthe pits have for long been\\nundergoing a process ofintegration intoadifferent, more compli\\xad\\ncatedandheterogeneous networkofspatialrelations. Muchofthis\\ninternalspatialrestructuring startedwith the decline and reorgani\\xad\\nsationof the old industries ,particularly coalandsteel. In these\\nindustries, attempts to increase productivity have involved both\\nconcentration into larger units and often fairly substantial intrar\\xad\\negional shifts (for instance, in steel,towardsthecoast). Muchofthe\\nNewTownspolicy, an important partofthestrategyofspatial\\nreorganisation, has also been associated with the declineand\\n\\'rationalisation\\' of theolderindustries .\\nThelocation patternoftheincoming industry has also been very\\ndifferent fromthatofthe old. H umphrys (1972)pointsto two main\\nelements in this patterninsouthWales. On the one hand,the large\\nfactories lie isolated on greenfield sites outsidethe towns: spacious,\\nsingle-storey, windowless boxes housing modern flow-line manu- 212SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nfacturing techniques . On the otherhand, thesmallerfactories\\nclustertogether aroundthesharedinfrastructure ofbleaktrading\\nestates.Itis an \\'industrial landscape sharedby many Development\\nAreas.\\nThe most favoured locationofthe newer industries is close to a\\nmotorway. In Wales, by the mid-1970s, 70 per cent ofall the\\noverseas-owned establishments had been set up within ten miles of\\namotorway (Davies and Thomas, 1976, p. 57). Contact with \\'the\\noutsideworld\\'is moreimportant thanlinks within the region.\" It is\\nan evident reflection ofthe growing role of these areas as a place of\\nproduction ofconsumer-related goodsfor the UK and the EC. Many\\nofthe new manufacturing industries produce consumer goods or\\ncomponents ofconsumer goods for mass markets. But lessthan4 per\\ncentofthe total British population lives insouthWales; the major\\nmarketsare in the midlands andsouth-east ofEngland. Inputsand\\ncomponents, too, often come from outsidethe region. The \\'transport\\ndemands ofthe new industrial economy couldhardlybemore\\ndifferent from those the inherited transport network grew up to\\nserve\\'(Humphrys, p. 66). The completion ofthe Severn Bridge \\xad\\ncarrying amotorway - in 1966wassymbolic ofthischanging relation\\nbetween the economies ofthe areas which it linked.\\nIn all this restructuring ofspatialrelations within the region, the\\nState,bothcentralandlocal,playedanimportant role.The\\nindustrial estates(thepublicly-owned ones), the motorways and\\nthe New Townswere allStateorganised and financed - thoughthey\\nprovided privateindustry with some lucrative projects. In amore\\ngeneral way, too, this provision by theStateofthe new, and\\nmassive, conditions ofproduction wasalready(apart,thatis, from\\nregional policyincentives) aconsiderable subsidy toprivate\\nindustry.Hudson (1979) has documented theprocess - the\\nreorganisation ofspatialformthrough theState\\'suseof\\'deva\\xad\\nlorisedcapital\\'- for the case ofWashington New Town in the\\nnorth-east ofEngland. Verysimilarshifts,disruptions and deser\\xad\\ntions(andaccompanying political battles)have also taken place in\\nsouthWales - the move from the valleys to the valley-mouths and\\nthecoastalplain being the most obvious, and at the broadest level,\\nand closely paralleling the west-east shift in the north-east of\\nEngland.Cooke(198Ia)pointsto anincreasing geographical as\\nwell as social polarisation in Wales.\\nApartfromproviding a moreappropriate spatialstructure and\\nnew physical infrastructure, the New Townstrategy has been a TheEffects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 213\\nmeansofreorganising thelabourforce in a way which would meet\\ntherequirements of the new and changing industrial structure.\\nHousing policy can also work to this end. In the north-east, for\\nexample, the distribution ofnew stock - mainly in Washington New\\nTown -particularly affected new households lookingfor a place to\\nlive for the first time, and the patternofin-migration andof\\nDevelopment Corporation lettingscontributed to a bias towards\\nyounger people.

The patterns of newhousingandofjob\\nopportunities may be mutually reinforcing inexcluding older\\nredundant men from further\\'economically-active\\' life.\\nSo thespatialreorganisation of these regionsprovides new\\nconditions foraccumulation notjustin a physical infrastructure\\nsense but also through thepartwhich it plays in social restructur\\xad\\ning.Itis aphenomenon which Rees and Lambert (1979)andRees\\nand Rees (1981)refer to in their discussions ofsouthWales. It is\\nalsopartof thebreakdown ofpreviously-definable subregions and\\nlocalities.\\nForlocalpopulations all this has often meanteitherresidential\\nchangeor having to travel much furtherto work, or both.Manyof\\ntheoldersettlements have become essentially dormitory towns. A\\nneweconomic andsocialsubregionalisation emerges .Froma\\nsituation wheremostpeople lived close to work andeven walked\\nthere, there is now a complex patternofcommuting .

Hudson (1979)\\ndescribes some ofthecomplexities of thecommuting patternwhich\\nhas now evolved. And the situation is similar in otherold coal\\xad\\nfields.The FinancialTimes reported 5000peopletravelling each day\\nintoGlenrothes.

It is\\noverwhelmingly tomanufacturing and service jobs.\\nWith this social diversification andspatialdislocation has come a\\nbreakdown, too, in the old, predictable politics. The long-held\\nhegemony oftheLabour Partymachine and the ideology of\\nlabourism isunderchallenge.\\nIn Wales this began as early as the 1960swith the growthof Plaid\\nCymru. Here \\'devolution\\' and nationalism had been developing as\\nelements oftheregionalist consensus since the 1960s;they were \\'not\\nasuddenphenomenon bornof 1970\\'s crisis\\' (Rees and Lambert,\\n1979, p. 23). And in the ideology ofthatnationalism \\'thevalleys\\'\\nplayed a centralrole:\\'oneofthecentralthemesofthe Public\\nInquiryon theproposed New Town at Llantrisant was the extent to\\nwhich the development woulddestroywhat was assumed to be the\\n\"wayof life\"characteristic of theindustrial valleys.

Cornwall, too, 216SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nhas been on the receiving end of the process. And here the social\\nstructure into which the new industries have been implanted could\\nhardlybe more ofacontrast. Insteadofthecombination ofState\\nownership , bigindustry andworking class,Cornwall has much\\nmoresignificant proportions ofsmallindustry andself-employment ,\\nandamuchlowerimportance oflargeindustry andhighly\\xad\\norganised ,relatively well-paid maleworking class. All this, of\\ncourse, in some measure again results from the very different role\\nwhich this partofthecountryhas played so far in the UK economy,\\ninotherwords its previous locationin a wider territorial division of\\nlabour.\\nThe class structure ofCornwall is notdominated by anindustrial\\nproletariat. Insectoral terms, its historically-important industries\\nhave been agriculture, mining and tourism. Only the second of\\nthese,together with some small presence ofshipbuilding and\\nengineering, form a basis for the kindofunionisation which exists\\nin the coalfields, and even then these industries have been on a far\\nsmallerscale.\\nMoreover , whileCornwall is like the old coalfield areas in having\\nhadhistorically a very low female activity rate, the reasons for it\\nhave been very different. TheCornish CountyStructure planners\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b) analyse this in detail and argue\\nthatthemostimportant explanations are: first, a straightforward\\nlackofworkopportunities , second, the availability ofseasonal\\nworkduringthesummer (which they argue is probably afactor\\nreducing the willingness ofmarried women to seek year-round\\nemployment) ,third, the fairly high overall level ofunemployment ,\\nandfourth,thegeographical natureoftheCounty. This last, the\\ndistribution of muchofthepopulation in villages and small towns,\\nisarguedto be \\'perhaps the most important factoraffecting married\\nfemaleactivityrates\\'(p. 99).Itlengthens theaveragejourney to\\nworkand this in turnparticularly affects women as a result ofthe\\nrestricted publictransport facilities and oftheir having lessaccess to\\nthe\\'family\\'car. It is, therefore, often more feasible for women \\'to\\nhelp on the farm, take in summerguests or to be less well offand\\nstayathome\\'(p. 99). Forsimilarreasons thisgeographical\\nstructure reduces not only the numberbut also the range ofjobs\\nwithin easy access. The continuing influence on activityrates of\\ntheseproblems ofaccessibility is confirmed by thevariations within\\nCornwall between urbanandruralareas: \\'Rates were up to 8 -9%\\nlower in ruralareasthanin the towns in 1971\\'. It is a clear example The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 2I7\\nof theinteraction between geographical forms and patriarchical\\nstructures. It is of course probable that,precisely because ofthe\\nhigherproportion thannationally ofsmallcapitaland self-employ\\xad\\nment,particularly inagriculture , more women were involved in\\neconomic productive activity than the statistics show. But this kind\\nof work has been declining dramatically - between 196I and 1971\\nthenumberoffemaleworkers actually registered in agriculture\\ndeclined by 12 per cent (while nationally there was an 1I per cent\\nincrease) (Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b). So the labour-reserve\\nwhich was one oftheattractions toincoming industry was\\n\\'produced\\' by a very different social history from the apparently\\nsimilarlabour-reserve notthatmany miles away in southWales.\\nItwas,moreover, a reserve with different characteristics. A\\nmarried woman in this region was less likely to be \\'just\\'a wife\\nandhousekeeper to a\\'breadwinner \\' and more likely to be involved\\nin some form ofnon-domestic labour; keeping a bed-and-breakfast\\nboarding house, maybe, or doing (paid or unpaid)work on the\\n\\'family\\' farm. In both the coal-fields and Cornwall oneofthe\\nattractions toindustry has been a reserve oflabourwhich - so\\nmanagement hopes - will be relatively cheap, but above all non\\xad\\ncombative. Inboththese areas the reserves are in large measure\\ncomposed ofwomen. But the vast varietyofways in which\\npatriarchy works, and in particular itsgeographical variations,\\nmeansthattheprocesses bywhichsuchcharacteristics are\\nproduced, andtherefore theindicesonwhichthey can be\\nmeasured , also vary widely. While manymarried women in\\nCornwall ~aynot have been confined to the home and to domestic\\nlabour, and may even have appeared inofficialstatistics as\\n\\'economically active\\', they have none the less rarely been working\\nincapitalist wage relations and even more rarely within any labour\\nprocess likely to provide the basis for solidarity andworkplace\\norganisation . In theCornisheconomy, especially thatpartin which\\nwomen were directly involved, a kind ofpetty-bourgeois self\\xad\\nsufficiency and independence had been the orderofthe day. Such\\nsocialcharacteristics are very different from those ofthe coalfields,\\nbut they lead to a crucial similarity - they providewhat seems like\\ninfertilegroundfortradeunionorganisation .\\nCornwall also differs from the old coalfield areasin having been\\nhistorically a low-wage economy. This appearsto be the result of\\nindustrial structure, low relative wages within thatstructure, and\\ntheavailability ofseasonal work. Seasonal work provides extremely 218SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nlow(annual) wages to those who have to relyon it altogether, but it\\ncan also have the effect of subsidising otherwages, so thatpeople\\ncansupplement the income from their regularemployment by\\ntemporary orpart-time jobs. On the otherhand,if the pay from\\ntheir main jobswere higher, the need for this might not arise\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b, p. 40). Such employment may,\\ninotherwords, mean thatwages in othersectors can be held down.\\nDepending on thenumberofpeople who have only seasonal work,\\nit could also produce a divergence between average wages per job\\nand average income per head. Itisparallelto thesubsidisation of\\nwages in capitalist firms by subsistence farming in peasantareas.\"\\nFinally, the structure oftheownership ofproduction isdifferent\\ninCornwall. Neitherlocally-based big capitalnorState-ownership\\nis of much significance. In contrast, smallcapitaland self-employ\\xad\\nment are far more important thanin the coalfields. As a proportion\\nofthepopulation, self-employed peopleare 2.5 timesmore\\nimportant inCornwall thannationally, andCornwall has been\\nand still is much more dependent than the economy as a whole on\\nprofitsfrom such sources and from professional earnings (Cornwall\\nCountyCouncil, I976b, p. 41), much ofitcomingfromagriculture\\nand from tourist-related activities.\\nThe impact, or \\'the combination oflayers\\'\\nUntil the 1950s, the manufacturing basisoftheCornish economy\\nwas in decline, but in the mid-1960s this long-term trendwas\\nreversed and manufacturing firms began moving into the County.\\nThein-migration reached a peak in 1969and 1970, but in the mid\\xad\\n1970s was still well above the figure for the mid-I960s. The new\\nemployment is verysimilartothatarriving over the same periodin\\nthe coalfield areas. Two-thirds ofit is inbranchplants,which in\\nturnare the element most heavily biassed towards female employ\\xad\\nment(about60 per cent). Manyof themanufacturing jobsare in\\ninstrument and electrical engineering, and new jobsin services have\\nalso been important .!\" The largest factories (in employment terms)\\nhave gone to the towns (themselves small), but the biggest impact\\nhas been in rural areas.\\nSo what, then, ofthe effects oftheentryof these new forms of\\nemployment , and how do they compare with the impactin the old\\ncoalfield areas? The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 219\\nDescriptively, someoftheimplications havebeensimilar:the size\\nofthepopulation engaged in wage labourhasincreased, again\\nprimarily becauseoftheincorporation ofmorewomen(almostall\\nofthemmarried women) intotheworkforce, andunemployment in\\nsomeareashasincreased.\\nBut it is the differences which are striking.\\nIn the first place, the implications for theworking classarefar\\nlessdramatic.

First,in terms ofitscurrentemployment of\\nworkers, thisgroupisunimportant incomparison to thebranch\\nplantsestablished by bigger firms (Cornwall County Council,\\n1976b;Perry,1979).Moreover, although thecombination of\\ndeclineofold and influx ofnew has indeed produced achangein\\nthenatureofself-employment andsmallcapital, it isnota\\nstraightforward shift from traditional pettybourgeoisie toprofit\\xad\\nmaximisation andaccumulation . A study ofthe \\'independent small\\xad\\nfirmmanufacturing sector\\' in the countydistinguished between\\ndifferent typesofsmall firm on the basis ofwhetherthey were local\\norimmigrant andwhether they were new or existing companies.\\nWhatisinteresting isthat,although there were certainly contrasts\\ninattitudes togrowth,noneofthegroupsconformed to the classic\\nmodelofcapitalist accumulation .Certainly, thetraditional sector\\ntended to be of the \\'simple-reproduction\\' variety, but the new\\nentrants do not live up to the fashionable imageofthe striving\\nentrepreneur either. Thus\\nDifferences in thegroups\\'attitude towards growthwere\\ndiscovered. Established localentrepreneurs tended to show satisfi\\xad\\ncingratherthanoptimising behaviour and to be people-rather\\nthanprofit-oriented . New local entrepreneurs werecraft-rather\\nthanmarket-oriented. Owner-managers ofincoming complete\\ntransfers,attracted by acombination ofregional aid in a pleasant\\nenvironment, were not strongly growth-oriented, and were the\\ngroupmostconscious ofcapital-transfer problems onretirement.\\nThe new incoming entrepreneurs came closest to the stereotype of\\naprofit-maximising entrepreneur, but even this groupcontained\\nmanyredundant ordisenchanted executives from larger corpora\\xad\\ntions,stronglyattracted toCornwall by theenvironment.\\nThussomething ofasemi-retirement cultureprevailed, but, of\\ncourse, the typical small firm everywhere stays small, and there is\\nnoreasonwhy itshouldexpandjustto suit the wishes ofregional\\nplanners. Boswell\\'s (1972)studies ofsmall firms in the Midlands ,\\n(assumed to be one ofthe more growth-oriented regions) led him\\ntoconclude thatonlyabouthalfofthem were expansion-minded :\\noursurvey would suggest a proportion thatwas a good deal less\\nforCornwall (Perry, 1979, pp. 19-20). TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 221\\nItisworthat leastconsidering whether the very fact ofsuch a\\nresponse to this kind ofenvironmental attraction (asopposed to the\\nmore\\'social\\',andeconomically morecentral,environment ofthe\\n\\'sunbelt\\') on thepartofownersofcapitalmightimply a relative\\nlack ofinterestinprofit-maximisation . InPerry\\'ssurvey,allthe new\\nentrants had first got the idea duringaholidayvisit to the County. I I\\nCertainly , thisgroupis unlikely to become the basis of an extension\\nto a local, truly capitalist , class; still less the basis for locally\\xad\\ncontrolled accumulation . Similarly, the implications ofthis kind\\nofentrantforemployment growthin thefuture, andtherefore a\\nfurtherexpansion oftheworking class, are notmajor.Finally, and\\nfor all the same reasons, it does not providemuch basis for self\\xad\\nreliantregional growth. Indeed, even worse, it was precisely this\\nkindofin-migrant which was mostsubjecttofluctuations in\\nemployment as a result ofchanging macroeconomic conditions\\n(Cornwall CountyCouncil, 1976b). In particular , they were more\\nsubject to decline in the recession of the 1970s thanwerebranch\\nplants.Certainly , astrategybased on these kinds offirms is unlikely\\nto be a viable basis for regional economic resuscitation. V\\n.Thisconsideration ofthenatureofin-migration pointsto\\nanother contrast between the changes going on in Cornwall and\\nthoseunderway in the coalfields. In both, as we have seen, there is\\nagrowthofthe \\'new middle class\\', takenat its widest, but the\\ncomposition of thisexpanding socialstratumisdifferent in the two\\ncases. In particular, too,they are different intheirrelationto the\\nregion. In Cornwall, thegroupconsists importantly ofthe self\\xad\\nemployed andsmallemployers. They are defined in terms of their\\nrelationto theownership of(small-scale) production. Thegrowth\\nofthisgroupinCornwall is,moreover , very much a reflection ofits\\ndesire to be there. It has been attracted by thecharacteristics of the\\nregion itself. The situation in thecoalfields couldhardlybe more\\ndifferent. Here, the dominant elements ofthe new white-collar\\nmiddle class consistofmiddlemanagement in largecorporate and\\nStateorganisations. Veryoftenthey, too, have been drawnin from\\noutside. But in this case it is rarely a voluntary move, rarely a result\\noftheattractions ofthe region; all too oftenthe region is merely a\\ntransient ,andoftenunwanted ,staging-post in a climb up the\\ncorporate hierarchy .\\nBut the main difference in impact between the two regions is that,\\nwhile in the heavy-indu stry areas capitalhas not been adversely\\naffected by the entry of the new industries , inCornwall it seems to 222SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nhave witnessed the process with some horror.The most important\\nboneofcontention concerns competition forlabour,and specifi\\xad\\ncally wages. Cornwall has for a long time been a low-wage area,\\nand theStructure PlanReportsbemoan the fact thatthejobsbeing\\ncreatedthere in the 1960shave done little to change this. One ofthe\\nrecommendations ofthe Plan is to createconditions to make it\\neasierfor women to do paid work.TheCornwall Industrial\\nDevelopment Association is the main, and vocal, representative of\\nlocally-based capital,mostofit small, and including somealready\\xad\\nestablished in-migrants. Its reply is unequivocal. It agrees that\\nwomen have to travel furtherto work than men. This, in CIDA\\'s\\nopinion, \\'seems ...to conflict with the naturalpreference ofthe\\npeople\\'(p. 49).Itagrees with the Council thatthe difficulty women\\nhave in getting to work is unlikely to be overcome \\'unless either\\nearnings increase so thatmore wives can affordtheir own trans\\xad\\nport[!],or public transport services are increased withoutlarge fare\\nrises\\'. This, thunders CIDA,\\'is precisely the kind ofspurious\\n\"growth\" which we seek to avoid. The problem, as we see it, is not\\nto bring in more female-intensive factory jobs; the problem isto\\ntake work to women to carry out at or near home\\' (p. 49). In other\\nwords, the aim should be to open up the labourmarketratherthan\\nadd to the demandforlabourand so push up wages. Whatseems to\\nbe going on here, in otherwords, is a tussle over spatialform, in\\nwhich the ideology ofthe family is invoked, but which is actually\\naboutwho taps a laboursupply and how. Internalspatialstructure\\nisimportant in this conflict. CIDArejects all notionsofgrowth\\npoles, \\'growth triangles\\' andindustrial estates - all, presumably,\\ndesigned to collect together sufficient labourandprovideadequate\\ninfrastructure for relatively large incoming plants. Incontrast, the\\ndemands oflocalindustry are foropening up access to the in-situ\\nlabourmarketsofsmall villages.\\nTheargument also takes place over aggregate supply-demand\\nrelations. TheStructure Planrecommends thatmoreopportunities\\nshouldbeprovided for people to increase their earnings and, quite\\nexplicitly, thatthepressure ofdemand forlabourshouldbe\\nincreased . All this goes down very badly with the Cornwall\\nIndustrial Development Association. The findings oftheStructure\\nPlan are based on a detailed analysis ofthe causes oflow pay and in\\nparticular oftherelationbetween pay and activity rates, as it might\\noperateinCornwall . The analysis pointsoutthatinCornwall both\\nfemale activity rate and average female wages are relatively low. It TheEffectson Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations 223\\nshowsthatit is possible for employers to offer lower wages thanin\\nmanyotherplaces because there is a higher proportion of women\\npotentially able to work but not actually working, andhence less\\npressure ofdemand forlabour(p. 45). In reply, CIDA,in a\\nsubstantial document on regional policy andtheCornwall Struc\\xad\\nture Plan, mountsasustained attackonbranchplantsemploying\\nwomen and owned by big capital.Forwhile itarguesstrongly for\\nmore high-level technical andadministrative employment, more\\nunskilled andsemi-skilled jobsrepresent toCIDAonlymore\\ncompetition forlabour.Unlike the dominant elements ofcapital\\nin theheavy-industry regions, these industries are still locally-owned\\nandbased.Theyhavenotbeennationalised ,theyhavenot\\ndiversified geographically, they are more likely to overlapin their\\nlabourrequirements with the incoming industry, andthey are just\\nnot large enoughtocompete. Theyarguethat\\nWhatourplanning seeks to avoid is this: individual decisions by\\nonegroupofpeopleunwittingly upsetting theenvironment of\\notherpeople . . . if we encouraged the inflow ofnewCompanies\\nwith high \\'multiplier\\' effects, this would putgreatpressure on the\\nlocallabourmarket(possibly causingsomeotherfirms to become\\nunprofitable), more people would be attracted in to fill the jobsat\\nenhanced salaries, andin a recession the problems would all be\\nmagnified as the process went into reverse (CIDA1977, p. 102).\\nTheprovision ofmorejobsand/orhigher wages andsalariescan\\nonlyaddto thealready-strongpressures arisingfrominwards\\nmigration and are not therefore prime objectives. Indeed,it is\\ndoubtful whether Cornwall couldeverhave a high wage econo\\xad\\nmy: itwouldlead to a loss in profitability andadditional\\nunemployment, andhence would be self-defeating (p. 119).\\nOtherreservations aboutattracting newindustry also find expres\\xad\\nsion.CIDAisunreservedly pro-market andwaryofStateinterven\\xad\\ntion.Keegan(1980)characterises theregional CBI(SouthWest) as\\nthemostright wing oftheCBI\\'sregions:\\'theland where they still\\nbelieve in the phoenix\\'.Moreover, givenwhathasalreadybeen said\\naboutthenatureof small capitaland the new pettybourgeoisie in\\nthispartofthecountry, it is not surprising thatenvironmental\\nissues play a role in local politics. Cornwall had the only county\\ncouncil with an Ecology Partymember. Whatisironicisthatsuch 224SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconsiderations areprobably moreimportant to thein-migrant (but\\nalreadyarrived) self-employed andsmallentrepreneurs andalso,of\\ncourse, tosomeprofessionals ,such as estateagents,thanthey are to\\nlong-established localcapital.Indeed,CIDA\\'s initialformation (in\\n1974) was in partinresponse to a focus on environmentalism and\\nconservation whichhadtendedto reflect all industry in abadlight\\n(Wight, 1981).Environmental arguments are,however,nonetheless\\nusefulthingstomobilise in theoverallresistance totoomuch\\nincoming newindustry.

The overall patternofchangehas been contributed to\\nby the decline ofsomeindustries, thegrowthofothersand the\\ndevelopment ofnewspatialstructures in yetothers.

These\\nvariations inpartreflected changes in the economic situation over\\nthatperiod. But thatwas not all they reflected, for there were also,\\nover the same period,majorchanges in politics, in political alliances\\nand innational ideology and temperament. So it has notjustbeen\\nchanging economic circumstances which have been important but\\nalso changes in the way in which these economic pressures were\\nfiltered,moulded andtranslated through theprevailing political\\nand ideological climate.\\nThe endofthe long boom saw both the widening ofcracks in the\\nnational economy and the re-emergence of regional inequality as a\\npoliticalproblem. Since then there has at the political level been a\\nshifting search for a way out, both ofeconomic decline and ofthe\\nimpasse of political class stalemate .

And in each ofthesecontrasting economic-political\\nconjunctures ,\\'geography\\' and uneven development have played a\\ndifferent role.\\nThe first major section of this chapteranalyses this shifting\\npolitical and economic climate and the role ofgeography within it.\\nThe period as a whole isdivided very broadlyinto three: first, there\\nwas theattemptatmodernisation throughstructural intervention,\\nfrom the early sixties to the early seventies. This was followed by\\nthe relative political eclecticism of the mid-seventies, a period of\\n\\'holding thefort\\',but with a gradualshift within it, heralding the\\nthird sub -period, in which a social and political philosophy of\\nindividualism, competition and themarkethas been associated with\\nthedominance ofa strategy, in economic terms, ofprivate-sector,\\nmarket-based monetarism .\\nThe section deals with each oftheseperiodsinturn,and analyses\\ntheeconomic, and some ofthepolitical, determinants of this\\nshiftingpatternof change. It also pointsto thedifferent roleof\\n\\'geography\\' in each of these contrasting economic and political 228 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nconjunctures. Whatemerges clearly is that,not only has each of the\\nstrategies adopted in these different periodsfailed to \\'rescuethe\\nBritisheconomy\\', onanybody\\'s terms, but each has contributed \\xad\\nthoughindifferent ways - to perpetuating formsofgeographical\\ninequality .\\nBylookingagain at the economy and society as a whole, picking\\nup thestoryweintroduced at thebeginning ofChapter 4, and\\nattempting totakeseriously ourearlierstrictures that\\'the\\neconomic\\' does not arriveraw at the factory gate, these analyses\\npulltogether otheraspectsofthebackcloth to theshiftsin\\nindustries (investigated inChapter 4)andinareas(seeChap\\xad\\nter 5).Foras we have said, the \\'layers\\' within which particular\\nlocalities areembedded arenotonlyeconomic ; they are also\\npolitical andcultural.

This was, moreover, a\\nperiodwhen the world economy was still growing, and when there\\nwas still therefore much more roomformanoeuvre thanthere was\\nto beafter1973---4.Politically, too, theperiodwasdistinctive . Both\\nmainpartieshadacommitment tostructural intervention in Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 229\\nindustry. The 1964 election was foughtaroundthequestion of\\nwhichpartycould most speedily modernise theproduction baseof\\ntheeconomy. Itwasprobably theperiodwhen the British State\\ncamenearesttoholdingtogether aconsensus . Theeconomy was to\\nbesavedbyadvanced technology, modern management and\\n\\'rationalisation\\' .Inreturnthere was to be a measureofreform.It\\nwas astrategy founded on anattempt toconstruct an alliance\\nbetween big, private,\\'modern\\' capitalandLabour\\'s base in the\\nmanualworking classand,inpart,thetechnocratically orientated\\n\\'middlestrata\\'.Tothatextenttheheartoftheperiodwasthatof the\\nLabouradministration from 1964 to 1970, but as a whole it runs\\nfrom the earlier Conservative political and ideological shift towards\\nintervention, \\'planning\\', andincorporation oftheunions, for\\nexample throughtheestablishment ofNEDO,to theuttercollapse\\n(afterthe Selsdon interlude) in 1973-4.\\nThisattempted \\'alliance\\' was not between the whole ofcapital\\nand the whole of labour. As far as capitalwasconcerned the\\nleadingparticipants cameprimarily from big privateinterests in\\nmanufacturing industry. Asuccession oftheirmoreeminent\\nrepresentatives passedthrough Stateandpara-Stateorganisations.\\nArnoldWeinstock ,chairofGEC,epitomised theperiod. His style,\\nuncompromisingly profit-maximising andwithoutcommitment to\\nindustrial sector,region or workforce, contrasted sharplywiththat\\nin much of the rest ofBritishindustry and was proclaimed by\\nbusiness and government alike to be the type ofmanagement which\\ncould save the economy . Theemphasis was on size and modernity .\\nSmall,\\'old-fashioned\\' capitalwasmarginal to thestrategy, and\\nindeed there is evidence ofopposition from thatpartofcapital,at\\nleast to specific measures (see, forinstance, Jessop, 1979,p. 33).The\\nMachine ToolTradesAssociation, small old capitalpar excellence.\\nsuccessfully opposed theMinTech scheme to introduce aMachine\\nToolIndustry BoardundertheIndustrial Expansion Act(The\\nEconomist, 20July 1968,p. 60and 12 October 1968,p. 86). Norwas\\nthemodernising strategy given the wholehearted supportofthe\\nbanking sector. Indeed a degree ofpublicconflict occasionally\\nsurfaced between banking andmanufacturing - forinstance in the\\nlatter\\'sdissatisfaction with its financial and investment relationship\\nwith the City, in the oft-referred-to battlebetween the Department\\nofEconomic Affairs and the Treasury, and in the arguments over\\ntheproperty boom of the early 1970sand the notionofunproduc\\xad\\ntiveinvestment (Samuels et al..1975; Massey and Catalano, 1978; 230 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nJessop, 1979). This - capital\\'s armofthe alliance on which the\\nmodernisation strategywas based - was new. The direct representa\\xad\\ntionofmanufacturing industry in theState(forinstance in the\\nshapeoftheDEA)was aninnovation . And as Jessop(1979, p. 28)\\npointsout, until the formation ofthe CHI was sponsored by the\\nLabouradministration in 1965, there was no single peak organisa\\xad\\ntion torepresent industrial capitalin Britain.\\nTheattempttoincorporate theworking class in the strategyfor\\nmodernisation alsoincluded theappointment of\\'itsrepresentatives \\'\\ninStateandpara-State organisations , this, again, being a relatively\\nnewphenomenon (Jessop, 1979; PurdyandPrior, 1979). Harold\\nWilsoncelebrated thisinnovation (which had actuallybegununder\\ntheConservatives) by delivering himself of the following:\\nTheTUChasarrived.Itis anestateof the realm, as real, as\\npotent,as essentially partofthe fabric ofournational life, as any\\nofthe historic Estates.\\nIt isnoteasy for many within a movement thatgrew out of\\nrevolt to accept all the implications ofa rolethatnow iscreative,\\nconsultative and, in the centraleconomic struggle in which this\\nnationis involved, decisive. Influence and powercarrywith them\\nthe duties ofresponsibility. Never has this been more clearly\\nillustrated thanin thehistoricdecision oftheTradesUnion\\nCongress, fifteenmonthsago, to accept the need for an incomes\\npolicy which would relate the planned growthof wages to the\\nachieved growthinproductivity; which, indeed, went further, in\\nthatindividual unions,manyof them of great power, agreed to\\nsurrender to thecentralorganization somepartofthehistoric\\nsovereignty for which they hadbattledforoveracentury\\n(Wilson, 1974, p. 674).\\nThe hope in particular wasthattheunionleaders- andtherebythe\\nmembership - would co-operate bybearingtheimmediate burdens\\noftechnical changeandrestructuring - inotherwords,of\\n\\'modernisation\\'. In return,there was to be a strongelement of\\nsocialdemocratic reform. Just as Stateintervention inindustry was\\nseen in this period in a positive light across much ofthepolitical\\nspectrum,so also, and particularly in theLabourParty,there was a\\ncommitment to theexpansion of the Welfare State. Consistent with\\nthe faith in technology (which was presumed to beneutral) and\\norganisation (which was always seen as comingfrom the top down) Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 231\\nthistookthe form largely ofamajorexpansion oftheStatesector\\nand a range of reforming, ameliorative measures ,ameliorative in\\nmany cases precisely ofthe negative effects for working people\\nwhich\\'modernisation\\' was tobringin itstrain.Theintroduction of\\naredundancy payments act in 1965 was a classic case in point.\\nThethirdelement of the social base on which this strategydrew\\nwas a large section of the white-collar strata.Industry was to be\\nrevitalised bymodern management andtechnology , and social\\nproblems were conceived as being amenable tosolution through\\neducation and\\'rational\\', technocratic planning. TheCentrefor\\nEnvironmental Studieswas one of a wide rangeofinstitutions\\nestablished duringthisperiod(including also the SSRC,London\\nBusiness School and the Open University), andits earlyattempts to\\ncome to grips with urbanandregional problems were, typically for\\ntheperiod,concentrated onbuilding mathematical modelsof\\nspatialinteraction . (This was also, remember , theperiodwhen\\ngeography\\'s self-definition as a discipline centredon theconstruc\\xad\\ntion of \\'a science ofthespatial\\' in the contextofaquantitative\\nrevolution .Intellectual andsociopolitical philosophies fitted per\\xad\\nfectlytogether, and fed offeachother.)In such an atmosphere\\ntechnocrats ,business-school managers andsignificant elements of\\ntheeducational andsocial science community werecentralto the\\nrhetoricofbuilding the new Britain.\\nTheeconomic strategies whichcharacterised this period clearly\\nreflected the allianceon which they were based,andreflected too\\nthebalance ofpowerwithin it. The emphasis was on modern\\nproduction industries , on size andon high technology, and there\\nwas an explicit underplaying oftheprivateservicesectors.Within\\ntheemphasis onproduction industries there were two main foci.\\nFirst,there was to be financial restructuring andtechnological\\nupdating ofprivatemanufacturing , andparticularly ofmodern\\ncapital-goods sectors. Thisstrategywasdirected primarily to those\\nsectorswherebigcapitalwasalready dominant (computers ,\\nelectrical engineering ,cars)andthechanges reinforced that\\ndominance. TherewasNEOO, MinTech, theOEA,aNational\\nPlan.Productivity bargaining wasintroduced andthe Lanc aster\\nHouseConference onproductivity tookplaceamidafanfareof\\npublicity . TheIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation began its life\\nbyrestructuring majorsectors,smoothing the way to the centralisa\\xad\\ntion ofcapital,providing funds for investment. It,too,concentrated\\non the big andthemodern. And it was bothcharacteristics which 232 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmattered. Thedistinction was not simply between big and little\\ncapital.Smallcompanies inhigh-technology sectors and with a\\nreputation for\\'dynamism\\' weresupported .Nuclear Enterprises , at\\nthattime anindependent firm, was certainly small in employment\\nterms, and was owned by two brothers. But it was hardly an old\\xad\\nfashioned family firm. Itwas fast becoming a force in a highly\\ninternational industry. Said the IRC: \\'We are takinga couple of\\nentrepreneurs and backing them\\' (The FinancialTimes, 6December ,\\n1967). In totalcontrast, small old-fashioned capitalin long\\xad\\nestablished industries was completely external to the strategy. In\\nfaceofthe small capitalin wool textiles, the IRC gave up. \\'In\\nindustries where there is little movement, theIRCis helpless. The\\nwoolindustry is a good example. The majority offirms in this\\nextremely fragmented sector are small and family-owned. Their\\nposture is defensive and their interestinmodern management\\nmethods slight\\' (Smith, 1969, p. 93). But the emphasis on size\\nwasinescapable: widereconomic pressures, quiteapartfrom\\ngovernment stimulus, werepushing towards concentration and\\ncentralisation. Therewas amergerboom,especially among\\nalready-large firms (Whittington, 1972),and there was a significant\\nincrease in plantsize.The strictures oftheMonopolies and Mergers\\nCommission werespiritedaway(McClelland , 1972);competition, it\\nwasconfidently asserted, began abroad. There were relatively high\\nlevelsofinvestment , much of it replacement investment (Treasury ,\\n1976)indicating anupdating oftechniques ratherthan a simple\\nextension ofcapacity. Indeed, the rate ofgrowthofoutputbegan to\\nslow while, precisely up until 1973, the ratiobetween the rate of\\ngrowthoflabourproductivity and the rate ofgrowthofoutputwas\\nhigh (Singh, 1977). All this showed up in the employment statistics.\\nThe fastest rate ofemployment growth(number ofjobsperannum)\\ninmanufacturing was in those capital-goods industries based\\naroundnewtechnology ,particularly electronics.\\nThe second side ofthestrategy towards production industries\\nwas \\'rationalisation\\' oftheheavybasicsectors.Therewere\\nprogrammes forshipbuilding, the Devlin Reporton the docks\\nand steel was nationalised , but most ofall there were massive\\nclosures and reorganisation in the pits. Much ofthis, and the huge\\njoblosses which it involved, was carriedthroughwith the effective\\ncompliance ofthetradeunionleadership, thoughtherewas\\nresistance in some industries , such as steel (Cookeand Rees,\\n1981). Overall, this period saw a faster annuallevelofjobloss in Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 233\\nthesesectorsthan was seen in eitherthe first halfofthe sixties or\\nthe restofthe seventies.\\nThestrategy was also clearly reflected in the changes in the\\nserviceindustries. Thegrowthofserviceemployment slowed, in\\npartpossibly due to Selective Employment Tax,itselfareflection of\\nthe policy emphasis onmanufacturing, butthere were considerable\\ndifferences in the rate of employment change between different\\npartsofservices. Two sections dominated thegrowthinabsolute\\ntermsandgrew faster duringthisperiodthanin the years either\\nbefore or after: these were producer servicesandtheStatesector.\\nProducer servicescompletely dominated privatesectorgrowthin\\nserviceemployment, and this was a reflection ofwhatwas going on\\nin the wider economy : acommercial-office boomandaproperty\\nboom(Marquand, 1979,para.1.9), mergers andreorganisation in\\nmanufacturing (para.6.20),and- veryimportantly - thespreadof\\nthecomputer (para. I.I5). The social class implication ofthis was\\nthatthegrowthinemployment in these producer services \\'was\\nalmostentirelyagrowthinhigherlevelmanagerial andprofessional\\nemployment, as was much ofthegrowthin office employment in\\nthesecondary sectortoo...[suggesting] majorchanges in\\norganisational structure andbehaviour accompanying thegrowth\\nin office employment in the 1960s\\' (Marquand, 1979,para.1.15).It\\nwas a clear reflection ofthebroader changes going on in the\\neconomy andoftheemphasis onmodernisation andtechnology .\\nSo, too, was the enormous growthinStateemployment, in this case\\nbeing at least in parta reflection ofthereforming social-democratic\\nelementofthemodernising aIIiance, partofthequid pro quo.\\nPrivateconsumer services slowed in their rate ofemployment\\ngrowth, however, and smaII private-capital services, particularly in\\ndistribution, declined. Although dataaredifficult to come by, it\\nseems likely thatfrom 1964to the early 1970s there was a high rate\\nofmergeractivityin the service sectoralso(Bolton Committee,\\n1971;Marquand, 1979).Puttingthistogether withwhatwe know of\\nthe service industries fromChapter 4, it seems likely thatat least\\npartofthis was associated with the accelerated decline of petty\\xad\\nbourgeois ownership indistribution andmiscellaneous services with\\nthefurtherextension oflargercapitalist firms(Marquand, 1979,\\npara. 1.53 and ch. 7). (Certainly distribution was the only partof\\nthe service sectorwhichexperienced anabsolute decline in self\\xad\\nemployment over the whole periodbetween 1961and1975.) As in\\nthe restoftheeconomy, then, these differential changes within 234 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nservicesclearly reflected boththe overall economic changes and the\\ndifferent elements of the dominant political and economic strategy.\\n* * *\\'Geography\\' was integral to all this. Itwas notjustthatnational-\\nlevel processes were differentially mapped on to the British space\\nbutthatgeographical differentiation, distance and locational mo\\xad\\nbility themselves moulded, sometimes even enabled, the social and\\neconomic changes which took place. The particular characteristics\\nofthe period meantthatlocational mobility was a potentweapon in\\nthe hands ofmanagement. Inmanufacturing industry this was,\\noverall, a period ofjobloss, but it was a period ofpeculiarly \\'active\\'\\njobloss.Employment decline frequently took place in the contextof\\nmajorinvestment in newtechnology (Massey and Meegan, 1982).\\nSuch asituation provided ampleopportunities for dividing the\\nworkforce, thecombination oflocational flexibility with economic\\nslowdown being crucial. Thus\\'geography\\' played an active role in\\nthe frequent coincidence in the early partof the period between\\ntechnical change, or related means of increasing productivity, and\\nlocational shift.Locational changeandchanges inproduction\\nprocess were often partand parcel of each other. The category of\\n\\'intransit\\'lossesofemployment (Massey and Meegan, 1979) is\\nimportant here inhighlighting the fact thatthenumber ofjobs\\ngained at the \\'destination\\' end of such moves was often well below\\nthenumberofjobslost at the \\'origin\\'. Moreover, in many such\\ncases it was not justa net loss ofjobswhich was at issue but also a\\nchange in the natureofthe workforce. The very fact of distance and\\nofthepossibility oflocational changecouldoftenmakesuch\\n\\'restructuring\\' easier for management. Aboveall, itfrequently\\nconfused the issue. In this period new techniques , and changes in\\nlabourprocesses, were often introduced into the production of\\nexisting levels ofoutput,ratherthanbeingembodied inextra\\ncapacity. This had two effects. First, if the changes were introduced\\non site, in an existing factory,theinvestment itselfappeared to be\\nresponsible for the loss ofjobs.\\'Technology\\' became the enemy.\\nNewinvestment came to be feared as probably leading only to\\nreductions inemployment. Second, the new investment in the new\\ntechniques ofproduction might take place in anotherregion - in a\\nperipheral ornon-conurbation area,forinstance, whereas the\\nexistingcapacity was in the city. However, because this was taking\\nplacein aperiodofslowdown, because it wasnotpossible\\nsubstantially to increase output,the new investment in the new Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 235\\nprocesses had often to be compensated for byclosureof the existing\\nfactory. In this case, the issue again oftencame to be definedin\\ntermsofcompetition between different areas-thoseaboutto be\\nmaderedundant in theinnercities could only too easily interpret the\\nsituation as the regions ofnewinvestment \\'takingtheirjobs\\'. Had\\nthe newtechnique beenintroduced as anextension tocapacity it is\\nunlikely thatit would have been foughtby theunions.Indeed, it\\nwouldprobably have been welcomed as providing newemployment.\\nSuch asituation will typify periodsofgrowth.The real problem, of\\ncourse,wasneither\\'technology \\'northecompetitive demands of\\nworkers inotherareas,butthecontinued effortstoincrease\\nproductivity when the rate ofoutputgrowthwas slowing down.\\nInotherways, too, geography wascentralto theperiod.Regional\\nconsiderations andregional policy\\'wereimportant aspectsbothof\\ntheconstruction ofthepolitical allianceofthisperiodandof the\\nattempted solution to theeconomic andpolitical problems which\\npresented themselves. The end ofthe long boomhad seen the re\\xad\\nemergence of the regional problem as apolitical issue. The onset of\\neconomic problems washeralded by falls in employment in the\\nbasicindustries in the early 1960s. Indeed, the very returnofa\\nLabourGovernment in 1964, and the full establishment ofthe\\npolitical strategyofthisperiodhas to be seen in this context. In\\n1963, the Conservatives hadtakenfirefighting measures to quell\\npotentialdiscontent intheworst-hit regions (thenorth-east of\\nEngland, andScotland). It was the beginning of there-establish\\xad\\nment of regional policy. In 1964 the LabourPartywasreturned to\\npowerwith anelectoral baseprimarily inwhatwere to become the\\nDevelopment Areasandwithsignificant promises inboththe\\nManifesto andtheQueen\\'s Speech of a commitment toregional\\npolicy.\\nThestrength of theLabourPartyin these regions (see Chapter 5)\\nwas thus an important supportofthenational-level alliancewhile,\\nprecisely becauseone side of thatalliancehad astrongly-coherent\\nregional basis (at least in terms of labour-movement leadership),\\nregional policy was an important component ofholdingtogether\\nthenational politics.Bothsidesofthisequation were to be\\nparticularly important given the serious joblosses which subse\\xad\\nquentlyresultedfrom the rationalisation of someofthecore-sectors\\nin these regions, andinparticular ofcoal-mining .Therewas a real\\npotential conflict here.Ontheonehandtheelectoral and\\norganisational strength of thegovernment lay inperipheral regions 236SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nwhich were alreadysuffering above-average, and increasing, levels\\nofunemployment. There was real pressure, from regions such as the\\nnorth-east, for action. On the otherhandoneofthecentralaimsof\\nthe Wilson government in itsattempttomodernise theeconomy\\nwas torationalise the heavy basic sectors. As we have seen, this\\nprogramme resulted in massive losses ofjobs. Some 48000jobs\\nwere lost in the pits in Durham injustfour years between 1964and\\n1968. And these industries, andconsequently thejoblosses, were\\nconcentrated precisely in the regions ofLabour\\'s base and electoral\\nstrength. Regional policy, and the promise ofotherjobsto replace\\nthose fast disappearing, waspartofthe means ofacquiring the\\ncompliance oftradeunionleaders.Majorclosures in particular\\nareaswerefrequently compensated for by a grantofSpecial\\nDevelopment Areastatus. The existence ofalternative employment\\nhad always encouraged a high level ofvoluntary redundancy from\\nmining, which would clearly ease any rank-and-file objection to the\\nrationalisation .Inotherwords, at the startofthis period not only\\nwere there already calls for a regional policy, but a commitment to\\nsuch a policy was to be even more necessary if the cutbacks in the\\nbasic sectors were to be pushed through. Thesupportofthelabour\\nmovement - or at least its leaders - in those regions was therefore\\nimportant to economic policy-making at bothnational and regional\\nlevels,and in its turn,regional policy was important in gaining that\\nsupport.\\nThesignificance ofregional policy,however, even at the\\nbeginning ofthisperiod,also had anotheraspect. This concerned\\nthe reserves oflabourin the old heavy-industry peripheral regions.\\nThese reserves included notjusttheunemployed but also the\\nreservesoflabourimplied by the low activity rates in the regions\\n(seeChapter 5).Inthe 1950sone ofthe pressures towardsregional\\npolicy had been concern abouttheinflationary effectofgeogra\\xad\\nphically-differentiated pressure on the labourmarket(seeChap\\xad\\nter 4). By the next decade, however, the problem was initially\\nperceived as being one ofpotential \\'absolute\\' shortage: one of the\\nmainconstraints onnationaleconomic growthwas expected to be a\\nshortage oflabour. TheNational Plan of 1965 predicted anannual\\nrateofgrowthofoutputof4 per cent, and the chiefobstacleto the\\nachievement ofthis was thought to bepotential \\'bottlenecks\\', of\\nwhich one ofthe most important was expected to be thatoflabour.\\nA\\'manpower gap\\'of800000wascalculated , and regional policy,\\nbyevening-out unemployment and activity rates, was to provide Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 237\\nhalfofthatextralabour.At precisely thattime,ofcourse, the\\naccelerated decline of the heavy industries, itself aproduct of\\ngovernment policy, was substantially addingto these reserves of\\nlabour, both male (through unemployment) and female (through\\nfreeing women on to the labourmarket). Development Areas,\\nwhereregional policyincentives wereavailable , weredefined\\nbroadly, toencompass not only areas ofhighunemployment but\\nalsopotential foci for growth, andspatialreorganisation within\\nthem (see Chapter 5) made conditions ready. The quotations in\\nFigure6.1indicate theargument and also the importance of\\nregional policy in this respect. The earlier role ofhelping to damp\\ndowninflationary pressures was also mentioned , but now in a\\nsecondary position. Thesummary ofthe role ofregional policy\\nadded: \\'At the same time a more even spreadofemployment\\nthroughout thecountrywillhelp to avoid regional pocketsofexcess\\ndemandsetting the pace in driving up costs and prices while there\\nare still unused resources elsewhere\\' (p. II).\\nRegional policy, in otherwords, was to be used to create space\\nfor the projected growth. Looked at anotherway, what this meant\\nwasthatregional policy, by increasing the supply of labour, would\\nbe oneinstrument inbreaking the increased economic power which\\nworkers had gained duringthe expansive growthofthe previous\\nperiod. In relation to \\'theworking class\\' the policy was thus quite\\ncontradictory . It was bothapay-off to aparticular sectionofthat\\nclass (a section defined spatially - theparty\\'spolitical base in the\\nregions) and at the same time it was a way of undermining the\\neconomic strength oflabourmore generally, but a strength which,\\ngiven the geography of the previous decade\\'s economic growth, was\\nspearheaded by workers in the midlands andsouth-east.\\nNorwere the otherdeterminants ofregional policy simply a\\nquestion oftherequirements of\\'capital\\' as some undifferentiated\\nwhole, or ofsomeaggregated notionof\\'accumulation \\' atnational\\nlevel. Regional policy was, rather,a response to the requirements of\\nparticular partsofcapital.Notonly was big capitalexpanding\\nfaster than small up to and over this period,but it was also more\\nlikely to be able both to shift geographically - or to set up branches\\nin newlocations - and to use the kind of reserves oflabour\\navailable.i This was not, then, some kind of\\'trade-off\\' between\\npotential social and economic roles for regional policy, but a\\ncombination oftherequirements ofdifferent partsofthe social\\nstructure, the result ofthe historically-specific configuration ofthe 238SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThe reserve of labour in the less prosperous regions\\n7. Over the last 10 years an average of420,000 workers have been\\nunemployed in the United Kingdom atanyone time; and the incidence ofthis\\nunemployment variesconsiderably between regions. If the unemployment rate in\\nthe lessprosperous regions could be reduced to the average for GreatBritain\\nover the last 10years (which is also the actual rate in 1964)some 100,000 more\\npeople would be employed in those regions. The main increases would be in\\nScotland (37,000) and Northern Ireland (28,000), and the North-Western\\nRegion,Northern RegionandWaleswouldeach gain 12,000. (In this\\ncalculation the national average unemployment rate has been taken as a\\nconvenient measuring rod; but otherstandards could be used, such as the\\nlowest regional rate.) It would be imprudent to assume thatthe whole 100,000\\naddition toemployment could be achieved by 1970; but with effective policies to\\nincrease employment opportunities in the less prosperous regions, it should be\\npossible to reduce the numbers unemployed by some 50,000 duringthe plan\\nperiod.\\n8. There are also some (amongold people and marriedwomen, for example)\\nwho might be willing to enteror remain in the working population in certain\\ncircumstances. Activity rates ofoldermen (the proportion ofthe group which is\\nin theworking population) have been declining, particularly with the spread of\\nstate and privateoccupational pension schemes, and the forecasts in paragraph 2\\nassume a continuing though slower decline. If this were halted, and 1964activity\\nratesmaintained, there would beabout50,000 more men in the labourforce in\\n1970.The forecasts of working population alreadyinvolve a continuing increase\\nin activity rates of married women above the age of 35;but they still assume that\\nsome 3 million married women between 45 and 65 will not be in the labourforce\\nin 1970.\\n9. Activity rates in the countryas a whole are higher now than in 1943, at\\nthe height ofmobilisation of manpower resources in the Second World War.\\nThey are also higher than in the United States and amongthe highest in Western\\nEurope. But the differences between activity rates in the different regions give\\nsomeindication ofthe scope for drawing extrapeople into the working\\npopulation ifemployment opportunit ies were more equally distributed . Some\\nof the differences in regional activity ratesare due to variations in theproportion\\nofthepopulation in each region which can be regarded aspotentially\\neconomically active; and the calculations in Table 3.1 make an allowance (in\\nthe second column) for those who are retired, being educated or in institutions.\\nThe third column of the table then shows that if activity rates in the regions\\nwhere they are below average could be raised to the national average, the\\naddition to thelabourforce in GreatBritain would be around320,000.\\nPractically all of this increase would be made up ofwomen. In addition\\n40,000 extra people might be drawn into the working population inNorthern\\nIreland if activity rates there could be raised to the national average. It would\\nnot be practical however, to expect to bring the whole ofthis extra 360,000 into\\nthelabourforce by 1970. Itwould be a substantial achievement to gethalfway\\ntowards this goal. Class.

The rationale for regional policy has to be under\\xad\\nstoodas acombination ofresponses, to social and political\\npressures, and to economic requirements.\\nFurther, we have alreadyseen inChapter 5thatthe regional\\nbasesofthis alliance tookaparticular form. It was not justa\\nquestion ofcountry-wide alliances between social groups but ofa\\nwhole series ofstructures, often with fairly coherent regional-level\\nexistences. Chapter 5 referred to the construction of a politics of\\nconsensus incertainregions. These were \\'regional\\' structures in\\ntermsofboththeirsocial bases andtheiraims.Theywere\\nconstructed toaddress regional problems, but they were also\\nfundamental tonational-level strategy. It was through themthat\\nacquiescence was won for the modernising strategyat regional level;\\nfor thespatial, social and economic restructuring ofthese areas. All\\nofthis was crucial to the national strategy.\\nFairlyquickly, however, the \\'economic\\' aspectsofthe role of\\nregional policy underwent a shift. While much ofthe original\\nargument for regional policy (in the first halfofthe 1960s) was\\ncouched in terms of expanding the supply of labour,by 1966\\nunemployment over the country as a whole was startingto rise\\nsteeply. While, given the continuing political commitment to\\ninternational competition in open world markets, it wascertainly\\nnecessary for industry to cut costs, and true thatthis could be aided\\nbybothmoving in search ofcheaper labourandexpanding the\\noverall supply, there was no immediate prospect ofsome kind of\\n\\'absolute\\' shortage oflabour.Insteadofoutputmarching aheadby\\n4 per cent a year, its rate ofgrowthfell off. The problem for the\\npotentially expanding sectionsofcapitalbecame one ofretaining \\xad\\nand if possible increasing -competitiveness ratherthanone of\\nfinding sufficient elbow-room to grow. In this contextregional\\npolicy played a role in whatcame to be called \\'restructuring\\'. For\\nindividual firms,investment grants(asopposed to the previous\\nsystem of depreciation allowances) were especially useful in the\\ncontextofliquidity problems and relatively low profits. In that\\ncontext,regional policy and the changes in industry weremutually\\nreinforcing . On the one handchanges in production couldbe a\\nprecondition foradvantage to betakenof regional policy; on the\\notherhandthegrantsavailable through regional policy could\\nencourage orevenenablethosechanges bysubsidising the\\ninvestment in the new processes ofproduction . But not only did\\ntheeconomic roleofregional policy change over time, its impact Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 241\\nalso varied between sectors.Mostobviously, it was simply more\\nimportant in some sectors than othersas afactorinlocational\\nchange. But more thanthis, regional policy combined indifferent\\nways indifferent industries withotherdevelopments takingplace at\\nthe time. The wayitactually operated was also different. Notall\\nindustries were \\'restructuring\\' in the same manner. Inclothing, for\\ninstance, there was no majorreorganisation ofproduction processes\\nwhichenabled decentralisation. Here it was more a question of\\ncompetition forlabour(Chapter 4). Inothersectorssimilar\\ndecentralisation tookplacewithout regional policyplayingany\\nrole. This was the case in services (although SET may have had a\\ndifferential effect). In the service industries as a whole, while overall\\ngrowthwas relatively low, there was still some growthand it was\\nprecisely in those parts(except for local authority services) which\\nare lesslocationally tied to local population (i.e.producer services,\\ncentralState,etc.). It was duringthisperiodthatthespatial\\nseparation anddecentralisation of clerical work began, much ofit\\nat this time going to Wales. So each ofthe three majorsectors\\nexamined in Chapter4, allofwhichdecentralised jobs- and similar\\njobs- over the period,did so with very different relationships to\\nregional policy.\\nIt has been arguedelsewhere (Massey, 1979) that\\'theeffectsof\\nregional policy\\'cannotbetreatedas amattersimplyofthe\\ngeographical distributionofnumbers ofjobs.Thisanalysisofthe\\nlate sixties andearlyseventies showsjusthowcomplex and\\nchanging its role, and consequently its effects, can be.

In some individual casesthatundoubtedly was the\\nsituation,butoverall the role and place ofregional policy was far\\nmore complex. Regional policy was an integral, ifchanging, partof\\nboththe economics and the politics oftheperiod.\\nTable 6.1 pulls out some ofthe more specific characteristics of\\nemployment changeduringthis period. While none ofthe general\\ntrendsis new, or confined to thisperiod,it is also clear thatthere\\nwas at this time a particular condensation ofmanyof thedifferent\\nelements in the overall, much longer-term shift between nationally\\xad\\ndominant spatialdivisions of labour.Otherchangesreinforced this\\nshift.

This was the late sixties, and the more general\\nrevival of socialist political culture,and of radical movements based\\naroundgroupsotherthantradeunions, saw little attraction in the\\nLabourParty.\\nTherewere also othermorematerial reasons for disenchantment\\namongthose whose jobswere affected by the policies. Unemploy\\xad\\nmentcontinued to grow apace, incomes policies were imposed and\\nthere were attacksonpreviously-established unionrights.Techno\\xad\\nlogical change in industry, beingintroduced so late, when economic\\ngrowthhadalreadybegun to slow down, provoked fierceopposi\\xad\\ntion, as did - more obviously -closureandrationalisation .Arnold\\nWeinstock became a bitenoireofthelabourmovement\\' Regional\\npolicy had contributed to themovement ofjobstoDevelopment\\nAreas, and those regions\\'relativeunemployment rates were indeed\\nfalling, but absolute rates (which are, perhaps, whatmattersmore)\\ncontinued to rise.Moreover , the fact thatsuch a high proportion of\\ntheincoming jobswere for women, ofwhom in turna high\\nproportion had previously not been \\'economically active\\',meant\\nthattheunemployment was not reduced by an equivalent amount.\\nThis, and the fact thatthejobswere often lower-paid and less\\ndemanding ofindustrial skills,meantthattheyprovided little direct\\nrelief for redundant miners and steel -workers (seeChapter 5) \\xad\\nthose, in otherwords, for whom regional policy had apparently\\nbeenpartofthebargain.Thelabour-movement sideofthe alliance,\\nundersuch acombination ofcircumstances ,couldhardlybe\\nexpected to hold up. In 1969 Wilson\\'s reception at theTUC\\nconference was frosty; in 1970 the LabourPartylost the election\\nto agovernment with no basis at all for such an alliance (and\\nindeed which went to the countryin 1974with a challenge - which\\nfailed -againstthe regional \\'core-sector\\').\\nMoreover, manufacturing industry also refused to react in the\\npolitically-desired manner.Notso much antagonism asinertia\\ncharacterised its response. The more dynamic sectorscontinued\\nthepredilection for investing abroad, and indeed many ofthe\\npoliciesofthe period reinforced this or ientation . TheIRC,by\\nencouraging sizeandinternational competitiveness, produced\\ncontradictory results, as international competitiveness , for the Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 245\\ncompanies, meantnot so much exporting asinvesting abroad\\n(Singh, 1975; Massey and Meegan, 1979). The conflict between\\nthetraditional world role and the modernisation oftheeconomy\\nhadnotbeengrappled with,andthe net resultin so far as\\nmanufacturing industry wasconcerned was toreinforce it, by\\nstrengthening thosesections whoseinfluence on policy putin\\nsecond place the healthofthe UKinternaleconomy .Later,EEC\\nentrydid much the same (Gray,1982).\\nTherewas,moreover, morestraightforward opposition from\\notherpartsofcapital.Banking capital, the fraction more used to\\nholdingpower, had throughout been more ambiguous in itsrelation\\nto thestrategy(Jessop, 1979,p. 102),and its opposition waspartof\\ntheeventual undermining ofthe policy. By 1967, with devaluation,\\nthecontradictions shouldhave been obvious. But\\'thefatal\\npersistence in the belief thatno choice was necessary gravely\\nundermined themodernisation strategy of the 1960s and wrecked\\nmanyofthe reforms which it launched\\' (Gamble, 1981, p. 102).\\nWith such uncertain adherents thestrategycouldnot survive the\\nworsening economic situation . While some restructuring had been\\nachieved, the economy continued to decline. The political stale\\xad\\nmate had not been broken.\\nMuddling through\\nThe rest ofthe 1970s was a period of greatervariability, in terms\\nbothofeconomic strategyandofthe social basis on which it was\\nbuilt. The periodbegan with the inheritance ofthe Wilson and\\nHeathgovernments .Therewas, in the early years, a high level of\\ngrass-roots unionmilitancy and aunionleadership which, until\\n1975,inclined towardsthe left. While much ofthis renewed activity\\nremained still within the old defensive, sectionalist terms(Hodgson,\\n1981),therewere also morepositive experiments, particularly\\nduring1974,with TonyBenn at the Ministry ofIndustry. Labour\\'s\\nProgramme 1973, with its emphasis onmultinational capital(the\\nmeso-economic sector) and the problems oftrade,represented the\\nbeginnings ofarecognition ofthepersistent conflict between\\ninternal economy andinternational role(Gamble, 1981).There\\nwas also increasing recognition ofthe need to shift the locus of\\npowerwithinindustry through anextension ofindustrial demo\\xad\\ncracy. 246 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nNoneoftheseinitiatives, however, was tolastorbearfruit.The\\neconomic strategy of1973 was transformed beyond recognition\\nfromanassault oninternational capital topowerless \\'Sector\\nWorking Parties\\', one\\'Planning Agreement\\' ,andagradual slide\\nintomonetarism .Someofthelonger-term themeswerecontinued :\\nmodernisation(though nowmoremuted), continual financial\\npressure (epitomised by theIMFdrama)andtheattempts togain\\nagreement fromtheunionstopolicieswhichinevitably, intheshort\\ntermatleast,meanthigherunemployment andlowerwages. Butthe\\noverallpolitical climatewasdifferent fromthatofthe sixties.\\nThisdifference wasreinforced by,andinteracted with,other\\ncontrasts .Mostimportantly, thewidereconomic situation wasnow\\nspectacularly different.

Byearly1977, at least20percentof\\nexisting productive capacity in theGECDas awholewasstanding\\nidle(Coates, 1980, p. 36). All this, combined with the moremuted\\nmodernisation policy,showedup in the fall-offin investment andin\\ntherateofgrowthofproductivity after1973(Singh, 1977).Italso\\nhadawidereffect on policy.TheLabourgovernment, adopting an\\nemphasis onholdingbackinflation, was by 1975 -6beginning tocut\\nbackon thegrowthofpublicexpenditure (andwhatthismeantwas\\nexpenditure onwelfareandrelatedservices-Stateaid toindustry\\nincreased) .\\nThisperiodwasalsodifferent fromthesixtiesinthatthe\\nemphasis wasnowlessexclusively on big, manufacturing capital\\n(inspiteoftheclearanalysis in Labour\\'s Programme 1973).The\\nNational Enterprise Board,whichtheparty\\'sProgramme wishedto\\nseeestablish somedegreeofpublicownership inthelargest\\ncompanies ,instead (withashoestring budgetandpolitics the\\nopposite ofradicalinterventionism), concentrated itsmainefforts\\nonsmallandmedium-sized businesses (Coates, 1980, p. 116).

These were by no means\\nall, or specifically, directed at small capital,butmanysuchsectors\\nwere involved, including wool textiles (on which the IRChad\\nrefused to act), clothing, ferrous and non-ferrous foundries and\\nmachine tools. In clothing, forinstance, a special Clothing Industry\\nProductivity Resources Agency was established ,andfirms in the\\nindustry were eligible, as partoftheIndustrial Strategy, for the\\nspecial scheme ofassistance underSection 8 oftheIndustry Act.\\nSimilarly, the qualifying sizeofnewinvestment for theAccelerated\\nProjects Scheme and its successor, Selective Investment Scheme,\\nwere set relatively low. Innercity policies, too, tendedto lay\\nconsiderable emphasis on small firms and the end oftheperiod\\nsaw the heady but relatively short-lived enthusiasm for the United\\nStatesfindingsofBirch(asserting theimportance ofemployment\\ngrowthin small firms), while there was a general shift in all areasof\\nsubnational economic policytowards \\'indigenous growth\\', an\\nemphasis which had muchthesameimplications .Thisshift\\ntowards smallerfirms had a number of bases.

Certainly, as we shall see, it wasto\\nhavespatialimplications.\\nTherewere two otherways,alreadyimpliedbutworthnoting\\nexplicitly, in which this perioddiffered from the sixties.

It was a less\\n\\'active\\'periodofdecline. Certainly it seems possible thatthe\\npotential fordecentralising evenassembly workwasreduced. At\\nthesametime,however, thefasterdeclineinemployment in\\nmanufacturing as awhole,themajorlosses in consumer goods,\\nandinparticular inthoseconsumer-goods sectorsdominated by\\nsmallcapital, left the urbanareasandolderindustrial regions\\nparticularly vulnerable.

Producer servicescontinued to grow thoughat a slightly\\nlower rate, and they were proportionally lessimportant. The office\\nandcomputer boom was less evident. The balanceinconsumer\\nservices shifteddramatically frompublictoprivate, which in\\ngeneral would indicate aworsening oftheir regional distribution\\n(seeChapter4), butpublic-sector servicesnevertheless continued to\\ngrow and thus to retainsome significance as a countervailing force\\nin terms ofthe regional distribution ofdifferent typesofemploy\\xad\\nment.Puttingall thistogether, andremembering itsemphasis on\\nmanufacturing, it is evident thatregional policy had less roomfor\\nmanoeuvre thanduringtheprevious decade.\\n* * *This was reinforced bychanges in thestatusofthe policy itself.\\nIndeed, once again, geographical unevenness and spatialpolicy were\\nintegralto the whole story. Between 1972 and 1979 spatialpolicy\\nbothchanged in form and as a whole became less important in\\nrelationtonational economic policy. In terms of regional policy,\\nthissubordination began with the increased sectoralemphasis of the\\nConservatives\\' Industry andFinanceActs and was continued under\\ntheLabourGovernment\\'s Industrial Strategy (Johnstone, 1979). In\\nthelatterthedecreasing importance ofregional policy can be\\ndetected in thedeclining proportion ofStatefinancial aid to\\nindustry beingawarded on regional grounds, in therelaxation of\\nIDes,the ending of REP, and in the actualspatialbalanceofsome\\nof themajorsectoral policies, which favoured non-Development\\nAreas(Cameron, 1979). This has often been interpreted as regional\\npolicy\\'s being a primarily social and redistributive policy, and being\\ntraded-off againstnational economic imperatives .Thereis an\\nelement of truthin this, but there were also otherthreadsto the\\nstory. We have alreadyarguedthatregional policy itself had not up\\nto thispointanyway been playinga solely\\'welfare\\' role. In fact two\\nthings seem to have been going on. First,theconditions within\\nwhich regional policy had been playingits\\'economic\\' role in aiding\\naccumulation inpartsofindustry, forinstancewithinrestructuring,\\nwere themselves receding. Manufacturing employment was declin\\xad\\ning at an increased rate, but further,thatdecline was combined with\\nlow rates of investment and a fall-off, as we have seen, in the rate of\\ngrowthofproductivity .\\'Potentially-mobile-manufacturing employ\\xad\\nment\\'is thus likely to have fallen even more thanthe simple\\nemployment numbers would suggest, for less oftheemployment\\ndecline seems to have been takingplace in the contextofinvestment 250SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nin new techniques (Massey andMeegan, 1982).Undersuch\\ncircumstances regional policy would be less use to capital, either\\nas simple aid or, perhaps moreparticularly, because the newly\\xad\\navailable workforces oftheDevelopment Areaswould no longerbe\\nrelevant. Thesenewworkforces were on the whole moreuseful to\\nbigthanlittlecapital.But as we have seen, national industrial policy\\nwas now extended tosignificant sectionsofsmallcapital,andthese\\nschemes were takenup bysectorsbothwithinandoutsideassisted\\nareas.However for small capital,regional policy was unlikely to\\nplay much of a role in any process of restructuring .Take, for\\ninstance, thefoundryandmachine toolindustries, forbothofwhich\\nsectoral schemes operated . Both are located primarily outside\\nDevelopment Areas,botharedominated by small companies and\\nbothareprimarily male-employing .Forprecisely these reasonsthe\\nincentives ofregional policy would be largely irrelevant. Such small\\nfirms are less locationally mobile,andwould be more likely to\\npreferinvestment in situ.Moreover inmostcases in these industries\\nnewinvestment , even in more modern techniques, rarely led to\\nincreased employment ofwomen, andtherefore the reserves of\\nfemalelabourin theDevelopment Areas were oflittlepotential\\nuse.(Andtheattractions ofamaleworkforce recently made\\nredundant from the NCBor BSC are likely to have been minimal\\nto the\\'smallbusinessman\\' ofthe west midlands .) In this contextthe\\neasingofIDCcontrols musthave been particularly welcome \\xad\\nindeeditseems to have reflected boththisprocessandthereduced\\npressure onlabourmarkets in thecentralareas. Aswouldbe\\nexpected given these arguments, regional policybecameover the\\n1970s less effective in terms ofjobcreation in theDevelopment\\nAreas(Moore, et al.,1977; Massey andMeegan, 1982).\\nWhatwashappening over this period,then,wascertainly that\\nregional policy was increasingly subordinate tonational industrial\\npolicy,butalsothattheregionalpolicy itself was in partareflection\\nof(orwenthandinhandwith) its own declining role as an armof\\nnational industrial policy.Therewere also, ofcourse,political\\nconditions whichenabled, orencouraged, a decline in emphasis on\\nregional policy as a purelyredistributive mechanism . Inparticular,\\nunemployment in non-Development Areaswas rising. They had no\\njobs\\'tospare\\'. In theinnercities,equivalent problems ofpoverty\\nandunemployment werebeginning to take on seriouspolitical\\nproportions .Undersuchcircumstances, it was not inconvenient to\\nletregional policy be blamedfor decline elsewhere anddifficult to Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 251\\ncontinue it as such a majorelement ofStatepolicytowards\\nindustry.\\nIncontrast to themodernisation period,therefore, whenregional\\npolicy had had an impactpartlybecauseofthestrength ofits\\noperation andpartlybecause theconditions existed in which it\\ncouldsucceed, in this laterperioditbothhad less roomfor\\nmanoeuvre economically and was subordinated politically.\\nTheincreasing geographical spreadofhigh levels ofunemploy\\xad\\nmentexacerbated the specifically spatialcompetition forjobs,and\\nworkers indifferent partsofthecountry, defining themselves as\\nworkers fromparticular regions, werethrownintoconflictfor the\\nfew newjobsthatwerearound.This was sharpened by the fact that\\nmuchoftherhetoricofStatepolicy was gearedto aninterpretation\\nofregional or localunemployment as a result ofthe failings ofthe\\nparticular areasinquestion (a lack of skills, a lack ofentrepreneur\\xad\\nship, too much \\'bureaucracy\\' on thepartoflocalplanners, too\\nmuchmilitancy on thepartoflocalworkers). Andinmanycases,\\nbecauseoftheimmediacy ofthe local problems, the issue was taken\\non in those terms. Forspatially separate interests are real; the high\\nnational levelofunemployment was unevenly distributed between\\nareas.\"Regions are thus set in competition with each other.The\\nexample ofInmosinFigure6.2, for whichnearly100 local\\nauthoritie scompeted , wasjustoneofmanyduringthisperiod.\\nMerseyside workers demanded work for Merseyside ,innercity\\ngroupscomplained thatregional policy was responsible fortheir\\nlossofjobsand there were rival claims to have the highestlocalrate\\nofunemployment. Notonly did this divide peoplein one region\\nfromthoseinanother, anddivertattention from the overall\\nproblem ofunemployment , it also prepared thegroundfor local\\nattacksontradeunions.Itwas theworkersofMerseyside who drew\\nmostattention on this score, the decline oftheareabeingfrequently\\nblamedontheirlackof\\'discipline \\'.

It was the\\nconurbations - Merseyside, Clydeside and Newcastle - which led\\ntheareas\\'accelerated jobloss. It was what Townsend (1982)aptly\\ncalls the intersection ofregional and urbanproblems, thatisofthe\\n\\'traditional\\' regional problem and the now accelerated decline of\\noldermanufacturing more generally - the intersection, inother\\nwords,oftheimpactof two shifts in the international division of\\nlabour.\\nThepatternofgeographical differentiation injobtypeand\\noccupational structure continued to bereproduced ,thoughagain\\nwithdifferences from the earlierperiod.Overall, thespatial\\ncentralisation ofcontrol, andtheestablishment andspatial\\nconcentration ofmanagerial hierarchies in thesouth-east, contin\\xad\\nued,thoughat a slower rate. \\'General management \\'remained over\\xad\\nrepresented inGreater London and the rest ofthesouth-east\\n(ROSE) throughout theperiod, and indeed increased its over\\xad\\nrepresentation (Kirwan, 1981). Exactly the reverse was true for\\nthenorth, and Wales and Scotland, whereunder-representation was\\nreinforced .Moreover , \\'assistant management\\' (which includes the\\nwholegamutofprofessional support) showed exactly the same\\npattern.\"\\nBut if the picturewas clear for management, thatfor profes\\xad\\nsionals in science, technology andengineering was much more\\nmixed. This could reflect the decline in importance ofproducer\\nservices, bothas aproportion ofemployment changeand in their\\nown rate of growth(though thecategory also includes the more\\nproduction-based engineering technologists - seeChapter 4). It\\nwould be interesting toexploretheseconnections further.Certainly\\none can detectthedeclining emphasis onmodernisation and\\ntechnical change.\\nAt theotherend of the occupational structure, too, thecharacter\\nof the period left its imprint.Although therecontinued tobea shift\\nwithin women\\'s employment towardsassembly work, there was an 254SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nabsolute overalI decline in numbers, reflecting the declines in new\\nmeans-of-production industries andinconsumer goods.In alI\\nregions this kind of employment for women felIinimportance ,\\nand the biggest losers included theDevelopment Areasofthesouth\\xad\\nwest, the northandWales. The northactualIy moved into deficit\\nover the period(NewEarnings Survey). In otherwords, while,\\nexcept for the north,all theDevelopment Areasremained \\'over\\xad\\nrepresented\\', the(net)processofmovement ofthesejobsto\\nperipheral regionsdid notcontinue in anyconsistent mannerover\\nthisperiod.\"\\nBut while there was hesitation in thedecentralisation ofassembly\\njobsfor women, the decentralisation ofclericaljobs - as would be\\nimplied by the aggregate economic changes-continued throughout\\ntheperiod.GreaterLondon, ROSEandEastAngliaalldecreased\\ntheirrepresentation. Incontrast, thenorthofEngland, thesouth\\xad\\nwest,Scotland andWales all increased their relative proportions of\\nthesejobs- in the cases ofthe first three, very significantly (Kirwan,\\n1981).9\\nAll these shifts in balancecan thus be understood inrelationto\\nthenational changes discussed earlier.Manyofthetrendsofthe\\nprevious periodcontinued .Management continued its process of\\nspatialcentralisation , clerical work continued todecentralise . But\\nthe speed andbalanceofthedifferent components changed.There\\nwas a less spectacular rateofconcentration ofmaleprofessional\\nworkers in thesouth-east ofEngland, thebalanceofwomen\\'s jobs\\ndecentralising (relatively) to the peripheral regionsshiftedmore\\ntowardsclerical work. The basic sectorscontinued to decline, butat\\na slower rate. Overall, the shift between spatialdivisions oflabour\\nat thebroadnational levelcontinued but,reflecting economic and\\npolitical changes, it did so more haltingly andin adifferent form.\\n***\\nTheCallaghan government was slowly shipwrecked on thecontra\\xad\\ndictions of its own, andWilsonian, politics.

While\\nthere were pressures - in the national economy andin the cities \\xad\\nfor areduced emphasis onregional policy, there was a growing\\nregional problem. Inthiscontext, stimulus forindigenous employ\\xad\\nment,however unlikely to succeed, was one ofthe few options\\navailable .Itwas also encouraged by achange,alreadymentioned,\\nin thenatureofregional politics themselves. Inthecontextofclaims\\nfordevolution inScotland and Wales the high degree ofexternal\\nownership, inpartitselfa result ofregional policy,becamean\\nincreasingly important component ofthepoliticsofregionalism\\n(see, for an earlyexample, Firn,1973).The Communist Partyin the\\nnorth-west (Communist Party,undated), theLabour Partyin\\nScotland (Labour Party, 1977), the Welsh and Scottish Nationalist\\nParties,andotherorganisations in \\'the regions\\' raised this as a\\nmajorissueofcomplaint. Inthecontextofthese shifts the Welsh\\nandScottish Development Agencies were established . They were\\nthus both political andeconomic responses, andtheirbrieffocused,\\nmorethanhadtheprevious formofregional policy, on the\\ngeneration ofinternal growth. The lack ofa basis for such a\\nstrategy wasapparent, however,andin fact all the regional IDAs\\nspentmoretimecontinuing the policy oftryingtoattractnew\\ninvestment, frequently inacrimonious competition with each other,\\nthanon\\'stimulating theexisting localeconomy\\'. Symbolically\\nperhaps, thegovernment finally went downon thedevolution issue.\\nMonetarism\\nTheelectionof1979markedabreakfrom the ever-shifting termsof\\nthepost-war consensus .Manyoftheactualeconomic policiesofthe\\nnewThatcher government - theso-called newmonetarism - were in\\nfact not new. A concernaboutthepublic-sector borrowing require\\xad\\nment, the political formulation oftheeconomic situation as being 256SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nprimarily aproblemofinflation, and cuts in public expenditure all\\nhad their precursors underthe previous Labourgovernment.\\nBut in political terms the victory oftheConservatives in 1979did\\nmark a shift. The adventofMargaret Thatcher as Prime Minister\\nheralded adeparture ,particularly inrhetorical and ideological\\nterms, from the post-war social-democratic tradition so manifestly\\nindisarray. The failure ofthe policies ofprevious decades laid the\\nbasis for the victoryoftheright.Realdisenchantment with\\nundemocratic Stateintervention, brilliantly orchestrated in apopu\\xad\\nlist\\'individual freedom\\' campaign, agreement between Conserva\\xad\\ntives and the Labourrightthatpublicexpenditure was\\'toohigh\\'\\n(butwherethatexpenditure wasinextricably associated with the\\npoliciesofLabour) and years ofattempts to stem the growthof\\nwages(butapparently to no avail in terms of economic recovery)\\ntogether produced an election victory for a Conservative Party\\nnewly-dominated by its right wing. Itwas a right wing prepared to\\nbreak the old consensus, to break through the shifting stalemate\\nthatwent with it. Itwas thus a very different tradition within the\\nToryparty.Ithad more commitment tomarketideology - at home\\nnow, as wellas in international trade- than to the settled old terms\\nofclass rule. It could not have been furtherfrom the Conservative\\nPartywhich,nearlytwentyyearsbefore, hadestablished the\\nNational Economic Development Office. But to pursue this new\\nphilosophy meantsocialreconstruction , and for real, not justas\\npartoftherhetoric of the new vision. Whatwas now popularly\\nparaded as themonolith ofthetradeunionmovement had to be\\nshakenup and weakened. While it might not providemuch in the\\nway of its own visions of an alternative future it was still strong\\nenoughin defence to preventa way out of the crisis being found on\\notherterms. But such a course meantalso the reconstruction of\\nmanyotheraspectsofBritish social life, including theentrenched\\nandarchaicinstitutions oftheestablishment, peopled in large part\\nbymembers ofthe\\'old\\'Tory party.\\nIn many ways the terms ofdebateofthe \\'modernisation\\' period\\nofthe sixties were now reversed. This was not justin the most\\nobvious senses, from Welfare State and public sector to cutback\\nandprivatisation. TheattackonStateexpenditure and on public\\nintervention waspartlyenabled byre-working the distinction\\nbetween \\'productive\\' and \\'non-productive \\'partsoftheeconomy .\\nIn the sixties the productive sector was pre-eminently manufactur\\xad\\ning; services were relegated to second place and politicians in both Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 257\\nmajorparties, as well as managers inmajor(manufacturing)\\ncompanies, attacked the\\'speculators\\' oftheproperty boom as\\nparasitic andunproductive . A decade laterthedistinction had come\\nto meansomething completely different: it was the market(private)\\nsector which was productive, the public which was the parasitic\\ndead-weight. Both distinctions, in verydifferent ways, had clear\\ngeographical repercussions. Therewereothersuchcontrasts, too.\\nInsteadofArnoldWeinstock, efficientmanager ofbigcapital,the\\nlikes of Freddie Laker-paraded in the image offree-booting\\nentrepreneur - were held up for public approbation , the kind of\\nattitudethatwas needed if the British economy was to be rescued.\\nAlong with this went a parallel shift in relationtoprofessionals,\\nscientists and technologists . Clearly those in the Statesector no\\nlonger held the key to recovery. But it was more thanthat;the idea\\noftechnological advance through the research laboratories ofbig\\ncapital was superseded by thenotionofthe scientist as entrepre\\xad\\nneur. The periodsofmodernisation andofmonetarism were not\\njustdifferent because the wider economic situation hadchanged so\\ndramatically, because \\'therequirements ofaccumulation\\' were\\ndifferent; they were also dramatically contrasting in thedominant\\npolitical interpretations ofwhat those requirements were.\\nButThatcherism did not sweep the board.Itwas, again, an\\nelection victory with a definable social base and a clear geographi\\xad\\ncaldimension . Its core was in the growing white-collar and middle\\nstrataalongside, within capitalitself, those elements which identi\\xad\\nfied ideologically with an \\'entrepreneurial\\' label. The contrast with\\nthe sixties is again clear. Thus, in terms ofthe \\'sci-tech\\' brigade:\\n\\'TheWilsonian seizureofscience as the theme for the 1964election\\n. . .soughtto define and capturea newstratum-thatofscientists\\nandtechnologists - and to insist thattheir interests lay with Labour\\n... .

Almostcertainly, a high proportion ofthe\\nsamegroupvoted for Thatcher in 1979\\'(Rose and Rose, 1982).The\\nwhite-collar stratawere not to be disappointed, eitherideologically\\noreconomically (indistributional terms),but small business,\\nalthough approving ideologically, was soon to suffer ratherthan\\ngain in purely economic terms. Support from big manufacturing\\nindustry was always more reserved, and occasionally oscillated\\nquitedramatically, but a call early on by the head ofthe CBI for a\\n\\'bare-knuckle fight\\' was resisted. Party-political loyalties were hard\\nto break. In spite ofits patience being sorely tested, the CBI at its 258SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconference in 1982 foundithardto forget its long-term party\\nallegiance. Afternumerous boardroom battles, reported in the\\nPress,overpossible transfer ofsupport tothenewSocial\\nDemocrats, mostcompanies retained theirlonger-term political\\nand class loyalties abovemoreimmediate economic interests. And\\nthroughout, theInstitute ofDirectors gave the new strategy total\\nsupport.

Thetraditional Labourbase\\nseems to have held in the former. \\'The British working class\\nsometimes continue[sl to vote Labour afterthemostappalling\\nclobbering - as they did in 1950, andas they did to a greatextentin\\ntheNorthandScotland this time\\' (Price, 1979, p. 706).

Astudyof\\nthe election commented thatthe evidence for whatit called \\'class\\nde-alignment\\' wasmadeall the more remarkable by thesimulta\\xad\\nneousstrengthening of regional alignment (Penniman, 1981).\\nTheimplications ofall this are interesting. Itreinforces the\\nindications inChapters 4and5thatthere are increasing geogra\\xad\\nphical divisions within each ofthesebroadsocialgroups. The\\ndifferences within the managerial andscientific-technical groupsare\\nparticularly interesting. FromChapters 4and5 it is clear that\\nwithin these broadgroupssocialstatusandgeographical location\\nare related and,whatis more, thatthey may also be mutually\\xad\\nreinforcing . In 1979 the autonomous influence oftheregionally\\xad\\nbasedLabour alliances andstrength, discussed inChapter 5,\\ncontinued to hold up. In otherwords,thewithin-class biases\\ntowards Labour in these areas, not only among\\'lower middle\\nandworking\\'butalsoamong\\'middle\\' classes have been retained, if\\nnotreinforced, given the knownchanges goingon insocial\\nstructure. IIHere we see again,then, a\\'reverseeffect\\',ofregional\\nindividuality onnational political structures, ofthepossible\\nimportance of\\'spatial\\' characteristics in theformation of social\\ncharacteristics.\\n* * *In the first year afterthe election the geographical basis of the\\nGovernment wasmirrored in thecutbacks made in regional policy.\\nTherewere anumberofcontributory reasonsbehindthese cuts.\\nFirst,theinternational economic situation, combined with the\\neffectsoftheGovernment\\'s owneconomic strategy, sentmanufac\\xad\\nturingemployment into anunprecedented decline.That,together 260SpatialDivisions of\\'Labour\\nwith lower investment in newbuilding, left little opportunity for any\\nspatialredistribution .Second, thisGovernment had no political\\nalliancewith the unionsandnopolitical base inmostoftheregions\\nwhichstoodto gain from the existingpatternofregional incentives.\\nTherewastherefore nomajorpolitical pressure forregional policy.\\nThird,theGovernment wasproclaiming anideological commitment\\ntothemarket andtocutsinpublicexpenditure .Economic\\nconditions ,political baseandideological predisposition thusall\\nindicated at leastsome cuts inregional policy,andtheseindeedtook\\nplace.Thecutsthemselves, moreover ,indicated somechangein the\\nnatureandpotential roleofregional policy.Theydidnotsimply\\nmakeit evenmoreofameanstounderpin accumulation .The\\ncutbacks in theautomatic Regional Development Grantsprovoked\\noutright attackfrom the CBI which,although agreeing itwouldnot\\npushforlaboursubsidies orIDCs,declared thatit did\\'favour\\nregional assistance beingconcentrated oninvestment incentives\\' and\\nsupported factorybuilding andinfrastructure provision ,andcon\\xad\\nfirmedits\\'strongsupport for thecurrent Regional Development\\nGrantsystemas amechanism forassisting investment\\' (CBI, 1979).\\nOverall, itdeclared \\'theCBl\\'scontinued support for astrong\\nregional policybasedon positive incentives\\' (CBI,1979).Thedetail\\nofthis isinteresting.

How does\\nthis new conceptof\"freetrading\" tie up with Sir Keith Joseph\\'s\\nthinking?\\' If the Wilson government\\'s regional policy was partand\\nparcelofitsstrategyfornational economic growth,this exercise in\\nenterprise zoneswasintegral to theThatcher government\\'s\\nproclamation ofa new politics. Indeed, it may well turnout to be\\ntheirmajorimpact(Anderson, 1983;LabourParty,1980; Massey,\\n1982). Even the changed conception of scientists and technologists\\nwas reflected in employment policy. \\'Science parks\\'sprangup in the\\nhopethatthe geniuses ofthe local academic institutions mightturn\\ntheirtalentsin anentrepreneurial direction, make money outof\\ntheirPhDs,and the link between academic science and the pursuit\\nofprofitbestrengthened. Finally, one arm ofregional policy was\\nabandoned entirely. This government, whose avowed aim ofsocial\\nreconstruction included, indeed necessitated, themodernisation of\\nmanyinstitutions of\\'theBritishestablishment\\', gave way before the\\nsocial power ofhigher-level civil servants and agreed to abandon\\nplans to decentralise to\\'theregions\\' offices ofthecentralState.\\nRegional, and more generally spatial,aspects of policy continued\\ntheirdownward slide inimportance while at the same time their\\nnatureand role shifted yet again.\\nMoreover, thiscutbackin regional policy came at a time when\\notherelements in the national strategy werehittingthe declining\\nperipheral regionsparticularly hard. Thecutbacks in thenationa\\xad\\nlisedindustries, especially steel and coal, had a regionalised impact,\\nas did public expenditure cuts. Local authority employment was\\noneofthe fewpartsof thejob-structure notoperating, in income\\nandskillterms,dramatically against theperipheral regions\\n(Chapter 4).Cutbacks weretherefore inthatsenseboundto have\\nthe effect of increasing regionalinequality. Thesituation was worse\\nthanthis,however, for in spite ofthe losses ofjobsin the\\nnationalised industries, regions such as Wales, the north-east and\\nScotland remained the most dependent in thecountry onState\\nactivityofsome sort, whether inexpenditure percapita(where\\nNorthern Irelandand then Wales toppedthe list), or in terms of\\njobs. On the latter,thedependence ofpeople in these regions on the\\npublicsectorfor relatively wellpaid white-collar jobsincreased over\\nthe 1970s, and this was especially true for women (Kirwan, 1981).\\nIn these regions virtually the only source ofhigher-paid and/or\\nprofessional employment which is available to women is the public Class.

Rumours of\\'socialunrest\\'andthreatsofactionseem\\nto have slowed for a while the eventualIy dramatic cutsatLlanwern\\nandPortTalbot; and it was the lead by the Welsh miners which\\nforced the government to back offin early 1981on itsfinancial\\nstringency with the NCB. Later, there was political reluctance to\\nclose the Ravenscraig steelworks inScotland ,partofBSe\\'splanned\\ncutback. But overall the attempt to cut back on welfare provision\\nand the public sectorgenerally wasregionalised in itsimpact.\\nMoreover there was little prospect, as there had been in the\\nsixties,thatthese losses wouldbereplaced byjobsinother\\nindustries. Regional policy had been cut back,andanyway the\\neconomic conditions for itsoperation were by now far less\\npropitious , whilepublicexpenditure cutsremoved thatelementof\\ntheearlierperiod\\'squid pro quo. Finallythedeepening international\\nrecession, combined with the government\\'s commitment to policies\\nwhich led to high interestrates and high levels ofexchange for\\nsterling,provoked severecutbacks in manyoftheindustries which\\nhaddecentralised in the sixties and seventies.l? Unemployment in\\ntheDevelopment Areas rose dramatically. By late 1982 the ratein\\nNorthern Irelandwas 20 per cent, in theNorthandWales over 16\\npercentand inScotland over 14 per cent. The \\'regional issue\\'\\nbecame once againa focusofdiscontent.\\nBut this time it was notjustthetraditional regional-problem\\nregions which saw majorlossesofjobs. Theimpactofthe recession\\nwas very general; even the service industries were losing employ\\xad\\nment.

The rate ofunemployment in each ofthese two\\nregionswas soon abovethatforScotland . By the end of1982, the\\nfigures were over 15 per cent in boththe west midlands andthe\\nnorth-west. Inwhatwasdubbed\\'thefirstcombined statement ofits\\nkind\\' the chairpersons oftheCBI\\'swestmidlands ,north-west , and\\nYorkshire andHumberside regions issued a sterndemand for relief\\nfor industry (Garnett , 1982).

Ifone thing is clear\\nfrom theforegoing chapters it is that these characteristics ofBritish\\ncapital are also offundamental importance for the national geogra\\xad\\nphy.The geography of accumulation in these two different partsof\\ncapitalin theUnitedKingdom is quite \" distinct, and it is the\\ngeography of internationally-orientated capital which is increas\\xad\\ninglydominant and which lies behind the emerging spatial division\\noflabourand thestructure of spatial inequality.\\nIn this section we are concerned with the geography ofultimate\\ncontrolover the relations ofownership and possession. One thing is Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 265\\ncertain:thatcontrolisincreasingly exercised from the south-east of\\nEngland.However, theargument is morecomplicated thanitlooks\\nat first sight. The mostobvious fact isthattheheadquarters of\\nBritishinternational capitalis in the south-east , inandaround\\nLondon. This has been true ofbanking capitalforcenturies, andit\\nis trueofmostbig,internationalised Britishmanufacturing capital.\\nEach increase in the economic importance ofsuchcompanies brings\\nwith it also an increase in thespatialconcentration ofcontrolover\\ntherelations ofproduction andoveraccumulation. It wastrueof\\ntheemergence of newmanufacturing multinationals in the fifties.\\nThemergerboomof the late 1960sdid the same. While the aspatial\\nconcentration andcentralisation ofcapitalhasnotbrought in its\\ntrainspatialconcentration ofproduction activities, ithasbrought\\nwith itgeographical centralisation of therelationsofproduction, of\\ncontrolover the relations ofownership andpossession. Notonly\\ncentralisation but also concentration has had this effect. On the\\nwhole, the largerthecompany themorelikely it is to have a\\ndetached head office andthemorelikely it is thatthatoffice will be\\nin thesouth-east region. On the whole, therefore, it islargercapital\\nwhich is centralising theownership ofitsproduction inthatregion.\\nBut theformalcriterion ofabsolute sizealoneis not sufficient.\\nForone thing, a numberofvery large UK companies do havetheir\\nheadquarters \\'intheregions\\'.Whatisinteresting iswhich\\ncompanies theyare.AsCrumandGudgin (1977)pointout,they\\ntend to be companies which are confined to onebroadproduct-area\\nand which are based within a region where there is a historical\\nspecialisation withinthatproduct-area .Thus\\'Tootalremains in\\nManchester.l \\'Pilkington Bros. in St. Helens, CoatsPatonsin\\nGlasgow, Distillers inEdinburgh, andJosephLucasandTube\\nInvestments inBirmingham\\' (p. 113). Certainly thesecompanies are\\nhuge -andinternationalised -butCrumandGudginarerightto\\npointto their relatively confined productbases.\"Itissomething of\\nwhatwasreferred to inChapter 2 as aproduction ratherthana\\nfinancial orientation .Theremay, then, thoughthis needs further\\ninvestigation, bedifferences in type of company , in the social nature\\nofcapital, even within major,internationally-orientated capital,\\nbetween thatwhichcongregates inLondon andthesouthandeast\\nandthatwhich has moretendency toremainin itstraditional and\\nmoreperipheral fastnesses. Nonethe less it is truethatthe bulk of\\nlarge,internationalised Britishcapitalhas itsheadquarters in the\\nsouthand east ofEngland. 266SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\n\\'Modernising\\' the British economy in the sense understood in the\\n1960shadcontradictory effects, notonlyinthatthe newly\\xad\\nstrengthened international companies wentoffandinvested abroad\\n(whichitselfhadgeographical effects- ifonlyimplicit - in\\nremoving existingorpotential investment in thenational economy\\n- Singh, 1975) butalso inthatitreinforced thisspatialconcentra\\xad\\ntionofcontrolovertherelations ofproduction .

They are not overwhelmingly concerned with\\nexpansion , theessential ingredient ofcapitalist accumulation . They\\nretain, inotherwords,manyofthebehavioural characteristics of\\nthe classical pettybourgeoisie. InWright\\'s framework ,presented in\\nChapter 2, there is a dimension ofcontradictory locations between\\npettybourgeoisie andbourgeoisie. Itis aclassification adopted by\\nWrightonly for extremely small firms - he gives a range ofupper\\nlimitsofemployment, from ten to fifty employees. Thisis a\\ndefinition based, like the distinction between working classand\\ncapital, on the natureof theunderlying socialrelations ofvalue\\xad\\nproduction :\\'Whenapetty-bourgeois producer employs a single\\nhelper, there is an immediate changein the social relations of\\nproduction, for thelabourofaworkercan now be exploited . Still,\\nthesurplus-value appropriated from a single employee is likely to\\nbeverysmall\\' (p. 35). As thenumber ofemployees increases,\\nhowever, the proportion ofsurplusproduct generated assurplus\\nvalue by workers increases, andtheproportion generated by the\\nowner(andtheunpaidlabourofher/hisfamily) declines. \\'At some\\npoint[the latter] becomes less thanhalfofthetotalsurplusproduct,\\nandeventually becomes a small fractionofthetotalsurplus.Atthat\\npoint,thepetty-bourgeois producer becomes firmlyasmall\\ncapitalist\\' (pp.35-6). AsWrightsays, there is no a priori basis\\nfor saying how many employees turnsanemployer into acapitalist\\nin thoseterms.Itwilldependforinstanceontechnology, andit will\\nchangeover time. But whatis clear is that,on thiscriterion, the\\ncompanies being discussed here are plainly capitalist. The non\\xad\\naccumulative characteristics which they sharewith the classical\\npettybourgeoisie are the result ofsocialbehaviour ratherthanofan\\nunderlying structure ofvaluerelations.Itis notthatthispartof\\nproduction isconducted within the formal value relations ofpetty\\xad\\nbourgeois production. Itisthatin theUnitedKingdom asignificant 270SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsectionofcapitalconducts its business in a singularly undynamic ,\\neven\\'uncapitalist \\',fashion.\\nWhy is this important to theanalysishere? Because it is this kind\\nofcompany whichrepresents muchofwhatremains in theUnited\\nKingdom todayof\\'localcapita\\\\\\', much, in otherwords,ofwhat\\nremains inregionsotherthanthesouthandeastoflocally\\xad\\ncontrolled industry, andquitea bitofwhatis inthatregion too.\\nTheveryreasonsfor thesurvivalofsuchcompanies oftenexpress\\ntheircharacteristics. Threefactorsstandout from Boswell\\'s survey\\nofBritish firms ofup to 500 employees .Thefirst has been reliance\\noncheaplabour, in the case ofcottonand wool textiles usually\\nfemale, and oftenAsian.The lack ofregional policyincentives in\\nthehomeareasoftheseindustries, and the existinghigherfemale\\nactivityrates, may also have meantthattherewas less in-migrant\\ncompetition for such workers. In these cases the labourischeap\\nbecauseofits wider characteristics (sex, race) and the discrimina\\xad\\ntionassociated with them. In otherpartsofthe small- andmedium\\nfirmsectorthis kind oflabouris notemployed butthe\\'smallfirm\\nsector\\'as a whole is notorious for its low degree ofunionisation\\nand low pay, in parta result ofthenatureofthecompanies\\nthemselves and thedifficulties oforganising withinthem. Second, in\\nsomeindustries, andparticularl ycottonand wool textiles (Boswell,\\n1973)andfootwear (Mounfield, UnwinandGuy, 1982) geographi\\xad\\ncalcharacteristics themselve smayhavebeen significant. The\\nfrequent locationofplantsin these industries inisolated commu\\xad\\nnitieswherelabourhashadlittlebargaining power(Boswell,\\np. 115) has been a factorinkeeping wagesdown, while the\\ncoincidence within a very local geographical areaofthe whole\\npackageofworkforce ,management andownership (thelattertwo\\noftenthe same) has seemed to providesomesortoffocus for a\\ncommon frontbetween workers andowners,theonein defence of\\ntheirjobs,theotherindefenceoftheircompanies. (Itis not being\\nsuggested that\\'geography\\' itselfhas anecessary effect here. The\\nminingvillagesdiscussed inChapter 5 were very similarintheir\\npurelydescriptive spatialaspects, yettheirhistoryisofmuch\\ngreaterconflict.Itis thecombination ofthisparticular kindof\\ncapitalandaparticular segment ofthelabourforce [in this case\\nmainlywomen] - in otherwordsofaparticular setofsocial relations\\nin aparticular geographical structure -which is significant [seeUrry,\\n1980].) But the shifts which we have analysed inothersectionsof\\ncapitalseem likely to threaten bothofthese \\'advantages\\'. On the Class.

Inotherwords,the new geography of\\nproduction (asopposed tocontrol) insomesections ofbigcapital\\nmay welI pose a threatto thesurvivalofsomeoftheseremaining\\nstrongholds oflocalownership.\\nThethird,andthemain,factorin thesurvivalofthis typeoffirm\\nissimplerigidity- the very fact thattheownereithercannot, or\\nsimplydoesnotwantto,transfereithertheinvested cash,or him or\\nherselftoanother, morelucrative, sectorofproduction (Boswell,\\n1973).Thisisnotthe flexible capitalofbigintersectoral companies,\\nsearching formaximum profit.It iscommitment to the family\\nbusiness. It isnotthedynamism andentrepreneurship invoked in\\nmuchpolitical rhetoric aboutsmalIcompanies. Infact, as in the\\ncasesdescribed here, it has oftenbeen the very lack ofadriveto\\naccumulate which has preserved smalIandmedium-sized firms in\\nsuch large numbers. It isnotthensurprising thatoverandover\\nagainarea-based analyses pointto the fact thatlocalownership is\\nconcentrated inslower-growing sectors.\\nItisperhaps worthnotingthatmuchthesamegeneralpoint(the\\nlackofabilityto form a new independent dynamic ofaccumulation)\\nappliestootherkindsofsmallandmedium capitalevenwhereit is\\nnotofthis very traditional character. Thusinmanysectorssuch\\nfirmsarecompletely dependent onthedynamic ofthelarge\\ncompanies which they serve. Theform may vary: from sma11firms\\nproducing consumer goods,which are oftentied to,ordominated by,\\nmajorretailoutlets(see thediscussion ofclothing inChapter 4) to\\ncomponent manufacturers , as in the carindustry. But inmostcases,\\nalthough the small firms may be significant asemployers, andmay\\neven be, immediately, \\'responsible\\' for the creation ofnumerous\\njobs,theirposition in the overal1 structure oftheeconomy means\\nthatthe realdynamic ofaccumulation lieselsewhere, with the large\\ncapitalofthe retail companies or the big carfirms.\\nThereare,however, somesmal1companies which do have those\\nmuch-referred-to characteristics -entrepreneurship, growth-poten\\xad\\ntialandenterprise. Such firms exist, as we have seen, in electronics,\\nininstrument engineering, inproducer services.Theyarenot 272 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nalways, by any means, independent ofbig firms, but they may be\\nreal foci ofgrowth. They tend to be notonly small, but relatively\\nnew. They are also, in most cases, internationally-oriented. What\\ncharacterises themgeographically is theirconcentration inthat\\n\\'sunbelt\\'stretchfrom East Anglia to Southampton and Bristol. Not\\nonly are the sectors in which they are most frequent located mainly\\nin thesouth-east (see the examples in Chapter 4), but so is that\\nstratumofthepopulation which has the highest propensity tostart\\nnew firms - graduates , and those with otherformsofhigher\\neducation (Gudgin, Brunskill and Fothergill, 1979). This is much\\nthe same kind ofduality,then, as in self-employment in services,\\nwith the old and declining elements hangingon in varying degrees\\nover the countryas a whole but with the new and growing parts,\\nwith high statusand high income, being overwhelmingly concen\\xad\\ntratedin thesouth-east, plus a recent tendency to migrate to\\nneighbouring regions.!\" When one considers the factors which lie\\nbehindboththe easeofstartingup new firms and the potential for\\nsuccess, this regional distribution isunderstandable .Storey\\'s(1982)\\nresearch indicates two main conditions underlying thepropensity to\\nstartup new businesses: previous and dominant industry, and\\nfinance - particularly personal savings and second mortgages . We\\nhavealreadynotedhow the industrial structure ofthe heavy\\xad\\nindustry Development Areas worked againstnew-firm indigenous\\ngrowth(Chapter 5). Incontrast, thedistributions ofpersonal\\nsavings, ofowner-occupation andofhigh house prices are all\\nbiasedtowards thecentralregions. The background reasons for\\nsuccess - previous management experience, educational level and\\nlocalmarkets -pushin the same direction. Ofall the new\\ncompanies established in 1980, 35 per cent were based in the\\nsouth-east (Department ofIndustry). It does seem indisputable\\nthat, were there ever to be a \\'small-firm strategy\\' whichactually\\nworkedbut which was undifferentiated spatially, it would provide\\nmost benefit in employment terms to the southand eastofEngland\\n(Storey, 1982).The real social and economic distinctions which exist\\nwithinboththe small-firm and self-employment sectionsofthe\\neconomy are thus important spatially. Notonly do the distinct\\nelements have different geographical distributions, they also have\\ndifferent implications for future growth.\\nSo it is not justthatthegeography ofownership is increasingly\\nconcentrated in thesouthand east. The contrasts indynamism\\nbetween the different partsofcapital,together with their different Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 273\\ngeographical distributions, meansthatcontroloveraccumulation is\\neven more concentrated inthatcornerofthecountrythanisformal\\nownership . Thispictureis massively re inforced when we bringback\\ninto the picturebanking capital,stilloperating to a large extent\\nfrom its old home -basein the City ofLondon, andfrom here\\ncontrolling notjustthe financial sectoritselfbut also, to varying\\ndegrees, otherpartsof theeconomy. Inavarietyofways, then,\\nspatialcentralisation of realcontroloverproduction , over the\\nprocessofaccumulation, isoccurring to anextentfargreaterthan\\nthatwhichwouldbeindicated bythesimpletallying-up of\\nheadquarters, weighted, say, by employment. Forit is precisely in\\nthosepartsoftheeconomy which lead the process ofaccumulation\\nthatthesouthand east is increasingly important as thelocationof\\ncontrol.Incounterposition to this, the rest ofthecountryissubject\\ntoexternal control(thatis, the more strategic functions in the\\noverallrelations ofownership andpossession areabsent)to a\\ndegreegreaterthanisevidentin the figures for legal ownership.\\nThe divisions within,andcharacteristics of, Britishcapitalwhich\\nareimportantto aneconomic andpolitical analysisoftheUnited\\nKingdom andits rise anddeclineas acapitalist power,are\\nfundamental also to its industrial geography .Conversely thebroad\\ndivisions oftheeconomy which are appropriate to ageographical\\nanalysisreflect fhat long economic andpolitical history. The whole\\nstructure isdominatedbyrelatively dynamic andinternationally\\xad\\norientated financial and industrial companies (andmuchofthe\\naccumulation which is controlled from the southand east is, of\\ncourse,abroad- not in the UnitedKingdom at all). The \\'restof\\nBritishindustry\\' is very much whatremains, in terms ofgeogra\\xad\\nphically-local control, in\\'therestofBritain\\'.And,ofcourse, the\\nnational geography is alsomarkedbythelong-lingering inheritance\\nofEmpire andofcommitment to aninternational role.The\\nimportance ofinternationally-orientated capitalis oneaspectof\\nthis but in otherways too British industrial geography bears the\\nmarksof thenational role ofmorethanacenturyago,justasmuch\\nas do the economy andthe class structure . While in the Develop\\xad\\nment Areas the decline ofthe old production-bases ofEmpire\\ncontinues tocreatepovertyandunemployment , thefinancial sideof\\ntheinternational role, based in the south-east ,continues to flourish.\\n* * *So far we have lookedonly at a very broadsketch,andconsidered\\nonlythedistribution ofownership. Looking belowthat,and 274SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nconsidering also wider questions ofspatialorganisation, the geo\\xad\\ngraphyofdirectproduction, there is a more complex picture.There\\naresubdivisions .withineachofthemajorgroups.Withinbig\\nindustrial capitalinthedynamic partsoftheeconomy, for\\ninstance, electronics majorsare not like chemical giants, nor yet\\nagain like multinational clothing companies . Here,technology and\\nlabourprocess in particular areimportant, thoughnot on their own\\na defining characteristic . The great differences in spatialstructure\\nare related to contrasts inlabourprocess, to the long-term natureof\\ntechnological development, and to the related social patternsofthe\\nworkforce.\\nThere are also clear divides within thatgroupofmiddle-sized and\\nsmallcompanies stiIlattempting to tick over quietly in the regions\\nwhere they have long been based. I?First,there are the small-scale\\nfirms involved in the production ofbasic goods and means of\\nproduction : the firms which turn out nuts, bolts, fasteners, iron\\xad\\ncastings, small-batch-production machine tools and so on. They\\ntend to have heavy, non-standardised labourprocesses in terms of\\nthe work involved and, overwhelmingly, they employ men. The\\ndominant unions are the AUEWand theTGWU. Thecompanies\\narelocated,geographically, largely in the heartlands ofmanufactur\\xad\\ningindustry, the west midlands mostobviously, but also in other\\nareas. The marketis often local, the companies are often deeply\\nintegrated into their regional economies, and often dependent on\\none or two ofthe larger producers in those economies .Thereis\\nincreasing international tradein some ofthese goods, and some\\nfirms in these industries are beginning to feel the impactofforeign\\ncompetition , but most of all these firms are suffering from the\\ngeneralrundown of the British economy and in particular its\\nmanufacturing sector. Because oftheir place in the economy, they\\narevictimsofdeindustrialisation as well as partof it.Theirappeal\\nfor aid is often in terms ofbeing vital to recovery, to argue that\\ntheirdisappearance wouldhinderanynational economic recon\\xad\\nstruction . The machine tool industrywas the focus of this attention\\nin the 1960s and a whole series of othershave followed. Inlate\\n1982, the fastener industry representatives (the British Industrial\\nFasteners\\' Federation) arguedthattheirs was a strategic sector. A\\nnumberoftheindustries hazeundergone co-ordinated rundown ;\\ntheir decline isan element in the general decline ofskilled and semi\\xad\\nskilledmanualjobsfor men in manufacturing . Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 275\\nIncomplete contrast isthatgroupofcompanies engaged in the\\nproduction ofwhatmight be called old-fashioned consumer goods\\nandrelatedindustries -clothing, textiles, footwear, cutleryand\\nhosiery. Because of their different place in the economy ,andalso in\\nmanycases the greatertransportability oftheirproducts, these\\nindustries are not so much threatened by thedeindustrialisation of\\nBritain,they are one of the mostdramatic elementsofit.Production\\nintheUnitedKingdom in theseindustries isunderseverethreatin the\\ncontextdirectlyofthechanging international divisionoflabour.The\\ndeclinein these industries leads the declineofothers.Textile\\nmachinery has been a recent victim. Intheseindustries the claim on\\ntheStateis usually in terms ofdemands forimportcontrols.In\\nfurthercontrast to thenuts-and-bolts group,thispartoftheeconomy\\nhashistorically employed a muchmoreimportant elementof female\\nlabour.This isparticularly true of the c1othing-footwear-hosiery\\ngroup.Others,though,such ascutlery,have been sourcesmainlyof\\njobsfor men. Again in contrast with the big cross-sector unions\\ntypicalofthemeans-of-production industries, manyofthesesectors\\nhaveindustry-specific unions;as wesaw in Chapter4, inclothingand\\nfootwear there was anxiety on the partofmanagement to keep it that\\nway.Historically ,these industries pre-date theIndustrial Revolution,\\ntheirproducts are basic consumer goods,andtheirproduction in the\\nUnitedKingdom hasoftenslowly evolved througha seriesofstages\\ntofully-capitalistandfactory production.Theirgeograph y is\\ndifferent, too, from the nuts-and -boltsindustries. Interestingly , for\\nthese are consumer-goods industries, they areprobably lessmarket\\xad\\norientated. Asurprisingnumberofthem have developed over the last\\ncoupleofcenturies veryparticular localandregional bases - as we\\nsaw in the case offootwear inChapter 4. Andmanyofthemedium\\xad\\nsized and smaller companies are still there.\\n* * *Economic, socialandgeographical contrasts within\\'Britishcapital\\'\\nareintegrally boundup with each other.Thesearejusta few\\nexamples. Whatthey show is thateachofthe\\'criteria\\' discussed\\ninChapter 2 isimportant: theirsignificance has been seen a number\\noftimes in the foregoing chapters. Atdifferent pointsandin\\ndifferent ways they cross-cut andareinterwoven with each other\\nand inthatguise are partoftheanalysis ofthecomplex, and\\nparticular, pictureofthe social economy andgeography ofBritish\\ncapital. 276SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nWhite-collar hierarchies\\nThecentralisation ofcontrolover relations ofeconomic ownership\\nandofpossession in the south-east feeds down through manage\\xad\\nmenthierarchies to sitesofproduction throughout thecountry.\\nThrough thespatialextension of these relations ofproduction a\\nvarietyof\\'interregional relations\\' ofcontrolisestablished. Different\\nplaces in these tentacular forms of organisation are occupied by\\ndifferent kinds and levels ofmanagement, and thisstructure in turn\\nis related to social differentiation . The higher the social status, the\\nmore likely to be in the south-east ; thefurtherremoved from direct\\nproduction in afunctional sense, the furtherremoved also in many\\ncases in a spatialsense. In terms oftheframework ofsocial\\nstructure discussed in Chapter 2, this is the dimension between\\nbourgeoisie (which includes a fair slice oftopmanagement) and\\nworkingclass. And we have seen from the studies in Chapters 4 and\\n5 how increasingly in a numberofimportant partsofthe British\\neconomy thisdimension ofsocialstructure has adefinite and\\nsystematic geographical form.\\nWe have seen also thatmuch the same is true ofthespectrum of\\nproduction engineers, technicians, technologists and scientists. Both\\nbetween different kindsofproduction andwithinparticular\\nsegments oftheeconomy there is a developing relationbetween\\nsocialposition andspatiallocation. Industries in which \\'scientific\\ninput\\'came from engineers in the old sense, highly qualified but\\nwith a close relationtoproduction, bothfunctionally and geogra\\xad\\nphically, are becoming proportionately lessimportant. The old\\n\\'engineering universities\\' were in the regionsofengineering\\nproduction. We saw in Chapter 4 some elements ofthe decline of\\ntheindustrial-social structure which has been going on at least since\\nthe fifties (with the introduction into old firms ofelectronics-based\\nscientists), but the precipitate collapseofengineering and engineer\\xad\\ning-related industries since the late seventies has accelerated the\\nprocess. In contrast, industries where there is a far longer and more\\nhighly-differentiated division oflabouron thetechnical and\\nscientific side, and where the upperechelons ofthathierarchy\\nmay be quite removed in an immediate functional sense from direct\\nproduction have grown in relative importance, and grew in absolute\\nterms very strongly in the sixties and partsofthe seventies. Once\\nagain,functional distance fromproduction has often gone along\\nwithgeographical distance. In terms ofthe social framework Class, Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 277\\nintroduced inChapter 2 thisspectrum ofpeople is best charac\\xad\\nterised along the dimension between petty bourgeoisie andworking\\nclass, and as the social statusgets\\'higher\\'(greater degreesof\\nautonomy ,greaterdistance from the working class) so does the\\nlikelihood oflivingin the southand eastofEngland. It isironic that\\nthe long-time calls for a raising ofthe lowstatusof\\'engineers\\', a\\nlowstatuswhich itself was partand parcel of the low statusin\\ngeneralaccorded toproduction within the social structure of\\nBritain, have only found an answer with the functional distancing\\nof engineering, in the scientific sense, from production. In this\\naspectofindustry as inmanagement thedevelopment ofthe\\ndivisionoflabourhas extended the range ofsocialstratainvolved\\nand increased their social separation. Ithas also increased their\\ngeographical separation.\\nThere is, as we have seen, some difference in Britain between the\\ngeography ofhigher-status scientists and technologists on the one\\nhandandofhighermanagerial groupson theother.It is a\\ndifference, again, which reflects their contrasting functions within\\nthe overall relations ofproduction. Management is moreconurba\\xad\\ntion-oriented , and specifically London-based. Research and devel\\xad\\nopmentstaffcan more often be found in the comparative seclusion\\nof asecondhand country mansion somewhere in the crescent of\\ncountrystretching from Bristol through the Home Counties and\\nintoEastAnglia-the\\'Britishsunbelt\\'.Itisthislatterdistribution\\ninparticular which is sharedwith the new entrepreneurs, the\\ndynamic endofthe small-firm sector. Itisaroundthesegroups\\nthatthe\\'sunbelt\\' has developed. To the extent thatthere has been\\nanysignificant movement inrecentyears, it has been the\\ndecentralisation ofheadquarters, andtherefore ofuppermanage\\xad\\nment to the area. Financial companies moving lock, stock and\\nbarrel from London to Bristol, for instance. Such shifts reinforce\\nboth the decline ofLondon as a centre ofemployment and the\\ndominance and social character ofthe sunbelt. Finally, this general\\npattern,oftheconcentration ofhigh-status jobsin this crescent of\\ncountry, isstimulated and reinforced by the geographical structure\\nofcertainelements ofStateemployment. This is, as we saw in\\nChapter4,particularly trueofthe central State. Local State sectors\\nare oneofthe few sources of professional jobsin\\'theregions\\', and\\nthis is true particularly for women.\\nSouthern and eastern stretches ofEngland, then, are home to a\\nvarietyofdifferent elements ofthe higher reaches ofwhite-collar 278 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nstrata.Theincreasing importance ofeach over the long term reflects\\nanumberofhistorical developments within British capitalism : the\\nconcentration ofownership, thechanging division oflabourin\\nsociety as a whole, the increasing divorcebetween mental and\\nmanual labourinproduction, andthegrowthoftheState\\napparatus .Thegroupincludes thetopendofmanagement\\nhierarchies ofmultiregional firms, the morerarified partsof\\nresearch and development in science-based industries, the profes\\xad\\nsionalsof thegrowing service sectors, the City, the upper-level civil\\nservants of thecentralState,the centres ofthe oldprofessions , and\\nthegraduate entrepreneurs .Performing different functions within\\nsociety as a whole, they nonetheless sharemuch in common\\nsocially. This is not, of course, the only partofthecountry in\\nwhich such people are to be found. In earlierchapters we have\\nnoted\\'research outliers\\', innorthern Cheshire forinstance and\\naroundEdinburgh, andthere are the more environmentally minded\\nelements of small-business entrepreneurship which have taken up\\nresidence in places such as Cornwall. But as a generalisation ofthe\\noverallpattern, thisbroadpictureis not unfair.\\nWe have seen in Chapter 4 anumberofthedetailed reasons\\nwhich lie behind this pattern,both the fact ofconcentration and its\\nlocation in thesouthand east. Reasons ofcontactand linkage,\\nordering patterns, thecommunity ofscientists, the community of\\nclass, the functioning oflabourmarkets, and social and residential\\npreferences . Over the longerspan ofhistorythepatternhas much to\\ndo,ofcourse, simply with the fact thatLondon is thecapitaland\\nthattheStateand all its centraldemands in terms ofgoods and\\nservices emanated from there. Itwas from here too thatthe\\nfinancial sectorplayed such a partinorganising international\\ntrade.Onceestablished, such acentrecangenerate its own\\nmomentum. Over the last halfcenturythelocationofthecentral\\nStatehas been very important to theelectronics industry, for\\ninstance, muchofwhichdeveloped through, andoften still is\\nclosely related to, the militaryand defence establishment.\\nSo the fact thattheheadquarters ofStateand Empire have been\\nin thesouth-east has been an important starter-motor for this\\nprocess of concentration . And we have seen thateven the most iron\\nofprimeministers failed to move them. But why notmove the\\nForeign Office, say, or the Ministry of Defence, to Longbenton ,\\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne? The clerical jobsin social security were\\ndecentralised there.Thereare of course many reasons of\\'linkage\\' Class. Politics and the Geography ofEmployment 279\\nand\\'contact\\' which might militateagainstsuch a move, or call for\\nsomethoughtful reorganisation. But there are otherreasons, too,\\nand most of them revolve aroundsocial power.\\nBetween them, indeed, the upperechelons ofthesewhite-collar\\nsocialstratamore or less \\'control\\' thegeography ofemployment in\\nBritain. This is obvious in a simple way ofmanagement in the\\nlarger firms - they make the \\'location decisions\\' - and they do so, as\\nwe have argued,in thecontextofwidereconomic conditions . But\\nthere is also an element, as we have seen, of more purely social\\npower. The spatialimmobility ofupper-echelon civilservantsispart\\nof this, and so is whatseems to be the presently -increasing social\\nandspatialpoweroftheupperend of the spectrum oftechnologists\\nand scientists. Ever since the end of the Second WorldWar this\\ngrouphas been centrally important botheconomically and\\npolitically. Scientists and technologists emerged from the war and\\nintoreconstruction with greatly enhanced prestige: \\'thesense of\\nelitestatuswhich derived from membership ofthe new technolo\\xad\\ngical club, played no small partin the decision of manyconcerns to\\ninvest in development laboratories\\' (BurnsandStalker, 1961,\\np. 43). The defence programme reinforced thatposition. In the\\nsixties, as we have seen, science and technology wereregarded as\\nthecentralelements in modernising andtherebyrescuing the British\\neconomy. At thatpointit wasprimarily scientists in the labora\\xad\\ntories of large companies who were the focus ofattention and the\\nlocational form in which they were embedded was often the kind of\\nhierarchical structure described inChapter 4 forelectronics. By the\\nlate seventies and early eighties it was the scientist-as-entrepreneur\\nwho held centrestage and the terms of the locational emphasis had\\nshifted to things such as science parks. Some individuals moved\\nbetween groups. In the later period there were management buy\\xad\\noutsand various company-promoted schemesofgoing solo, where\\nformer employees turnedthemselves into self-employed subcon\\xad\\ntractors. Butwhatever thenatureoftheireconomic or ideological\\nsignificance it carriedwith itlocational power. Such people have\\nconsiderable freedom to decide where they want to work.

Indeed, one ofthecentralstakesat issue for the\\nwhole of this period has been the shape, organisation andstrength\\noflabour.\\'Geography \\', as we have seen, has not merely reflected\\nthatbattle; it has been one ofthe cards in the game.\\nOver and above everything else which has happened since the\\n1960s has been the erosion ofsomeofthecentralbastions of\\nworking-class trade union strength, the oldheartlands ofthelabour\\nmovement. The old sectoral union bases, in mining for instance,\\nhavecontinued , and often accelerated, their steep numerical decline,\\nandwhatthathasthreatened totakewith it has been the\\ngeographical coresoflabourism . There have been otherequally\\ndistinctive and equally majorlosses: the result ofdeindustrialisa\\xad\\ntion.Ithas been the cities and the midlands and the north-west\\nwhich have been most caughtup in this decline, and general and\\ncraft,rather\\'than sectoral, unions; unions like Ute TOWUand the\\nAUEW.Ithas been partoftherecomposition oftheworking class\\naway from male manualworkers.

The \\'sunbelt\\' was not empty before the\\narrivalofthe middle class. Deindustrialisation has also humbled\\neven the more-recently developed centresofmilitancy .The\\ndevastation of Merseyside, including theattackon the car industry\\nthere, is the most obvious example. There are many otherpartsof\\nthe economy losing jobs(the fall in employment for women in\\nindustries such as clothing has been massive), but in terms ofthat\\nold defensive strengthandstraightforward economic militancy, the\\nonesjustlisted are probably the most crucial losses. Whatstands\\nout is how much has gone. This is not a simple rerunof the 1930s:\\nthis time the concatenation of events is takingwith it not one but\\ntwo or three generations ofunionstrength. 282SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nWithin the working class also, the geography offunctions, of\\nindividual jobcontrol,ofautonomy, ischanging . This is particu\\xad\\nlarly evident in the decline of skilled manualjobs.We saw in\\nChapter 5 how the old skills and customs of individual jobcontrol\\nhaveactuallyprovedproblematical toindustries newly-arriving in\\nperipheral regions, employing redundant miners but having no\\ndemandfor such humanassets. The skills ofwhich such jobshave\\nbeenshornareconcentrated inotherpartsofthecountry.The same\\nis true too of a significant proportion ofthe newjobsfor women in\\nthese regions. In regions such as these, the old coalfields, a curious\\ndoubleandcontradictory process is underway. At the same time\\nand by the same process as local cohesiveness within the workforce\\nhas been undermined, by an increase in the variety ofindustries,\\nemployers, and so on, so the monofunctionality ofwork, and the\\nlack ofcontrolover the individual work-process, has increased.\\nFunctions and places within the relations ofproduction have been\\nseparated out,allocated todifferent socialgroups,andgeographi \\xad\\ncally removed.\\nAll these spatialchanges have been partand parcel ofthe shifting\\nnational composition oftheworking class. The periodas a whole\\nhas seen more thanjobloss and unemployment. Withinthat,as we\\nhave seen, there have also been majorchanges in skill and gender\\ncomposition .Increasing numbers ofwomen have been draftedinto\\nthelabourforce,public-sector andwhite-collar clericaljobshave,\\nover the periodas a whole, expanded ,non-manual jobshave\\nexpanded at the expense ofmanual, and older craft-related skills\\nhavecontinued to be diluted.\\nIt is,moreover, notjustthattherecomposition ofworking-class\\njobs,andofunemployment, has had a geographical form, it is also\\nthatgeographical form and spatialmobility has been integral to\\nrecomposition . Thecombination ofapreviously economically\\xad\\ninactive reserve and high unemployment ,together at times with\\nthechanging demands ofthedominant production processes, have\\nenabledcapitalwithin Britain to cut costs and increase its control\\nby shifting locationto lessorganised workers. At the same time, it\\nhas left unemployed those whose participation in theprevious\\ncentury\\'s patternofproduction enabled them to become stronger\\nand more organised .Whatincrease in employment there was for\\nworking-class peopleduringthis period on the whole avoidedthe\\nnewly-unemployed workforce ,bothin thecitiesandin the\\nDevelopment Areas, and instead soughtout new reserves oflabour Class.

It is certainly truethatboththe decline of\\nthe old and the form ofthe newcomposition andgeography of the\\nworking classpresentdifficulties to the construction ofacoherent\\nworkforce organisation . The solid old bastions, and some ofthe\\nnewer foci of militancy, havebeen weakened. Conditions in the\\ncities, the fact ofthatkindofgeographical environment, the density\\nofthe social network, the links between plants,the kinds of\\n(manufacturing) industry which were dominant, provided propi\\xad\\ntiousconditions forbuilding solidarity (Lane, 1982). Whatremains\\ntodayoftheprivatesectorin the cities - small firms and the service\\nsector- isnotoriously difficult to organise. Thescattering of more\\nisolatedplantsinsmallertowns, and in rural and semi-rural areas,\\nparticularly given the kind oflabourtheyemploy, seems to be a\\nmuch less helpful startingpoint.Indeed,we have seen thatspatial\\nisolation can at times be an explicit element of managerial location\\nstrategy. Onceagainsocialandspatialrecomposition ofthe\\nworkforce reinforce eachother.Putthistogether withthe\\nsocially-orientated location strategyofmanagements andtechni\\xad\\ncians and one gets a vision of a future geography ofindustry:\\nmanagement acting out its dreamsof a rural idyll, workforce\\nobligingly docile in widely-scattered factories, or clustered in smalI\\ngroupsontrading estates.

Also it is notthe case thatin allpartsofthe\\ncountrysuchcoherence is beingdismantled . In some regions- for\\nexample, Cornwall, thesouth-west moregenerally, EastAnglia- an\\nindustrial waged-labour-force ofanysize isonlyjustbeing\\nconstructed .

Multi-locational companies certainly increase the\\ndangerofdividing workers withincompanies, butthey also form\\na basis for different formsoforganisation -combines, forinstance\\n- and hold outsomepotential fornetworks oflinkages spanning\\nthecountry. Thelong-term growthofemployment inpublic-sector\\nservices holds outpossibilities bothoflinksbetween workers in\\ndifferent partsofthecountryandofconnections between employ\\xad\\nmentand service provision at amorelocalcommunity level.Itis\\nsometimes arguedthatthenewly-emerging geography ofemploy\\xad\\nmentis initselfessentially negative ground fortradeunion\\norganisation .Thecontrast isposedbetween highlyintegrated\\nindustrial cities and regions andruralisolation, individual labour\\nmarkets dominated byindividual plants(Lane,1982). But even\\nbetween these extremes the issue is not entirelyclear.Certainly in\\nthestudiesinearlierchapters (infootwear, forinstance,andthe\\nLancashire textileindustry) there have been cases in which such\\nlocality-structures have been one element in asituation more\\ngenerally inimical to organisation . But only one element. It was\\nthecombination ofparticular socialrelations in aparticular\\ngeographical structure which was really decisive. Theevidence\\nfromLockwood (1958), from Sayles (1958) and from the mining\\nvillagesofsouthWales shows thatadifferent combination ofsocial\\nrelations, but in a similarspatialstructure, can produce a very\\ndifferent result.Geography matters, butitdoesnotinitself\\ndetermine anyparticular socialoutcome. 286SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThepresentmajorgeographical reorganisation ofthe British\\nworking classrepresents, not some final defeat, but new problems\\nand new preconditions. Indeed, precisely as the economic strength\\nofourlargest cities is underattack,so those cities have become\\nimportant foci for resistance, new alliances are being constructed\\noutofthe wreckage, determined thatit shall go no further,andthat\\nreconstruction might be on otherterms. The response varies also by\\nregion. A reassertion of defensive solidarity in the old regions ofthe\\nindustrial periphery, anunbelieving clinging toindividualistic\\nconsumerism inpartsofthe midlands. Different periodsand forms\\nofpasteconomic development havecreatedtheconditions for very\\ndifferent labourmovements, and the legacy they leave as industrial\\ndecline sets in is correspondingly distinct.Itis truethatthegreater\\nmobilityofcapitalgives it the advantage in setting the terms ofthe\\nconflict. Indeed its high and increasing spatialmobility may prove\\nthehardestproblem to overcome, greaterthan thecharacteristics of\\nanyparticular newlocational pattern. The changes going on at the\\nmomentcan beconceptualised in termsofa shift between dominant\\nspatialdivisions of labour. Butthatis to talk of a social process,\\ninvolving disruption, change, and conflict: as such the outcome is\\nalwaysuncertain. 7\\nThe Reproduction ofInequality: A\\nQuestion ofPolitics\\nTheperiodwehave been lookingat has been a crucialone for British\\nsociety.Economically, sociallyandpolitically it hasundergone\\nenormous changes.Ithas also been transformed geographically .\\nThe old spatialdivisionoflabourbased on sector,oncontrasts\\nbetweenindustries, has gone into accelerated declineandin its place\\nhas arisen to dominance aspatialdivisionoflabourin which a\\nmoreimportant component is theinterregional spatialstructuring\\nofproduction withinindividual industries .Relations between\\neconomic activity in different partsofthecountry are now a\\nfunction ratherless ofmarketrelations between firms andrather\\nmore ofplannedrelations within them. Relations ofproduction are\\nincreasingly centralised in thesouthand east ofthecountry. There\\nis agrowing geographical, as well as social, division between\\nconception andexecution. Thecontinuing elements ofsectoral\\ndifferentiation only serve to reinforce thisdichotomy . Thegrowth\\nofnew\\'hi-tech\\' industries -biotechnology is aprimeexample - is\\nlargely in the already-favoured areas.Thisis the new spatial\\ndivision of labour,and itbringswith it a new north-southdivide.\\nThis time it is between the \\'sun belt\\'and the rest, where \\'therest\\'\\nconsistsofrelatively decentralised employment andgreatpools of\\nunemployment whereproduction used to be. Thisis,ofcourse, a\\nsimplification. Thedetail,as we have stressed andshall stress, is\\nmore complex, but the old form of the regionalproblem was always\\ncaricatured too. And the broadpictureisundeniable.\\nSpatialinequality hasdramatically changed its form.The indices,\\nthe social structure and themapitself: all have been transformed .\\nThe new kinds ofspatialorganisationofproduction nolongerlead\\ntoproblems ofexcessive dependence ofparticular areason\\nparticular industries .Insteadthey bring with them all the problems\\nof thecloning,part-process, subcontracting andotherspatial\\nstructures discussed in previous chapters. Thereis alsoanother\\nmajordifference. The spatialdivisionoflabourwhich was based\\naroundindustrial differentiation andspecialisation onlyproduced a\\n287 288SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\n\\'regional problem\\' when the sector in which the area was specialised\\nwent into decline or moved away. In the case ofthe newer spatial\\nstructures, and most particularly in the case ofthepart-process\\nstructure, thiscorrespondence between industrial andregional\\ndecline no longer holds. Increasingly, the ways in which companies\\nare being organised over space mean thatgeographical inequality is\\nactually inherent in thespatialstructure itself. In a way which is\\ntrueneitherofsectoral specialisation and local controlnor of\\nsimplebranch-plantstructures, this kind ofuseofspace isactually\\npredicated uponspatialinequality ; it requires it -and necessarily\\nreproduces it.Companies operating production hierarchies both\\ndependon andreproduce inequality while they are healthyand\\ngrowing. We have stressed a numberof times in the course ofthis\\nanalysis thatspatialinequality does not simply increase with the\\nhistorical development ofcapitalist society;thatthe process is more\\ncomplex, involving changes in form and natureas well as degree.\\nThatis true, but what does need to be said aboutthe new form and\\nnatureofgeographical inequality in Britain is thatit is integral not\\nto decline but to growth- or, at least, growthin anyofthe terms\\nwhich have been tried since the I960s. Itbecomes even more\\napposite to ask \\'a regional problem for whom?\\'\\nThe term \\'regional\\' is here, as throughout, being used generically\\nfor\\'spatial\\', orsubnational. Forit isclear thateven theshapeofthe\\nmap has been refashioned. Thecontours of the new spatialdivision\\noflabouraredifferent from those ofthe old. The \\'sunbelt\\' crosses\\nsouth-west ,south-east, eastmidlands and East Anglia. Regions\\nonly recently \\'central\\' in terms ofprosperity havejoinedthe\\neconomic periphery. And the geography we areactually faced\\nwith, the result ofthecombination ofanemergent spatialdivision\\noflabourwith the declining but stil1presentform of the old, is\\nhighlyintricate. No longer is there really a \\'regional\\' problem in the\\nold sense. No longer is there a fairly straightforward twofold\\ndivision, along a single line between central,prosperous areas and\\na decaying periphery . The map ofunemployment itself has under\\xad\\ngone a change, the persistent decline of the periphery now being\\naddedto by collapse in manufacturing regions and urbanareas.\\nEveryone ofthe\\'standard regions\\', prosperous orotherwise ,\\nincludes within it enormous variation, is inparticular plunged\\nthroughby thedereliction of the inner cities.\\nWithinthebroad-brush picturepresented earlier, then, there is a\\ncomplex mosaic ofgreat variety. The \\'Britishspatialproblem\\' of The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 289\\nthe lastquarterofthetwentieth centuryreflectsboththecontinued\\nreproduction oftheproblems andinequalities ofprevious spatial\\ndivisions oflabourand also, superimposed uponit, a new layer of\\ndisparities, thoseofthepresently emerging spatialdivision of\\nlabour.Itis precisely because this isnota simple processof\\ndeepening inequality but the superimposition ofdifferentstruc\\xad\\nturesthatdifferent regions gothrough different kinds(even\\ndifferent directions) ofchange.Thedynamic ofsocialreproduction\\nvariesgeographically andso do its effects on social composition .In\\nthe coalfields the old homogeneity of theworking class is being\\nbrokendown and the starkness of itsdistinction fromotherclasses\\nbeingblurred. Inmanyruralareas there is an increase in the\\nimportance ofaworking-class element in the social structure, and a\\ndeclineofsomeothercomponents .Inthesouth-east a process of\\nsocial dichotomisation appearsto beunderway. While professional\\nandmanagerial strataincrease in importance, manualworkers face\\na lossofmanufacturing jobsandadeclineinconditions of\\nemployment as casual work, the service sector,andwork within\\nsmall firms grow in relative importance .Different partsofthe\\ncountry havedifferent relationships with the international econo\\xad\\nmy, some functioning as theproduction outposts ofmultinational\\ncapital, someasmoreself-contained ornationally-orientated\\neconomies, othersas themselves bases for international empires.\\nWhen one puts all this together with the fact thatthe\\'regions\\' and\\n\\'localities \\' are themselves constantly beingformedandre-formed ,\\nconstructed anddisintegrated, thecomplexity ofthemosaicthatis\\nBritishindustrial geography isevident.\\nSo, too,shouldbe theimportance ofrecognising thatcomplexity\\nin analysis. Local uniqueness matters.Capitalistsociety, it is well\\xad\\nrecognised, develops unevenly. The implications aretwofold.Itis\\nnecessary tounearth thecommon processes, thedynamic of\\ncapitalist society,beneath theunevenness ,butit is also necessary\\ntorecognise, analyse andunderstand thecomplexity ofthe\\nunevenness itself.Spatialdifferentiation ,geographical variety, is\\nnotjustanoutcome:it isintegralto thereproduction ofsocietyand\\nitsdominant socialrelations. Thechallenge is to hold the two sides\\ntogether; tounderstand the general underlying causes while at the\\nsame time recognising andappreciating theimportance ofthe\\nspecificandtheunique.\\nSo a new social and industrial geography is in themaking, and a\\nnew set of disparities iscomingon to the agenda.Anoutcome of 290 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nchanging international andnational classrelations, this new spatial\\ndivision oflabouralso had the groundprepared for it by the\\npreceding one: the social reproduction ofinequality, one form of\\nspatialorganisation being aprecondition for the next. In Chapter5,\\nwe saw this process in operation in the coalfields. The presentlack\\nof\\'indigenous growth\\'in these regions is now frequently blamed,\\nbyacademics andpoliticians alike, on their \\'lack ofentrepreneur \\xad\\nship\\'. But to talk ofa lack of entrepreneurship is tocomment upon\\none aspect of class structure, and, as we have seen, in these regions\\nthe lackofa significant element of small capitalis to animportant\\nextent due to their previous industrial history-through boththe\\ndominance ofoligopolistic structures and the lack of development\\nofthosewhite-collar and technical stratafrom which \\'entrepre\\xad\\nneurs\\'typically emerge. Further, thenon-generation ofany real\\n\\'middle-class\\' strataunderthe previous division of labourproduced\\na lackoftheirassociated \\'culture and society\\' (Morgan, 1980,\\npp.31-2).Thiscombines withanother inheritance ofthe old\\nindustries - thedespoliation ofthenaturaland built environment\\n- to reinforce the difficulties of attracting theupperechelons of\\ntechnical and managerial staffin the new spatialstructures . Finally,\\nthe existence and the natureof the reserve offemalelabourhas\\nprovided one of the most important attractions to theincoming\\nindustries . It was not only the existence ofa reserve of labourwhich\\nwasimportant, but also the fact of its low levels oforganisation .\\nAnd these character istics - the lack ofprevious experience ofwage\\nrelations, themasculinity and sexism ofthe local culture- owe not\\na little to the preconditions established underthedominance of the\\nprevious spatialdivisionoflabour.\\nWhatwe see here are some of the mechanisms of thereproduc\\xad\\ntion of the spatialstructures ofdominance andsubordination and\\ntheirassociated effects. The process by which one use ofspace lays\\nthepreconditions foranotheris a complex one, and dependson the\\npolitical andorganisational response ofthe classes and social\\ngroupsinvolved. Whathashappened in these areas is thatboth\\nthe social dimensions ofinterregional differentiation andthe\\nunderlying economic structures on which they are based have\\nundergone atransformation. Thesubordination ofthese regions\\ncontinues , but the form ofthatsubordination and its social effects\\narechanging.\\nAgain, at the otherendofthecountrythe initial locationofthe\\nmachinery oftheState, and the concentration of\\'highstatus The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 291\\npeople\\',in thesouth-east ofEngland has been an important reason\\nfor thelatter\\'sincreasing concentration there. This is, again, not\\njustan\\'economic\\' mechanism but amechanism ofsocial class.\\nResidential preferences, andmoreparticularly thedifferential\\nability to operatethem, are a social means by which this stratum,\\nincreasingly important inabsolute terms as a result ofchanges in\\nproduction, has become so spatially concentrated . It is in a sense a\\nclass process ofcumulative causation and adynamic which is very\\ndifferent fromthatfound in otherpartsofthe social structure and\\ninotherpartsofthecountry. Here too the new spatialdivisionof\\nlabouris being built on the past.\\nIf the old spatialdivisionoflabourlaid the basis for the further\\nreproduction ofgeographical inequality, whataboutthe new one?\\nWhatare its dynamics; what does it hold in store? Itseems all too\\nclearthatittoocontains within it the basis for the further\\nreproduction ofinequality . In the old industrial Development\\nAreas, and in otherregionsofthecountry, the high levels of\\nexternalcontrol,the low levels oflinkage, the redundancy ofthe old\\nskillsoftheworkforce and the lack ofnew ones providelittle basis\\nforindigenous private-sector growth. In the\\'sunbelt\\' of thesouth\\nand east the cumulative causation which is underway will be\\ndifficult tostopby anyofthepresently accepted policiesof\\nindividual firm incentives. Thereare some signs ofchange; a few\\nheadquarters have been decentralised fromLondon, thoughoften\\nonly to the south-east, and some companies aremakingeffortsto\\nreunite research and production . This is particularly trueofnon\\xad\\nBritishcapitaland it is there, too, that higher levels ofmanagement\\nare to be found in peripheral regions(onceagainthe social\\ncharacter ofcapitalisall-important) .FromSilicon Valley comes\\na story which indicates thatthe process of cumulative causation\\nmight one day burnitself out. The competition forelectronics\\nengineers in thatarea is now so fierce thatsomecompanies are\\ndeliberately locating \\'their most important research and develop\\xad\\nmentprojects well away from Silicon Valley - where their top\\nengineers will be less likely to be tempted bycompetitors\\' (Kehoe,\\n1982). But overall, the signs are thatthedynamics inherent in the\\npresently-emerging spatialdivisionoflabourin the UK look set to\\nentrench thecountryinto a highly unequalgeography .\\nWhatkindofpolicyintervention might halt these trends,enablea\\nmore equal geographical future? One thing which is fascinating\\naboutthe period since the early sixties is the variety ofpolitical 292SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nstrategies which have been adopted. A couple ofversionsofsocial\\ndemocracy and a bold attempt to break outof the mould in a\\nrightwards direction .Noneofthem have solved the problems ofthe\\neconomy, nor is it yet clear thatanyofthem have brokenthe\\npolitical log-jam. Whatisabundantly clear isthateachofthese\\nstrategies for social and economic reorganisation , eachattemptto\\n\\'dosomething aboutthe British economy\\' has not only, by not\\nfacing them, been undermined bystructural social and economic\\ncontradictions , each has also, as partand parcel ofthe same\\nprocess,produced different patterns of uneven development. There\\niscertainly along-term shiftunderway in the national spatial\\ndivisionoflabour,but the variouscomponents ofit have been\\npushed forward differentially and unevenly with each economic and\\npolitical conjuncture .Strategies oftechnocratic reforming moder\\xad\\nnisation, epitomised by the White Heat of Wilsonism, reproduced\\n\\'theoldregional problem\\' with a vengeance . The decline of\\nemployment in the old imperial bases oftheperipheral regions,\\nespecially coal, was at its fastest. But at the same time, this strategy,\\noperated in a period when the world economy was still relatively\\nbuoyant,produced also the fastest growthofthe new spatial\\nstructures ,ofdecentralisation ofproduction to lessurbanareas\\nand to\\'theregions\\'.Itwas,moreover , aneconomic strategy\\ncombined with an active regional policy and important growthin\\nlocalStateemployment. All this together looked for a moment\\nreally like renovation: newjobsfor the regions, convergence of\\nunemployment rates. In reality it was the emergence ofone aspect\\nofa new form ofgeographical inequality . In the mid-seventies a\\ncombination ofprevarication onbotheconomic and regional fronts\\nled to less dramatic changes in the old Development Areas. But in\\nthe more recent industrial heartlands and in the inner cities the\\ndecline of manufacturing washeralding new\\'problem areas\\'. With\\ntheadventofThatcherism the balance ofprocesses changed again.\\nThe lossofjobsin the old Development Areas was accelerated once\\nmore and this time not justin the old basic industries but also in\\nsomeofthosedecentralised as recently as a decade before. Norwas\\nthere any new wave ofdecentralisation to plug the gap, not even\\nnewjobsin the local State sectors.The emergence of thatelementof\\nthe newspatialdivisionoflabourseemed to have gone into reverse,\\nor at least to have slowed down. But otherelements ofchange\\ncontinued apace. Britain\\'s manufacturing role in the international\\neconomy continued itsdramatic decline,takingwith it wide, and The Reproduction ofInequality: A Question ofPolitics 293\\npreviously relatively prosperous ,areasofthecountry. Both\\npolitically andeconomically the room for manoeuvre for\\'doing\\nsomething abouttheregional problem\\' wasdramatically narrowed.\\nWhatall these contrasts show isthatthechanging formof\\'the\\nregional problem\\', andofspatialinequality moregenerally, is not\\ninevitable ,inexorable, oruniquely aquestion ofeconomics. Itis\\nalsopolitical. Inordertounderstand geographical shifts at any\\nparticular time it is necessary to understand theeconomic, andthe\\npolitical,characteristics oftheperiod.These three periodswith their\\ndifferent politicsandtheircontrasting economic backdrops and\\npressures, produced verydifferent movements in theindustrial and\\nsocialgeography ofthecountry. Theseoutcomes couldnot be read\\noffat this level from the stateof theeconomy .\\nBut on the otherhandandat adeeperlevel, allofthesepolitical\\nstrategies were themselves boundby theultimate constraint: the\\n.dominance .of\\'.capitalist relations ofproduction.\\nOneofthe main burdensofthisbookhas been to produce an\\ninterpretation ofspatialpatterns ofemployment in terms ofthe\\ngeographical organisation ofthesocialrelations ofcapitalist\\neconomic .activity. We have seen thatwhen the issue ofspatial\\nform isconsidered in·thisway.and not justas aquestion ofthe\\ngeographical distribution ofjobs, then even thenatureofthe\\nproblem changes. The issue ofexternal controlis not simply a\\nmatterofthegeography -ofownership, asmostcurrentarguments\\nimply. Any real solution would have to tacklealso the question of\\nthesociallocation ofcontrolandthedeeperorganisation of\\nproduction itself. As happened earlierthiscenturyin thenorth\\xad\\neastofEngland (seeChapter 5) and is to some extenthappening in\\nthenorth-west now(LloydandShutt, 1982), when a region\\nbecomes relatively unprofitable, capital- even\\'local\\'capital- will\\ndiversify its investments topastures new. It is true the growing size\\nandsectoral andgeographical spreadofindividual companies\\nincreases the flexibility oftheirinvestment. It is also true, there\\xad\\nfore,thattheexpansion ofmultiregional capital,andtherefore of\\nexternal control, will increase the problems for some regions - but\\nonly for those regions which are relatively unprofitable (Swales,\\n1979).

It is the samewith\\nthedifferential spatialdistribution ofoccupational groupsand\\nsocialstrata.Thenewspatialdivision oflabourdepends on a\\nparticular formoftechnolog y, one in whichsomedo all the\\nstrategic thinkwork andothersall theassembly orwhatever.

Fordecades now the battleoverlabourism, and to\\nsome extent over tradeunion power itself, has been fought in and\\noverparticular regions.Therecomposition ofnational social\\nstructure could not have taken place without thegeographical\\nchanges we have been documenting here. The formation of the\\ncharacteristics ofcertainclasses, and subgroups within classes, is\\nboundup with geographical form. The old heartofthelabour\\nmovement would not have been the same without geographical\\nconcentration, nor the shop stewards\\' movement inengineering \\xad\\nnor trades councils - withoutthe varied social infrastructure ofthe\\nbig cities. Todaycertainsocialstratahave their statusreinforced by\\nthe fact of their location.Thebattlesmay now be over new bases of\\nthe left - the big cities maybe. \\'Thinking geographically\\' ispartof\\nthinking aboutsociety more generally, and recognition andunder\\xad\\nstanding ofgeographical variation is essential for any strategyof\\nnational political change. 8\\nReflections on Debates over a Decade\\n8.1 Themes\\nTheargument thus far has been a complex one. Three sets of\\ninterlocking empirical investigations have been developed from the\\nopening theoretical chapters:aroundtheformation andnatureof\\ncertainspatialstructures ofproduction ,aroundthedifferential\\nconstruction oflocal areas and the consequently distinctive ways\\nin which they were affected by certainpartsof some of those spatial\\nstructures, andaroundhow at the national level these processes\\nwere themselves embedded in acontextwhere the articulation\\nbetween politics and economic geography exhibited clear changes\\nfrom one period to the next. Through allofthesechapters has run a\\ncomplexofthemes:aboutpolitics,aboutthenatureofexplanation,\\nabouttherelationbetween the social and the spatial,and so forth.\\nPrecisely because ofthis necessary complexity in the interweaving\\nofthe themes in the empirical analyses it is appropriate now to\\ndisentangle them again and to recapitulate them asseparatestrands\\nofargument. This also enables a return,thoughat a more abstract\\nlevel, to some ofthetheoretical argument first raised in the earlier\\nchapters ofthe book.\\nMoreover, since the publication of the first editionofSpatial\\nDivisions ofLabour, debateon anumber ofthese issues has\\nblossomed further.There has been controversy provoked by the\\nbookitself;therehavebeenbothappreciative reviews and\\ncontestatory critiques which took issue with some of the proposi\\xad\\ntionsadvanced, and there have been constructively critical evalua\\xad\\ntions and uses ofthematerial and ideas which have taken further\\nthe germs ofthoughts putforwardin thebook. It is time, therefore,\\nfor some assessment oftheposition. I have not made any attempt\\nto reply to, or consider in detail, all the articles referenced. That\\nwould have been an impossible task! Rather,I haveorganised my\\nthoughts aroundfourpersistent fociofdebate: the first two ofthese\\nconcerntherelationship ofthe book to Marxism and to the analysis\\n296 Reflections on Debates over a Decade 297\\nofcapitalism, andtheapproach toexplanation which I try to\\ndevelop.Bothofthese facets ofthebookprovoked considerable\\nfurorewhen it was first published .

In fact,\\nit wasintended asneitheracaricature norarejection ofeverything\\nMarxist, andstill less ofAlthusserian Marxism (seeSocietyand\\nSpace,1987). But it does insist on exploring someofthecomplex\\xad\\nities -andproblems -ofthistroubled field. It is therefore perhaps\\nhelpful to consider this issue at greaterlength.\\nCapitalism\\nThearguments advanced in thisbookconcern themechanisms ofa\\nspecifically capitalist economy andsociety.Itisimportant to be 298 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\npreciseaboutwhat this statement means.Thereare anumberof\\nways in which it is true.First,thecentralfocusofempirical\\nattention is on those aspects oftheinternational economy, on a\\nparticular national economy , and on industrial sectorsand indivi\\xad\\ndualcompanies whichfunction within a framework ofprivate\\ncapitalist accumulation .Theeconomic mechanisms /causalpro\\xad\\ncesses on which attention istrainedare those ofprivateaccumula\\xad\\ntion forprofit.Thereare some exceptions to this,mostparticularly\\ntheexamination atvariouspointsin thebookof sectors which in\\ntheUnitedKingdom have been organised throughtheState.Chief\\namongthese are the majornationalised industries (in the case of this\\nbookparticularly thecoal-mining industry) and the hugely impor\\xad\\ntantemployment sectorsofthe welfare state(particularly health,\\neducation , andotherlocalgovernment employment). Thesesectors\\nhave been and still are ofimmense significance in theshifting\\nnational urbanandregional geography. The only otherform of\\nproduction which is directly considered and which lies outsidethe\\nnormalspecification of\\'purelycapitalist\\' isthatofthepetty\\nbourgeoisie. Here, however, whatis really at issue is a form of\\nproduction which tends towardscertainpetty-bourgeois traits(and\\nwherethatend-concept istherefore useful in its characterisation)\\nbutwhich is clearly set within, and influenced by, asurrounding\\neconomy which is capitalist.\\nSecond, whatthis focus on capitalist relations means is that\\ncertainaspectsbothofthetheoretical framework andofthe\\nempirical analyses arenotsimplygeneralisable toother, non\\xad\\ncapitalist, societies. This is true, for instance, oftheframework of\\nclassrelations laid out in Chapter2 (seeespecially Section 2.3 Social\\nstructures andcapitalist relations ofproduction) and it is true ofthe\\nempirical analyses ofthemajority oftheindustrial sectors. The\\nmechanisms at work, in one form or another, are those ofprivate\\ncapitalist accumulation. Ironically , this isperhapsclearest,certainly\\nmostexplicit, in those sections ofthebookwhere direct comparison\\nis made with partsof theeconomy whichfunction according to\\notherprinciples - thediscussion inChapter4 (especially Section 4.4\\nOtherconsumer services: privatecapitalandtheState)isprobably\\nthe most extended example - where the contrast inmechanisms is\\nclearlyshownalso to involve acontrast ininherent causal\\ntendencies (which is not, ofcourse,to saythattheoutcomes will\\nnecessarily be different! - see below) - indeed in the public sector\\nthese will dependuponthedominant politics. The reasonfor Reflections on Debates over a Decade 299\\nmakingthispointis inorderto be clear aboutthe limits to the\\nrange of applicability oftheanalyses inprevious chapters, and to\\nstress the conceptual approach. However, to say thatthese are\\nspecifically capitalist relations does not mean thatnoneoftheir\\ncharacteristics will ever arise as an issue in otherformsofsocial\\norganisation of theeconomy. Questions ofhierarchy, ofspecialisa\\xad\\ntion and oftherelations between specialisms, andofcoordination,\\nand the social problems which these pose, are by no meansconfined\\nto societies which we define as capitalist.\\nHowever, if theparticular mechanisms studiedare specifically\\ncapitalist, andtheiranalysis thus not simply transferable toother\\nformsofeconomic relations, it is none the less truethatthe wider\\nframework, thebroadest arguments which guide the very form of\\nthese analyses, aregeneralisable. Thus,thearguments forthinking\\nin terms of relations, for thecentralanalytical importance ofthe\\nnotionofthe complex structuring ofdefinitions andofcausality\\n(theconceptofarticulation), and for the mutualconstitution ofthe\\nsocial and the spatial,all these are generalisable propositions which\\ncould indeed be used in an analysisof societies very different in the\\nfunctioning oftheir\\'economies \\' (if indeed such a concept were\\napplicable) from the UnitedKingdom in the late twentieth century.\\nAnexampleoftheapplication oftheframework to asocietywhich\\niscomposed ofbothcapitalist and\\'pre-capitalist\\' elements and\\nlayers can be found in Fahey(1989).\\nThereis athirdway,moreover, in which SpatialDivisions of\\nLabourisaboutcapitalist socialrelations. This isthatit isabouta\\nsocietywhich it specifies as characterised bycapitalist forms.\\nMoreover it is this aspectof the society which is the focus ofthe\\nempirical attention. Theprecision of thisformulation isagain\\nimportant. To saythata society is capitalist isnotto saythatit\\nisnototherthings as well, such as racist, homophobic, sexist. UK\\nsociety is indeed characterised by all of these things. The focus of\\nthebook,however, is on the specifically capitalist-economic\\nmechanisms withinthatsociety.Moreover, this setofmechanisms\\n(this fact of its being capitalist) is taken to be significant. Thus:\\'The\\nfactthattheUnitedKingdom is acapitalist societymeansthatthe\\nbroadformsofits social organisation are built aroundthe class\\nrelations ofcapitalist production ... This is essential to allthat\\nfollows.Itgoverns thestructure ofsociety, the organisation of\\nproduction andmany of the unquestioned assumptions ofdaily life.\\n\"Itis taken for granted, \\'in the way things work\\', thatprofitshould 300 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nbe thenormalyardstick ofinvestment in mostareasofactivity:that\\nthe living standards ofthepropertyless majority shouldbe set\\nprimarily by the terms on which they sell or once sold their labour\\n. . .poweris to be found more in uneventful routinethanin\\nconscious and active exercise of will\" (Chapter 2, p. 16). This is a\\nstrongstatement; thatclass and the fact ofitscapitalist natureis a\\ncentralstructuring principle in the characterisation of UK society.\\nMoreover Icontinue to agree with thatstatement today,although I\\nmightformulate itratherdifferently: for while to talk ofbroad\\nforms of social organisation being built aroundthe class relations\\nanddivisions of labourofcapitalist production is, I believe, correct,\\ntodesignate them as thebroadforms is to accept certain(hidden)\\nassumptions aboutwhich I might now be more circumspect. Chief\\namongst these isthatthe term \\'broadformsofsocialorganisation\\'\\nrefers to thatnexusofsocial divisions which defines itself in terms\\nof income /relation to\\'theeconorny \\'rrelation to paid work. This,\\nhowever, is notthe only way in which society is structured . If, for\\ninstance, such forms ofsocialorganisation were to refer to the\\nreproduction ofthe species or to certainotheraspectsofsocial\\ninteraction overwhelmingly predominant in alleconomic classes,\\nthen we might argue thatthey were built aroundthestructure of\\nheterosexist andpatriarchal definitions of, anddistributions of\\npeople into, categories calledmasculine and feminine.\\nHowever, to returnto theframework of the book: although it\\narguesthatclass and capitalist relations arecentralstructuring\\nfeatures of the society in question, it also states thatthere ismoreto\\nthatsocietythancapitalism. Thus,on the page following the\\nquotation above,andconcluding the same section,it ispromised\\nofthe analysis that\\'Thereis a stress on the interconnections\\nbetween \"theeconomic\" andotherareasoflife, aconcern about\\nhow to use \"lawsof thecapitalist modeofproduction\" inempirical\\nanalysis, and an emphasis on the fact thatacapitalist society is far\\nmorethanthecapitalist mode of production\\' .\\nLatersections ofthischapter will deal with someofthe\\nimplications ofthisstatement. The rest ofthis section, however,\\nwill stay with the question ofcapitalism .Inwhatsense does the\\nanalysis in the bookinsist on this? - for, as has been noted,it has\\nbeen seen by some as deserting the cause of, certainly theoretical,\\nMarxism .One\\'sopinion on thismatter, as so often, depends on\\nwhat one means. Reflections on Debates over a Decade 301\\nStructures, laws and tendencies\\nThebroad,framing structure softheanalysis in thisbookare\\nconceptualised , as has alreadybeen said, as specifically capitalist.\\nThus, to take perhapsthe most obviousexample, theframework for\\ntheconceptualisation ofclass,andforthedefinition ofand\\ndistinctionbetween different places within the class structure , is\\nrelevant specifically and only to a capitalist-dominated economic\\nstructure . It would not be relevantto adominantly socialistsociety,\\nnor does it have any meaning inrelationtofeudalism. And it is not\\nsimplytransferable to ananalysisofthe forms ofsociety which until\\nrecently were dominant ineasternEurope.Chapter 2 (Section 2.3\\nSocialstructures andcapitalist relations ofproduction : A frame\\xad\\nwork, pp. 3(}-8)setsoutthe basic outlinesofthisapproach, based\\nonWright\\'s work in the mid-seventies. Wright\\'s formaltriangleis\\npresented, andrecommended as a way of establishing, andthus\\nholdingup toexploration, twoimportant conceptual linkages. The\\nfirst, between specific functions within a capitalist society at any\\npointin time and the social groupswhich at thattimeperformthose\\nfunctions , issubsequently to be the basis for a reformulated analysis\\nofthegeography ofemployment as thegeography offunctions and\\nof the social relations whichconstitute thosefunctions. The second\\nlink which the framework enablesis between class structure and\\nlong-term processes ofcapitalist development (p.31).Inother\\nwords,boththe internal conceptualisation ofanyindividual place\\nwithin the class structure andthecharacterisation ofitsbroad\\ndelineament anddevelopment is firmly historico-materialisl.\\nAll of this is fairly basic, andperhaps evenmundane . But it is\\nimportant toestablish as aprecursor to a second issue. Forthis is\\nindeed only a framework; it is a tool which can be used in analysis.\\nBut itcannotbelaid upon a set ofempirical facts in the hopethatthe\\nreal world will \\'fit\\', it is notstaticbut precisely a flexible framework\\nby means ofwhichmovement andchangecan beanalysed; and such\\nmovement andchangecannotbeassumed to have any predetermined\\ndirection. Thereisa whole host of issueshere. The sectioninChapter\\n2deals for example with some ofthepotential sourcesofvariation \\xad\\ngenerated frombothwithin and without theformalframework \\xad\\nwhich might be found in the class structure ofany specific capitalist\\nsociety. The argument which is significant at thispoint,however, is\\nthatwhilebroadstructures ofacapitalist society are recognised, and 302SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nwhile these broadstructures areconceptualised ashavingtendencies\\ntodevelop incertainways,and(notthe same thing) as having\\nhistorically developed inparticular directions, thereisalsoa\\nthorough-going rejection ofdeterministic laws,predetermined out\\xad\\ncomes or ineluctable stagesofhistory.\\nThesepointsmay be spelled outindividually. Toconceptualise\\nphenomena ascapitalist is also to recognise thatthere is an aspect\\nof things which may be systematically sodesignated .Moreover , the\\nphenomena socharacterised in theanalysis hereincludebroad\\nstructures ofsociety (such as class structure). Thereis thus no\\nrestriction towhatissometimes called\\'local\\'theory.Withinall\\narguments ofthis kind lurks in recent years the contested issue of\\nmetanarratives. Thecritiqueof metanarratives has been a central\\npartof thepostmodern questioning ofcertainformsofmodernist\\ntheorising, andit isperhaps worthpausing for amoment to\\nconsider its relevance here. As ever in debates in thisareathe\\nterms are slipperyandhalftheproblem isdefinition; so it will help\\nto focus down.Oneofthemostthorough-going andwidely\\nreferenced critiques ofmetanarrative was made by Jean-Francois\\nLyotard. ForLyotard (1984), the term metanarrative has two sides.\\nOn the one handit refers to totalising philosophies ofhistory: big\\nstorieswhich (in the end) account foreverything andwhich have a\\ndegreeofimmanent inexorability in theirunfolding . He would see\\nthisapproach ascharacteris ing theEnlightenment confidence in the\\nprogress ofreasonandfreedom andMarxism\\'s attachment , in\\nmanyof its forms, to a marchofclassconflictwhich is definitely\\nseen, over the long term, as going forward. On theotherhandthe\\nterm refers to discourses whichclaimaprivileged status,by\\nclaiming to have access to a truththrough whichotherdiscourses\\ncan beevaluated (while they themselves assertatranshistorical \\xad\\nandtransgeographical - validity). The position arguedinSpatial\\nDivisions ofLaboursharesmuchofthiswariness ofmetanarrative\\ndefinedin this way. Thereare two things which are of particular\\nimportance inrelation to thediscussion at thispoint.First, the\\nargument here rejects a view which positsasingle/most funda\\xad\\nmental/uniquely privileged axis ofexplanation inrelationto which\\nfoundation all societal changecanultimately be explained andin\\ncomparison with which othercausalstructures are subsidiary. The\\ncrucialpointhere for me is thatno onecausalstructure , orstory\\xad\\nline,shouldbetakento befoundational in the sense ofbeing at the\\nrootof everything . In specific relationto thearenaofdiscussion of Reflections on Debates over a Decade 303\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,while class is one ofthecentralfociof\\nattention itcannotbeassumed to be, in any given situation, the\\nmostfundamental axisofsocialrelations.Second, moreover, the\\napproach adopted here rejects any versionofgrandnarrative\\nwhich, implicitly or explicitly, entailstheunfolding ofastory\\nwhosecourseisalreadyknown. Both these issues will be taken\\nup again in otherpartsofthischapter. Forthemoment it is\\nimportant topursuethe logic (and sometimes non-sequiturs) ofthis\\nargument.\\nForrejecting this version ofgrandnarratives, andinthatmanner\\naccepting someofthecritiques ofmodernist formulations made by\\npostmodernists, is toaddresssomequiteprecise issues. Itdoesnot\\nnecessarily imply rushingoffto theotherendofsomepostulated\\nspectrum andinsisting thatthe only thing thatis possible is the\\ninvestigation ofthe local and the discrete. \\'Meta\\',in themeaning of\\nmetanarrative outlined above, has adefiniteandparticular mean\\xad\\ning: it does not justmean big. It is in partLyotard\\'s own writings\\nwhich have generated confusion here.Thus,thedefinition of\\'local\\'\\nis even more problematic thanthatof\\'meta\\'.Certainly it does not\\nhave any necessary connection to thegeographical useofthe term\\n(see Massey, 1991). Whatit seems primarily to beinvoking is an\\ninsistence on a lack ofconnectedness in anybroad,wide-ranging\\nsense. The \\'local\\' refers to a conceptually relatively discrete set of\\nsocialrelations,practices, institutions, and so forth. Furthermore ,\\nthatnotionoflocalness finds no placeinanapproach to\\nconceptualisation such asthatadvocated here which insists on the\\ncomplex interrelation of things. Connection, as well as differentia\\xad\\ntion,arewhatit is all about.Indeed, as will be seen later,\\nconnection isarguedto be an important partoftheconstitution\\nofdifferentiation. Lyotard, however, does introduce his ownnotion\\nofconnection, through his ideaof\\'the social bond\\'.But, at the\\nsame time, he insists thatthepractices which in some sense he calls\\nuponto hold society together are so varied andsorestricted in their\\nscope(theirpervasiveness within society) thatno general categories\\nsuch asgender,race or class are validly usable. Thereis, however, a\\ncrucial leap here from a rejection ofparticular practices/social\\nrelations astotalising to the rejection ofthenotionofanybroad\\nstructures (such as those pertaining to class or gender,andtherefore\\nno possibility of a critiqueofthem atthatlevel) at all.\\nItis not necessary, havingrejectedmetanarratives , to reject any\\nnotionofbroad(butnon-totalising) structures ,mostespecially if at 304SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe same time their multiplicity andcomplexity is recognised. This\\npointis wellarguedfrom a feminist perspective by Fraserand\\nNicholson (1988) in theirunravelling ofLyotard\\'s postmodernism .\\nAnd indeed, as they demonstrate, Lyotard himself has resortin\\npracticein his analysis of \\'society\\'to farbroaderstructures than his\\nmoreanalytically prescriptive mode would seem to warrant: his\\ninvocation ofapparently widespread structures andpractices of\\ninstrumental reason,and hiscritiqueofsuchstructures, as wellas, I\\nwould add, the broadperiodisation on which the analysis rests, are\\nprecisely cases in point.\\nThus,SpatialDivisions ofLabourrejectsmetanarratives in the\\nmeaning attributed above but it does not therefore adoptaposition\\nwhich restricts itself only to local structures; broadstructures, but\\nwhich are assumed to be multiple, non-totalising andwithoutpre\\xad\\ngivennarratives areacceptable , indeed necessary to the approach.\\nTherecognition ofsuchbroadstructures is not the same as the\\ncommitment to, oradoption of, ametanarrative viewofhistory.\\nNoneofthestructures which are identified need be assumed to have\\nanyinexorability in their unfolding. And in the analysis here it is\\nresolutely assumed thatthey do not;outcomes arealways\\nuncertain ,history- andgeography - have to be made.\\nItis, however, this commitment againstdeterminism which\\nprompted some discussion aboutthestatusof\\'theory\\'. A rejection\\nofthis criticism involves, perhaps, both a lesser commitment on my\\npartto tying everything down,hammering it into place, so that\\nthere is an overarching \\'order\\'in which I know where everything is\\n(for Idon\\'tand never can) and a disputeover what it is which\\nshouldgo by the name \\'theory\\'.Forme, this term most usefully\\nrelates to a process ofrigorous conceptualisation, itselfdrawing on\\npreviously-achieved understandings ofthephenomena inquestion,\\nand which in turn will involve the identification ofpotential causal\\nstructures. Itdoes not imply propositions aboutnecessary empirical\\noutcomes. Thereasoning behind this formulation will beelaborated\\nlater, in the section on Explanation (8.3).Forthemoment it is\\nstatedsimply as a presupposition ofmy analysis.\\nThus, in the discussion ofclassstructure, each of the sides of\\nWright\\'s triangle is related to the development oflong-term changes\\nwithin classically capitalist-dominated societies. The dimension\\nbetween bourgeoisie andworking class reflects the long historical\\nprocessoftheseparation ofeconomic ownership from possession Reflections on Debates over a Decade 305\\nand the development ofcomplex hierarchies within each ofthese\\nmajorfunctions (p. 35). The dimension between proletariat and\\npettybourgeoisie reflects\\'thelong process of removalofimmediate\\njobcontrolfrom direct producers\\' (p. 36).Thereare twopointsto\\nnote here. First, the references here to long-term developments are\\nreferences to actualhistorical changes - changes withincapitalist\\nsocieties which are generally recognised to have happened. They are\\nnot references to necessary immanent logics. Second, where the\\ncausesofthesehistorical changesare identified as lying within the\\nstructure ofcapitalist relations it is none the less still maintained\\nthat such causal powers do not necessarily result in a particular\\noutcome. Thus,on thedimension between bourgeoisie and petty\\nbourgeoisie . . .\\'onceagain there is a spectrum , reflecting boththe\\ndying-out ofself-employment inindustries where fully capitalist\\nrelations ofproduction areestablished and thecontinual regrowth\\nofself-employment inotherpartsoftheeconomy \\' (p. 37).\\nInotherwords, and once again to quotemyself \\'The framework,\\ntherefore, represents not astatictypology, ready to be fitted on to a\\npiece of the real world, but a set ofsocial processes within which\\nthere isconstanttensionand behind which lie the conflicts ofa\\ncapitalist society\\'(p. 37). The aim is conceptualisation andunder\\xad\\nstanding, not \\'prediction\\' ofpre-determined outcomes.\\nOne way in which this form of\\'prediction \\'oftentakes place in\\nsocial science analysis is retrospectively, with reference to things\\nwhich have alreadyhappened .Thuscurrentorhistorical changes,\\nwhich may in themselves be empirically undisputed, aresometimes\\ninterpreted inrelation to causal processes immanent incapitalist\\nrelations and - and this is the step in the procedure which is being\\nobjected-to here- asnecessarily produced bythosecausal\\nprocesses. This procedure occurs for instance in some (not all)\\nversions oftheFordism --+post-Fordism/neo-Fordisrn /flexible\\naccumulation sequence which has in recent years been identified\\nincapitalist production and(sometimes) inwidercapitalist\\nrelations.Thus,the endofan era(Fordism) isidentified empiri\\xad\\ncally, the opening of a new one is specified, and even thoughwe\\nnever foresaw beforehand eitherthebreakdown ofthe old or the\\ntransition to the new, the whole process isall too frequently, and all\\ntoo easily, interpreted aspartoftheinevitable working out of\\ntendencies inherent incapitalist society.Itisrarefor such a\\nformulation ofinevitability to be explicit, and in some analyses - 306SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsuch asthatofPiore and Sabel (1984)- it is clearly countered . But\\nin lesscareful analysis it isoften there implicitly.Things are this way\\nso they had to be this way.\\nThisformulation ofchange ifonlyimplicitly intermsof\\ninevitable sequences is rejected in the analysis put forward in this\\nbook.Thus, threedifferent types ofspatialstructure ofproduction\\nareidentified (single-region, cloning, andpart-process) .Moreover ,\\nit is also arguedthateachofthesehas been ofparticular\\nsignificance at different periodsin thehistoryofcapitalist relations\\nin the United Kingdom . However, the logic here is thatthis is why\\nthese three broadtypes have been selected for analysis and to serve\\nasexemplars (more on this later). Itisnotthatthey are three\\nnecessary stages which issue inexorably the oneintotheother(see\\nSection 3.2 Spatialstructures ofcapitalist production :Conceptua\\xad\\nlising the spatialorganisation ofproduction). Thusit ispointedout\\nthatthis is\\'notastatictaxonomy ofspatialstructures\\'...andthat\\nthe\\'emergence ofparticular kindsofspatialstructure willdepend\\non the level ofdevelopment ofdifferent aspectsoftherelations of\\nproduction\\' (p.77).However, it is also stressed boththatthe\\nemergence ofparticular conditions is only an enabling development\\n(it does not necessitate any specific effect) and thatpersistent\\nempirical movements , even in quite opposite directions , can also\\noftenbe identified (see pp. 77-9).Noneofthis is to argue thatin the\\nsocial sciences we cannotattemptto foresee directions ofchange;\\nthewholeaimofmuchofsuchworkisprecisely to try to\\nunderstand inorderto bebetterprepared. But thehistorywhich\\nis to come cannotbe forecast on the basis oftheworking outofa\\ndeterminate logic, a single logical principle.\\nThus,aftertheoutlineofthe basic class framework inChapter 2,\\nthreeReflections arepresented . Thesecondofthese precisely\\nconcerns this issue, and it takes as its majorexample the thesis of\\nanincreasing spatialcentralisation ofeconomies undercapitalism.\\nAll the elements ofthisargument arepresentthere.Explanation of\\nanempirical phenomenon cannotbeadequately established merely\\nbyrecourse to apostulated law orimmanent tendency . This is not\\nto saythatimmanent tendencies (in another terminology ,causal\\npowers) do notexist; they do and they are important to identify.\\nBut they cannotbeidentified by\\'observation ofactualempirical\\ntendencies followed byattempts tore-readthem as logically\\nnecessary outcomes ofapurecapitalist modeofproduction \\'\\n(p. 47).Thecase here is particularly poignant, for it refers to \\'the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 307\\nincreasing necessity for Stateprovision ofthe general conditions of\\nproduction andreproduction\\' (p. 47). Nothing moreclearly\\nillustrates thedangersofseeingcurrentdevelopments aslong-term\\nhistorical necessity than all the many \\'theorisations\\' in this way in\\nthe 1970s ofthe inevitability ofincreasing Stateintervention .\\nMoreover, thetendencies/causal powers which may be identified\\nare not \\'laws\\' in the sense ofnecessarily resulting in specific\\noutcomes. Thus \\'even had some general logical spatialtendencies\\nof a\"capitalist modeofproduction\" beenestablished, they would\\nnot in themselves be an explanation of theenormously complex\\ngeographical historyofactualcapitalist societies\\' (p. 48). Such a\\ncomplexity can only be coped with through arecognition ofthe\\nequal complexity ofcausalstructures. It is this issue which is taken\\nup in Section 8.3, Explanation, below.\\nFlowsofvalue and the analysis ofclass relations\\nThephenomena and the causalprocesses which figure in the\\npreceding chapters areconceptualised in terms ofclass, and in\\nmore general terms social, relations and not in terms of value.\\nThis, I have come increasingly to believe, is an important distinc\\xad\\ntion. Value analysis and class analysis are ofcourse not mutually\\nexclusive approaches; they are indeed clearly related. And value\\nitself, as isoft repeated, is a social relation. However, they do often\\nexist uneasily side by side in empirical analysis. Moreover it seems\\nto me to make an important difference to the whole tenorof an\\nanalysis, which of the two is adoptedas the main entry-point. This\\nis quiteapartfrom the byzantine entanglements into which the \\'law\\nofvalue\\' has fallen and which make it, in my view, unusable in any\\nempirical economic calculus. This is not to say thatthe concept of\\nvalue is not useful for thinking throughthebroadstructures ofthe\\neconomy and for forming the absolutely necessary basis for some\\ncentralconcepts -exploitation , forinstance. Butthatis quite\\ndifferent from the, in my view vain, attempts to use it as a basis\\nfor empirical economic calculation - thefrequent references in some\\nliterature to things such as \\'the organiccomposition ofcapital\\',for\\ninstance, often being in fact references to capitalintensity measured\\nin terms ofprice. However besides all these technical objections it\\nseems to me thatthere are also important implications for the\\nnatureofanalysis which arise from takingclassratherthanflowsof\\nvalue or even ofcapitalas the initial frame. 308SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nPerhaps most obviously, class interests as perceived by the\\nmembers of any class are not necessarily the same as economic\\ninterests and particularly not necessarily the same as shortor\\nmedium-term economic interests. Moreover class interests may\\noverride immediate economic interests, or may hold the key to\\nunderstanding why long-term ratherthanshort-term economic\\nadvantage proved to be decisive as a basis for action. There are\\nmany examples of this in foregoing chapters. At a broadlevelthere\\nis Gamble\\'s analysis of thatstrong strain in British Conservatism\\n\\'forwhich the maintenance of social power and relatively stable\\nclassrelations has been of far greaterimportance thanany\\nparticular \"bourgeois\" economic ideology, such as that ofthe free\\nplay of market forces\\' (p. 44). There are the frequent analyses of\\ntypes of capital - maybe old-fashioned, small or middling-sized \\xad\\nwhere\\'accumulate, accumulate\\' is certainly not the name of the\\ngame, where even the smallest positive rate ofprofit is an enabling\\ncondition for being what one primarily is, a maker of shirts for\\ninstance. The example of the woollen-textile industry (see Chap\\xad\\nter 6, pp. 268 passim),is a case in point where there was neither the\\nwill to maximise profits nor the willingness to withdraw from\\nproduction justbecause profits failed. Or again, there were the\\nanxiousintrospections of theConfederation ofBritishIndustry in\\nthetempestuous earlyyearsofMrsThatcher\\'s rule:After\\n\\'numerous boardroom battles... most companies retained their\\nlonger-term political and class loyalties above more immediate\\neconomic interests\\' (p. 258). An analysis which thoughtin terms\\nof categories defined only by the economic, or which expected\\nactions to be simply determined by the economic or, even more, by\\nvalue, could not accountfor such apparently anomalous formsof\\nbehaviour .\\nOne implication of this is that more thoughtneeds to be given to\\nthe way in which we characterise capital.Although \\'industry\\' is the\\nfocusofso much analysis - the central object of attention in\\nindustrial geography - it still seems to me thatremarkably little\\nwork has been done on this issue. It is for this reason thatan\\nattemptto get to grips with the question is presented right at the\\nbeginning of this book (Section 2.2, Characterising capital). For\\nwhat is clear throughout all thesubsequent analyses is thatcapital\\nis divided in ways far more complex (and including non-economic)\\nthan the simple criteria which are usually deployed in industrial\\nstudies (sector, size, place in the economy). In any given actual Reflections on Debates over a Decade 309\\nsocietycapitalisdifferentiated also by such thingsas social\\ncharacter, temperament , regional history. Moreover , as the ana\\xad\\nlysesthroughout thebook, andperhaps particularly those in\\nChapter 6, try to show, these differences are of real importance\\nbothto anyunderstanding ofthebehaviour ofparticular partsof\\nthe economy (how they respond to given economic pressures, for\\ninstance) and to analysis ofthe economy as a whole and ofits\\ngeography. The usual categories ofeconomic geography are simply\\nnot good enough; what is needed isan analysis ofthe class structure\\nofcapital.\\nBehind these points,ofcourse, liesa broaderargument: thatit is\\nimpossible simply to separate-off \\'theeconomic\\' from the political,\\nculturaland ideological aspects of society. IThe first ofthe three\\nReflections referred to above, and which follow the laying outofthe\\nclassframework, concerns this issue. Notonly are \\'politics and\\nideology . . . not to beinterpreted as simple reflections ofthe\\neconomic\\' but\\'politicsand ideology are themselves important in\\ntheconstruction ofthe economic\\' (p. 43).\\nOne way in which this isclearly true is thateconomic phenomena\\nhave to be interpreted. They are not simply objective datato which\\nthere willbe a knee-jerk response.There isan emphasis on this need\\nfor, and importance of,interpretation throughout the book. Itis\\nthere in the analysis ofthe response ofdifferent kindsofcapitalto\\nparticulareconom icpressures; it isthereintheattempt to\\ncharacterise capital;it is there in the analysis ofthenational\\neconomy. Thus, on the last, the shift in the later seventies towards\\nmonetarism was inparta political shift in the analysisofthe\\neconomy ; itconcerned \\'the political formulation ofthe economic\\nsituation as being primarily aproblemofinflation\\' (pp. 255-6), for\\ninstance; it involved re-working thedistinction between \\'productive \\'\\nand \\'non-productive\\' partsoftheeconomy (pp. 256 -7)- a\\nreinterpretation which had dramatic effects at bothmacro-econom\\xad\\nic and regional levels. \\'So it has not justbeenchanging economic\\ncircumstances which have been important but also changes in the\\nway in which economic pressures were filtered, moulded and\\ntranslated through theprevailing political and ideological climate\\'\\n(p. 227). The motifofall these arguments, and one which is\\nrepeated invarious formsthroughout thebook, isthat\\'the\\nrequirements ofaccumulation do not arrive raw at the factory gate\\'.\\nSuch a view leaves the analysis open,notjustto\\'politics,\\nideology . . .\\' etc. in their broadsenses but also to all those other 310SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nsocialrelations andaxesofsocialdifferentiation which in some\\nsense intheirorigins(though not intheirformation andreproduc \\xad\\ntion) are autonomous from\\'theeconomic\\' as it is usually defined\\nandyet which are thoroughly implicated in its form. The axis which\\ngetsmostattention in theanalyses here(though far lessthanit\\nshouldhave got) is genderrelations.TheElaborations (p. 39) to the\\nclassframework, forinstance, arguethat\\'ideologies ofraceand\\ngendercriss-cross thelabourmarket\\' andtalkintermsof\\n\\'ideologically determined labourmarkets\\'. The \\'industrial location\\ndecision\\', in otherwords,\\'isjustonemoment in a much wider\\neconomic, ideological andpolitical field\\' (p. 42).\\nAndfinally, all ofthesethingsleave open in the analysis a\\nnecessary space for agency, andforpolitics.Theopeningdiscussion\\ninChapter 2 triesbothto insist on this andtodifferentiate this\\nconceptofagency from the voluntaristic, free-floating-individual\\nvarietywhich is oftenset up in contradistinction tosupposed\\n\\'determinism\\' (see pp. 14-15).\\'Historical changecomesabout\\nthrough socialprocesses andsocialconflict... thisapproach\\nentailsa fardeeperrejection of\"determinism\" (p. 15; see also,\\nforinstance, p. 100). Thus,andharking backto theearlier\\ndiscussion onstructures andlaws, there is an insistence on the\\nfactthatnewspatialstructures comeabout,notthrough some\\nineluctable shifts,butthrough active social engagement (see, for\\nexamples, pp.82-90on anexample from the car industry; pp.289\\xad\\n91 onspatialstructures in general in the UK; andp. 293 on the\\nchanging formoftheregional problem) .\\'Theprocessby which one\\nuseofspace lays the preconditions foranotheris acomplex one,\\nanddepends on thepolitical andorganisational response ofthe\\nclassesandsocialgroupsinvolved\\' (p. 290); \\'Theevolution of\\ndifferent kindsofspatialstructure, theirestablishment, mainte\\xad\\nnanceandeventual collapse andchange, are not simply determined\\nby thecharacteristics ofthelabourprocess, therequirements of\\naccumulation , the stages ofthemodeofproduction, or even the\\ndemands ofcapital.Noneofthese things in themselves \"resultin\"\\nspecificspatialforms.Spatialstructures areestablished, reinforced ,\\ncombated andchanged through political andeconomicstrategies\\nandbattleson thepartofmanagers ,workers andpolitical\\nrepresentatives \\' . . . they are \\'theobjectofpolitical struggle\\'\\n(p. 82).

This changes thepolitical strategies forconfronting them.\\nAndhereagain,thereis noassumption abouttheoutcome ofany\\npolitics. Unlikeinmoredeterministic formulations ,capitalis here\\nnotassumed to get its own way, willy nilly.\\n8.3Explanation\\nIt was,however, Ithink, thiscommitment touncertainty ,along\\nwith theassociated resolve to recognise (andindeed to value) variety\\nanduniqueness, whichcausedmostconsternation when the book\\nfirstappeared .Thus,AlanWardecharacterised theapproach as\\n\\'highlyindeterminate\\' (1985, p. 199), andDavidHarvey, in the\\ncontextoftheSocietyand Space debate,wrote\\'Everysentence in\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabouris soladendownwith the rhetoricof 312SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ncontingency , place,andthe specificity ofhistory,thatthe whole\\nguidingthreadofMarxian argument isreducedto a set of echoes\\nandreverberations ofinertMarxian categories\\' (1987, p. 373). I\\nhopeI have begun to demonstrate in the last section thatI do not\\nseeMarxist categories as inert. However , even if, given the fore\\xad\\ngoingsection,Iwanttoarguethatthebookis focused on explicitly\\ncapitalist socialrelations andthatitsapproach is clearly relatedto\\nhistorical materialism, it isnonethe lessevidently the casethatthe\\nexplanatory stanceadopted towards itsobjectofstudyis quite\\nspecific, anddifferent from much ofwhatisfoundunderthe\\nheading \\'Marxism\\'. \\'Contingency\\' and\\'specificity \\'therefore war\\xad\\nrantsomebriefdirectattention.\\nOutcomes and causes\\nProbably themostevident index of the approach adopted is the\\nattitudetakento therelationbetween the causal properties ofthe\\ncentraltheorised objectsofstudyon the one handandactual\\noutcomes on theother.It isnotassumed thatthere is any necessary\\ndirectcorrespondence between the two.\\nThis works bothways. On the one hand,the existence ofa\\nnumberofapparently similaroutcomes doesnotnecessarily imply\\nthatall are due to the same causalstructure .Therearenumerous\\nexamples ofthisthroughout thebook.Perhapsthemostsignificant\\nintermsoftheoverallstoryline ,apparently similarregional\\nemployment structures may in fact bothbe the result ofdifferent\\nprocesses and have distinctsocio-political implications (see, for\\ninstance, pp.112-13and167-9).Thus,thelargeamount of\\ndecentralisation of\\'jobsforwomen\\' to the regions ofthenorth\\nand west in the late sixties cannotall beexplained in terms ofthe\\nsamecausalstructure .Acceptance ofthisargument immediately\\nproblematises the way into analysis. Forprobably oneofthemost\\nfrequent stimuli to research is therecognition ofapattern:thatis, a\\nregularity ofoutcomes. Indeed,RoyBhaskar, in spiteofhisother\\narguments , hassuggested theidentification ofanempirical\\nregularity as thestarting-point forinvestigations (Bhaskar, 1978,\\npp. 163-6). Theimpetus, if onlyintuitively , is to find outwhat\\ncauses the pattern.Now,as-a place to start,observed patterns are\\nasacceptable asanything else, but it is important toremember that\\naregularpatterndoes not in itself imply any necessary consistency\\nofcause: in otherwords,no single or systematic cause may lie Reflections on Debates over a Decade 313\\nbehind it. The implication is not that one shouldnotstartfrom\\npatternsofoutcomes, but that it is important not to foreclose the\\nimmense possibilities of causal structure byassuming asingularity\\nof cause. A furtherimplication of course is that there are also many\\notherplaces to startininvestigations : thepotentially symptomatic\\ncase-study (judged to be so on the basis ofunderstanding already\\narrived at) is one clear alternative.\\nOn theotherhand, to reverse the argument, the existence ofa\\ncausalproperty does not guarantee adeterminate outcome on any\\ngivenparticular occasion. Thus, Section 3.3 (Spatial structures of\\nproduction andgeographical inequality) analyses the sources of\\nspatialdifferentiation which are integral to each of the types of\\nspatialstructure underinvestigation . Two axes of these sources of\\ndifferentiation areidentified :thoseto do with interregional\\nrelations (the social relations between spatially separated partsof\\nthe overall relations of production), and those to do with social\\nstructures in the\\'recipient\\' locales. However, the following section\\n(3.4, The uniqueness of place) then goes on to arguethatthe actual\\nimplications of any spatial structure cannotbe deduced from these\\npropositions alone(although knowledge ofthem will be necessary).\\nInparticular, stress is laid on the need to understand the impact of\\nspatialstructures as resulting from their combination with the\\nexisting character oftheareainquestion.Different existing\\ncharacters, different causalcombinations, mayresultindistinctly\\ndifferent outcomes. At this pointthe example of car plantsis used;\\nlater, in Chapter 5, the bulk of the chapteris given over to the\\nextended analysis of precisely this kind of variation resulting from\\nthe\\'combination of layers\\'. Thus \\'it is fruitless to examine the real\\nworld for an empirically-generalised outcome inordertosubstanti\\xad\\nate some inherentlogic. The internal necessity of a spatial structure\\ndoes not get \"actedout\"in the real world in pure form. Whattakes\\nplace is the interrelation ofthe new spatialstructure with the\\naccumulated results of the old. The \"combination\" of layers, in\\notherwords, really does mean combination, with each side of the\\nprocess affecting the other\\'(p. 117).\\nThis insistence on the lack ofnecessary conjunction between\\noutcome and cause runs throughout the book. Thus, in Section 4.3\\n(Clothing and footwear) there isa reflection on the survival ofsmall\\nfirms in those sectors. As in electronics such firms continue to form\\nanimportant presence. Some of the reasons for this similar result in\\ntwo such different partsof the economy are shared - for instance 314SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthe lack of economies of scale in production. However, thatfact\\nitself is the result of highly contrasting processes (see pp. 149-52).\\nThis is an insignificant example,buriedwithinthe text but\\nnecessarily present because the broad principles of analysis laid\\nout in the early sections of the book must be put into practice\\nthroughout. Itis a small example, then, which should be seen as\\ncarrying out in practice and thereby emphasising a main theme,\\naboutthestructure of causality, which runs throughout the book\\nand which is manifested in a whole variety of different forms. It is\\noneofthe reasons for the complexity of the book (a pointremarked\\non byMarkusen, 1993).\\nIf, then \\'\\'\\'general laws\" are aboutcausation, not empirical\\ncorrelation\\' (p.116),their relation to empirical work is one of\\npossibility and, maybe, enablement ratherthan ofguarantee . Thus,\\nto give one example, \\'scientific management andFordism only\\nmake spatial separation ofcontrolandproduction possible. They\\ndo not, outside of particular circumstances, determine that it will\\nhappen\\'(p.25).There may be whole ranges of sets ofcircumstances\\nwhere scientific management andFordism are associated with the\\nspatialseparation ofproduction andcontrol, but there may also be\\nothers in which the possibility of geographical separation is not\\nrealised.\\nThis,however, raisesissuesabouttheevaluation ofany\\ninterpretation of causal structure. On what grounds, and to what\\nextent, can it be thoughtto be valid, sound, worthy of adoption? (I\\ndo not raise the terms \\'proofor\\'testing\\', since these seem to imply\\naneither/or, true/false dichotomy which is unwarranted.)\\nAs Saunders (1981)has argued, a formulation like the one above\\ncan make it impossible to evaluate empirically the usefulness ofthe\\nstatement \\'scientific management andFordism makespatial\\nseparation possible\\' if in any actualcase the result may be\\nseparation or notseparation, and if those very different outcomes\\ncan always beaccounted for by resort to the appropriate balance of\\ncircumstances acting for and against such separation .Itisnecessary\\nto push further, therefore. To begin with, ofcourse, the evaluation\\nofhypotheses aboutcausalstructures doesnotonly involve\\nempirical methods; it also importantly involves a constantly self\\xad\\nquestioning theoretical rigour. Moreover, and this point is perhaps\\nonly rarely made, the theoretical scepticism and the empirical\\nevaluation are not (or should not be) totally separate activities\\n(first let\\'s see if it\\'s internally consistent then let\\'s test it against the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 315\\ndata).The two can with great profitbetotallyinvolved with each\\nother,constantly provoking questions, throwing upproblems, the\\none for the other. This is one reasonwhy my own preference is\\noftento wrestle with theoretical problems in thelaboratory ofan\\nempirical case,ratherthansimply \\'in the abstract\\', as they say.\\nBut, given this, whatis thenatureoftheempirical evaluation?\\nFromtheargument aboveit would seem thatlarge-scale correla\\xad\\ntion-type exercises would not be the mosthelpful, since they give so\\nlittle access to causalstructures. At theotherendofthespectrum,\\nempirical testing in the regulated environment of a closed system is\\nnot possible in the kinds ofquestions at issue here. Itis, however,\\npossible to explorethepotential validityofhypotheses aboutcausal\\nstructures through thein-depth examination ofarangeof cases, in\\nwhich for instance andtoreturnto theaboveexample spatial\\nseparation didoccurin some and in othersnot. In Saunders \\'\\nterminology, itshouldindeed be possible to come up with some\\xad\\nthingalongthe lines of \\'counterfactuals\\' .Itis, forinstance, possible\\nandimportant to askunderwhatcircumstances thepostulated\\ntendency toseparation maynotoccur. (Someexamples ofthissort\\nofreasoning occurin theprevious chapters, although there is no\\nattempt there at systematic evaluation.) Suchspecifications of\\ncircumstances will never be purecounterfactuals: they can never\\nbe precise. Forinevitably there will beothercontingencies in play\\nandalwaysaccountmustbetakenofthevagaries of,andthe effect\\nof,humanintervention . This means thattheinvestigation should\\nnotbetempted intolaw-statements aboutoutcomes . Butwhatis\\npossible is an accumulation ofevidence, for andagainst;evaluation\\nas agradualprocess.\\nArticulation/ thinking in terms ofrelations\\nWe are, then, firmly into the realm of\\'multicausality\\' andagain\\nthere are numerous examples throughthebookwhere it is necessary\\ntodrawuponwholeconstellations ofprocesses, specified in relation\\nto class, to technological level, to genderrelations, andwith the\\nsignificance ofthespatialorganisation ofeachofthese processes\\nunderlined . A small buttypicalexample occursin theanalysisof\\ncertainstrategies withinthefootwear industry (see pp. 162-3),\\nwhere a satisfactory explanation couldnotbearrivedatwithout\\ndrawing uponanalysis from all these different directions .Each 316SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nprocess is in itself theoretically analysable (\\'necessary \\' maybe, in the\\ntermsofrealism) and each in principle could be theorised in terms\\nof its causal powers at a very general level (andremembering that\\nsuch powers /tendencies are themselves only \\'enabling\\' ratherthan\\ndeterminate ofanyparticular outcome), but their intersection, the\\ntermsoftheirintersection, and its results, are contingent. Again this\\ndoes not mean thattheoutcomes are totally indeterminate, in the\\nsensethatnothingcan beanticipated - even in the case ofhuman\\nagency the potential coursesofactionarefrequently restricted\\n(people are boxed-in, there is only bounded indeterminancy) . It\\nsimply implies thatin principle the outcome needs specificinvestiga\\xad\\ntion.\\nThis, however, is to go beyond the usual meanings ofmulti\\xad\\ncausality, which is a very flaccid term. Whatare at issue here are\\ncausalstructures in which processes intersect to impactupon each\\nother,to influence /encourage/restrain /mouldtheoperation ofeach\\nother. It is this which I think of, in a general form, as articulation.\\nIn this kind ofapproach tocausality, causescannotsimply be\\naddedtogether, as incertainformsofmultiple regression analysis,\\ntoapproach withmounting excitement a \\'significant\\' levelof\\nexplanation . A case ofthis kind ofcausalthinking ispresented in\\nrelation to thecentralquestion, for the book,of theimpactof\\nregional policy. Chapter 6, in the section on \\'Modernisation\\' takes\\nup the issue (seeespecially p. 234 et seq.),arguingthat\\'notonly did\\ntheeconomic roleofregional policy change over time, its impact\\nalso varied between sectors. Most obviously, it was simply more\\nimportant in some sectors than othersas afactorinlocational\\nchange. But more thanthis, regional policy combined indifferent\\nways indifferent industries withotherdevelopments takingplace at\\nthetime.Thewayitactually operated wasalsodifferent\\'\\n(pp. 240-1; and see also p. 166).\\nFurther, withinsuchcausalstructures theremay be some\\nprocesses which in a given instance are more important than\\nothers(forinstance by having more impacton theoperation of\\notherprocesses thanvice versa, or by determining theconditions of\\noperation ofotherprocesses). However, the fact, degree and nature\\nofsuchdominance can only be established by empirical enquiry,\\nand it can change from case to case. Itis not valid - in this view of\\ncausality - toassumethat,to take the favourite example, in the end\\nit will always be class which is dominant /determinant. (See for\\ninstance thediscussion oftheproposed necessity forspatial Reflections on Debates over a Decade 317\\ncentralisation [especiall y pp.46-7],ortheconclusions to the\\ndiscussion ofcharacterising capital[pp.28-30].)\\nThatlastexample (characterising capital) makesclearthatthis\\nnotionofarticulation appliesnotonlytostructures ofexplanation\\nbutalso to the very conceptualisation ofempirical phenomena . This\\nis oneaspectofamoregeneralapproach which I have tried to\\nadvocate andtopursuein thisbookandwhich may be called\\n\\'thinking in termsofrelations\\' .Thus,\\'jobs\\'(particular formsof\\nemployment) areconceptualised asparticular moments withinthe\\noverallrelations ofproduction , asfunctions setwithinanddefined\\ninarticulation with the wider set ofsocialrelations. It is this\\napproach whichconverts anunderstanding ofaparticular geogra\\xad\\nphicaldistribution ofemployment frombeingsimply a patternof\\njobstobeingaresultant whichindicates theformofspatial\\norganisation oftherelations ofproduction whichholdsthosejobs\\ntogether andofwhich they are phenomena. Thisapproach ,ofre\\xad\\ninterpreting \\'objectsinspace\\'asproducts ofthespatialorganisation\\nofrelations is at the heartoftheapproach ofthebookandwill be\\naddressed againinSection 8.5. But another example ofthis\\napproach, andwhich plays a key role in the book,isthatof\\n\\'branchplants\\' (see for instance, pp.104-6).Hereit isarguedthat\\n\\'it isimportant to getawayfromdiscussions ofapparently simple\\n\"objects\", andtoconceptualise processes andrelations . . .The\\nnotionof\"branch plant\" is agoodexample...Whatisimportant\\nis... toconceptualise thedifferent rolesbranchplantscan play in\\ntermsofthedifferent spatialstructures in which they are embedded\\nandthedifferent largerprocesses andrelations which they reflect\\'\\n(p. 104). Thinking ofbranchplantsin this way, it is arguedandI\\nhopedemonstrated, enables us todelineate anumber ofquite\\ndistinct forms,withcontrasting tendencies intermsoftheir\\npotential effects on inter-area relations, local social structures ,\\nandtheopportunities forandconstraints ontradeunionnegotia\\xad\\ntors(p. 104).\\nAt thispointthereare some particular arguments to pick up\\nwhich have been raised by commentators on thisapproach .Thus,\\nAllanCochrane, in a very thought-provoking exploration ofthe\\nformsofexplanation adopted inSpatialDivisions ofLabour,\\nadvanced the idea thatwhatisproposed in thebookis a form of\\n\\'micro-structuralism\\' (Cochrane , 1987). Whathe implies by this\\nterm is a structure ofexplanation which is constantly mademore\\ncomplex through disaggregation intosmallerandsmaller taxo- 318SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nnomicgroupsto eachofwhich is attached aparallelincrease in\\ncomplexity ofnecessary relations.Theexample he uses is thatof\\nindustry,with-the explanation ofnational orinternational capitalat\\nthehighest, leastdisaggregated, levelandsectors,subsectors and\\nfirms at increasingly specified levels beneath them. This interpreta\\xad\\ntion raises a rangeofimportant issues.\\nTo begin with, in the way I wish to arguethe case, specificity is\\nnotaquestion oftaxonomic disaggregation . Specificity is nota\\nproductofincreasing subdivision bypre-defined characteristics but\\naquestion ofthearticulation inanyone instanceofcriss-crossing\\naxesofcausality andinfluence .Thus,although inpreceding\\nchapters reference is frequently madetosubdivisions (which, I\\ncansee,doesgivetheimpression thatwhatisatissueis\\ndisaggregation), whensuchcategories arecited(\\'bigclothing\\nfirms\\', for example) thereasonsforcitingthis as a grouparenot\\nsomuch-orperhaps notbest seen as - criteriaforsystematic\\ndisaggregations (systematic inthesensethattheymightbe\\nconsistent eachwiththeothers) butaxes(typeofcapital,\\ntechnology/labour process,placein theeconomy) ofcomplex\\narticulations whichmaybedifferent in eachindividual case,but\\nwhich may (or maynot)also lead to systematic linesofdifferentia\\xad\\ntion intermsof, forinstance, sectors/subsectors.\\nNow,asCochrane says,one\\'spositions ontheseabstruse\\narguments aboutexplanatory structures haveimportant political\\nconsequences. Thisis a large partofthereasonwhy they matter:\\ndifferent arguments on this issue openupdifferent avenues for\\nintervention andforaction.On thisparticular debate, it seems to\\nmethattherearetwopointswhich it is important to stress.\\nFirst,Cochrane isconcerned thatamethodological focusofthis\\ntypemightreflect a shiftaway from attempts toconfront or\\nchallenge capitalat thenational orinternational levelsandmight\\nimplyinsteadanapproach \\'ona piecemeal basis: sectorbysector,\\ntype by type . . .\\' (p. 362). However this is to imply thatspecificity\\nonly lies at the disaggregated level;itimpliesthatcapitalat the\\nnational orinternational level issomehow purecapital.Yet in fact\\nthewiderlevels are - in termsofthemodeofconceptualisation - no\\nless specific thanis theindividual firm:international capitalin the\\nninetiesis verydifferent ftomin the fifties, say, andBritishcapital,\\nas isstressed repeatedly throughout thebook,isdistinct in its\\ncharacter fromothernational capitals. InordertotackletheBritish\\neconomy politically it isnecessary tounderstand boththe factofits Reflections on Debates over a Decade 319\\ncapitalist natureandthepeculiarities ofits wayofbeing so. What\\ntroubles Cochrane here inotherwordsismoretheconcern with\\ninternalvariation, with the local level andsoforth,the very fact of\\na focus on thatlevel,andless the methodological termsofthe\\nconstruction ofspecificity.\\nThesecond,related, concern isthatbecause \\'thereis . . . an\\nincreased stresson theuniqueness ofindividual firmsorcapitals.\\nEach type becomes effectively insulated fromtheother\\'(p. 361).\\nHereagainit may be thatthe issue is morethestressonindividual\\nfirmsper sethantheexplanatory approach adopted towards\\nuniqueness . It isconceptualisation andexplanation on which I\\namfocusing here.Fortheapproach which is suggested analytically\\ntoconstruct uniqueness is precisely one whichstresses, orattempts\\ntostress,connections ratherthanseparations. Animportant\\ncomponent oftheconstruction ofuniqueness isthearticulation of\\naxes some ofwhich will be sharedwith firms (forinstance) inquite\\ndifferent groupings orsubdivisionsoftheeconomy. Inthesections\\nonchanging spatialstructures (thebulkofChapter 4, forinstance),\\nthisapproach iswhatis being attempted .Itis for this reasonthat\\nthereareconstant references between thedifferent (e.g.sectoral)\\nstudies.Inthis way, for instance, twogroupsoffirms are shownto\\nbesimilar(they are bothcomposed, say,oflarge firms - they have,\\ntherefore, forexample bothspatialandpolitical muscle). On the\\notherhand,withintheindustrial contextofthedifferent sectorsthe\\nmeaning ofsize isdifferent in each case (its implications are\\ndistinct). Moreover, thesectorsmayoccupydifferent placeswithin\\ntheeconomy andthusbedifferently affected byshiftsin the\\nnational andinternational capitalist economies. A small example\\nofthiscanbefoundonpage152(paragraphs 2and4),butthe\\nprinciple runs throughout theargument. Itis aprinciple whichboth\\nallowsstrategic connections to bemadebetween different partsof\\ntheeconomy andlinksindividual firms/subsectors to themajor\\nstructures ofsociety, whether thatbepolitical powerorglobal\\neconomic movements .Inthis, itsharesa lot with currentdebates\\nabouttheconstruction ofpolitical identityandpolitical allegiances\\n(seeMassey, 1994).Farfrom being isolating, it is an attempt to\\nunderscore thelinkages whicharepartofwhatconstructs\\nindividuality.\\nToreturn,however, to themoredirectlymethodological issues:\\nCochrane arguesthatthe \\'types becomesonarrowly definedtotake\\naccountofeach new case that, in fact, theredonotseem to be any 320SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\ngeneral rules - or necessary relations - at all. The dangeristhatan\\nempirical conjunction ofparticular events is transformed into a\\nnecessary relationship. If a new investment follows a different\\npatternthen new necessary relations are identified for a different\\ntypeoffirm\\' (p. 361). A preliminary caveat is here appropriate in\\nthat\\'general rules\\' (in the sense of empirically-generalisable out\\xad\\ncomes) are not the same as necessary relations. More centrally,\\nhowever, it has to be agreed thatthereissuch adanger,thoughit is\\nnotwhatisbeing argued for here. Norisit adangerconfined to any\\nparticular approach . In the last section (8.2) the habitofassuming\\nretrospectively thatwhat did happenhad tohappenissharply\\ncriticised (the example being thatof theprogression fromFordism\\ntosomething else). And certainly, as alsoarguedin the last section,\\noutcomes are notimmediate indications of\\'necessary character\\xad\\nistics\\'.Throughout thebookthere are numerous warnings precisely\\nagainsttaking empirical outcomes as giving direct and unproble\\xad\\nmatical access to necessary causal powers. However, it has to be\\naddedthatif indeed \\'a new investment\\' does follow \\'a different\\npattern\\'then, ifthatis a difference in which we are interested , the\\ntask will indeed be to build an accountofits causal structure which\\ndoes recognise thatvariation .\\nFinally,moreover, allofthis as is constantly stressed, all ofthese\\naxesofarticulation, do not arrive raw at the factory gate. They\\nhave to be interpreted by the actors involved, they have to be\\nunderstood ;and the way thathappens will vary, and have effects.\\nOtherrelated issues were raised by a groupofsociologists at\\nLancaster University in the late 1980s,who over a period ofyears\\nengaged with, developed and elaborated many of the ideas in\\nSpatialDivisions ofLabour.2They were also working within a\\nframework which tried to combine someofthe insights ofMarxism\\nand critical realism. It is in thatcontextthattwoclarifications are\\nworthmakingat thispoint.Theybothconcern thestructure of\\nexplanations .\\nThe first pointis at first sight trivial but it has provided for me,\\nover the years, one of the clearest examples bothof how works have\\na lifeoftheir own (they are actively read as wellas actively written)\\nandofthe power ofrhetoric in its widest (and not derogatory)\\nsense. In his influential writing in this area a member ofthe\\nLancaster group,AlanWarde,tookup the idea ofthe specificity\\noflocal economies, and indeed ofunevendevelopment more widely,\\nbeingconstructed outofthesuperimposition andcombination of Reflections on Debates over a Decade 321\\nsuccessive roundsofinvestment; hedubbed it\\'anextended\\nmetaphor ofthegeology ofsocialrelations\\' (Warde, 1985,\\np. 191).\\'The metaphor\\', he writes, \\'is geological; successive rounds\\nofaccumulation depositlayersofindustrial sediment ingeographi\\xad\\ncal space\\' (Warde, 1985,pp. 196-7). Ithad a nice ring to it, it was a\\nquickwayofreferring to thenotionoflayers,it was used\\nextensively by the Lancaster groupin theirpublications; itspread\\nand became accepted. The automatic modeofreference became:\\nMassey\\'s geological metaphor .\\nNow, Alan Wardein no way meantthis negatively andindeed he\\nwent on to use and develop the said metaphor. Noris this an\\nargument againstmetaphors - they are a necessary partofour\\nmeans of thinking. However the popularacceptance ofthis view of\\nwhat I was doing- thisparticular metaphor -andthe way that\\nsubsequent authorssimply copied it into their own articles, caused\\nme no little discomfort. Foritdidn\\'t, anddoesn\\'t, reallycapture\\nwhatI was trying to get at. The basic definition to which Warde\\nrefers (p. 197; it is to Massey, 1979, pp. 234-5) makes no mentionof\\ngeology and in my own writings I have only found one hint,in\\nChapter3ofthisbookwhere I refer to sedimentation andstrata. Be\\nthat as it may, geology is notanappropriate wayofenvisaging the\\nlayering process I had in mind. Forit reduces the fluidity, the\\nrelational nature,andthefundamental processes ofmutual\\ninteraction andmoulding which I wantedto convey. Surely the\\nnotionofthecombination oflayers is very ungeological. In the\\ngeological version only the sedimentation and the (differential)\\nsubsequent erosionarecaptured. Whatis missed includes most\\nimportantly the factthatthe layers themselves are constructed in\\npartoutofsocialrelations, networks ofinterconnections across\\nspace, and the fact that- crucially - they interact. And they interact\\nbothinmoulding thecharacter the one oftheotherandin\\nproducing , inconsequence , radical differences in anyone layer\\nbetween different areas.\\nThey also interact through activehumanagency. Places are\\nemphatically not to be conceptualised as \\'thevictimsofcapital\\'\\n(Bagguley et al.,1990, p. 2, emphasis in original). But this raises a\\nsecond issue. Bagguley et al.(1990) write oftheapproach : \\'we have\\npreviously dubbedthis the\"geological metaphor\", describing as it\\ndoes the ways in which these divisions oflabouroverlie each other\\ntoconstitute distinctregions and localities\\' (p. 2) - it is a clearcase\\nof the use ofthe geological image being associated with a lack of 322 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nattention tointeraction andcombination . However in their own\\nwork the Lancaster group,unlike others who went on to adoptthe\\nmetaphor, do payconsiderable attention to these issues. The way in\\nwhich they do so, however, is interesting. In a numberofplaces\\nthey call for \\'rulesofcombination\\'. Thus:\\'Itis then necessary to\\ndetermine the rules ofcombination between variousclass residues\\nin any place, since different combinations willproduce different\\npolitical effects\\'(Warde, 1985, p. 199). This is consistent with a\\nmore general approach ofthisgroup,which seeks such rules of\\ncombination , ortransformation rules, in shifts between spatial\\ndivisions oflabourover time (p. 198), within labourmarkets\\n(p. 205), and between struggles over production andconsumption\\n(p. 209) (see also Bagguley et al.,1990).3 I am doubtful aboutthe\\nnatureand validity ofthis project. First,as they themselves point\\nout, the multiplicity ofpotential combinations isenormous , even\\nwhen one startsfrom only a fewelements. There seems to me to be\\nnopointin the kind of exercise which ends up with \\'well over\\n100,000\\' possible com binations (Shapiro, 1987,cited in Bagguley et\\nal.):the main message to be drawnis indeed the complexity ofthe\\nanalytical task inhand.And Bagguley et al.are right to pointout\\nthatthis\\'shouldmake it clear how problematic it is toappealto a\\n\"logicofaccumulation \" asaccounting for an observed empirical\\ntrend\\'(p. 9).\\nBut what does thatmean for the call for rules ofcombination ?\\nOn the one handit is easily possible to generate so many thatthe\\ntask becomes unmanageable, but if on the otherhandtoo few\\nelements are analysed theircombination is likely to be such a small,\\norunderspecified, partofanyactualempirical situation thatits\\ncontribution couldbebothminimal and anyway overridden. This,\\nit seems to me, poses a real issue for an approach such as realism\\nwhich aims to take seriously boththe need for theory and the\\nrecognition ofcomplexity (it isofcourse no dilemma at all for those\\napproaches which refuse to see the complexity in the first place).\\nBut a call for \\'rules\\'is no way out. The problem indicated above\\nresults from the fact thatwhat we are dealing with are open\\nsystems, and this open natureofsocial systems has to be faced\\ndirectly. Neither\\'extreme\\' solution isavailable , even in principle.\\n(The systems cannotbeclosed for experimental purposes norcan all\\npossible outcomes be specified.) The best approach seems to be\\nalong the lines suggested in the discussion above ofevaluation and\\nofcounterfactuals .Fornotalloutcomes areequally likely, Reflections on Debates over a Decade 323\\nempirical understandings can be built up which will bothfeed\\nback into theoretical understanding and guide the structuring of\\nfutureempirical work. But there is a furtherproblem in the\\nformulation in terms of \\'rules\\'. Thus, at the end ofoneofhis\\narticlesWardesuggests \\'thatanysatisfactory account ofthe\\ngeologyofsocialrelations\\' should satisfy certaincriteria.The first\\nofthese asks for \\'transformation rules\\' which account for the\\nstructuring ofindustrial layers over time in a given area. \\'Second\\',\\nsuch an account \\'should be able to specify determinately the\\npolitical outcomes contingent upondifferent kindsoflocalised\\nsystemsofsocialrelations. This would entail being able to classify\\nthe typical effects ofdifferent combinations ofclass, gender and\\npopular forces\\'(Warde, 1985,p.209).This, it seems to me, is a\\nrequirement which it is in principle impossible to satisfy. Notonly\\ndo the meanings and contentofsuch terms as class and gender vary\\nradically between cultures and historical periods(though in his\\nfourthand final requirement , Warde asks thatthere is sufficient\\nelaboration and specification \\'topermitreconnection with historical\\nevidence\\' [po210]),but also this kind of notionof rules really does\\nput inquestion any effectivity ofagency.Itseems to be asking for a\\ndeterminism ofconsciousness . Actors always interpret their situa\\xad\\ntions, and do so with an ever-changing arrayofinterpretive\\nmaterials .Bourdieu (1977)has aptly commented on this kind of\\ndebate, neatly linking the call for rules with the chaoticmultiplicity\\nofpotential outcomes :\\'Itis necessary to abandon all theories which\\nexplicitly or implicitly treatpractice as amechanical reaction,\\ndirectly determined by theantecedent conditions andentirely\\nreducible to the mechanical functioning ofpre-established assem\\xad\\nblies, \"models\" or \"roles\" - which one would, moreover , have to\\npostulate ininfinitenumber\\' (p. 73). IndeedBagguley etat.\\nconfront this issue themselves in one oftheir studies ofLancaster\\n(pp.187-8).\\nYetwhatwearefacedwith is complexity, notinherent\\nindeterminancy in the sense thatalloutcomes are equally likely,\\northatno general statements can be made. Again, even in the case\\nofhumanagency, there are practical limits on what a person can do\\nand the range ofbeliefsthey can act on. Itispossible to unearthby\\nin-depth analysis key causalrelations, including combinations,\\nwhich may be replicated, even dominant, innumbers ofsitua\\xad\\ntions.Itisperhaps thisapproach ,ratherthanaformulation of\\nrules, which will be most productive. 324 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nAfinalnote on variety and specificity\\nThereis no necessary relation, then, between a thoroughgoing\\nrecognition ofvariation and specificity on the one handand a\\nretreatinto\\'description \\' orempiricism on the other.Thereis more\\nthatone can do with the uniquethan simply contemplate it (p. 116).\\nApartfrom the fact that\\'description\\' must always anyway be\\ntheory-dependent, what is at issue, perhaps, is more the nature\\nand role oftheoretical work. \\'General laws\\' are aboutcausation,\\nconnection, interdependence - andtherefore conceptualisation - not\\nempirical correlation (p. 116). Indeed, from the pointofviewofthe\\napproach adopted in this work, it would be bettertoabandon\\ncompletely theterms\\'description\\' and\\'laws\\'in thiskindof\\ndiscussion. The role oftheoretical work is in the conceptualisation\\nofobjectsofstudy,in thetheorisation ofcausalpowersand\\nrelations, in theestablishment offrameworks, themselves not as a\\nsetofimmutable tendencies but more as a way oflookingat the\\nworld (Sayer, 1984). Indeed the recognition ofbothvariety and\\nspecificity islinked up to particular theoretical approaches, or forms\\nofexplanation.

This is an answer which might emerge\\nfrommanyastrandofpostmodernist thought.

This is true bothin the sense ofwhat isimportant to\\nexamine and in the sense thatthe very construction ofdifference\\nrelies on an understanding ofbroaderstructures.

Yet 326SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nrecognising specificity does not in any way anyway imply a\\nconcentration on local politics in the sense usually understood ; a\\nfocus,thatis, on very small-scale actions.

Ratherthan as scatterings of isolated\\nphenomena, thesedistributions were to be conceptualised as the\\ninterconnected phenomena of social relations stretched out to form\\na space. The aim was thatthis should enable us to think the politics\\nof place and uneven development in a different way.\\nThereis a sequence of steps in this reconceptualisation of\\neconomic space. The first, and the one which is usually omitted\\nthereby leading to an inability to perform the others, is to take\\nseriously the conceptualisation of the object of study (say,jobs and\\ntypes of jobs).As with capitalas a class (see above)these\\nphenomena with which industrial geography conventionally deals\\nare rarely seriously considered in their natureas objects of study.\\nYet one of the crucial lessons of Marxism, for instance, for work in\\nthis area is to recognise things as constituted by relations: capital is\\narelation, thevarious classesin asocietyareconstituted\\nrelationally with each other, and so forth. Likewisejobs and types\\nofjobs: they are phenomena of different positions within the overall\\ncomplexity of the social relations ofproduction ; the existence and Reflections on Debates over a Decade 327\\nspecificity ofone type ofjob(say, specialist manager) depends on\\nthe existence and specificity ofjobsdesigned to do otherpartsof\\nthe overall division oflabour.Oneoftheattractions ofWright\\'s\\nframework was the detail with which he had begun to think this\\nthrough.Moreover hisframework not only analyses occupational\\nfunctions but links them to class position, inparticular tointra\\xad\\nclassvariations (though I disagreed then, and continue to do so,\\nwith many of the conclusions he drew from his approach). Thus\\nwhat was immediately possible was a linking oftheconceptualisa\\xad\\ntionofjobsin terms ofrelations with an analysis ofelements of\\nclass, between thatisindustrial geography and the geography of\\nsocialstructure.\\nIf, then, a particular managerial job,say, can be conceptualised\\nas a setoffunctions bothspecified by and existing in relationto\\notherjobswithin the economy, then the next step is to think ofthis\\nspatially.Insteadof, say, different types of jobseach with their own\\n(same or different) geographical distribution there are different sets\\nofinterdependent functions held togetherin tension by sets ofsocial\\nrelations stretched out between them. Uneven development is then\\nan issue ofthegeography ofthatdivisionoflabourandofthe\\nsocial relations ofproduction , and not merely ofmore or different\\njobs/investment here than there; a \\'core\\'region is not just,or even\\nnecessarily, the one with all the bestjobs, or even the most jobsin a\\nparticular sector, say, but the one from which run the dominant\\nlinesofcontrol, ofstrategic direction, ofcrucialconnections; a\\nspatialstructure ofproduction (as in this book) is not a distribution\\nofjobsbut ageography ofsocial relations. Thinking in terms of\\nrelations startsfrom the interdependence ofphenomena and thus of\\nthe spaces they construct: this applies to jobswithin a division of\\nlabour(see, for instance, p. 206)and to regions within an economy.\\nWhatis at issue is the spatial form ofcertainaspectsofsocial\\npower.Moreover, this matters: \\'Itmattersin what kind of spatial\\nstructure aplantisembedded .Itmattersin terms ofthe kind of\\nrelations ofdominance andsubordination which exist between\\nplants in different localities, it mattersfor the people who work\\nin the plants, and it matterspolitically\\' (p. 104). Thinking in terms\\nof relations gives access to causality.\" It enables a more robust\\napproach to theconstitution and reproduction ofthe space ofa\\ncertain set ofsocial relations.\\nOne of the most crucial developments which has taken place, in\\nthe UK and most otherfirst world countries, in the decades since 328SpatialDivisionsojLabour\\nthe sixtieshas been the expansion and consolidation of white-collar\\nmiddle-income professional and managerial strata. The size and\\npower of this group has become a stubborn fact of social structure,\\na vital stake in the play of politics, and - I would argue, as do the\\npreceding chapters - oneofthe most important (andprobably\\nimplacable) problems facing any attempt to work towards less\\nuneven forms of spatial development.\\nAs groups they have emerged from the more detailed structuring\\nandseparating-out offunctions within the division of labour,and\\nthe relations in which they exist with other groups are often ones\\nwhich give them considerable power. Different sub-groups within\\nthem have been lionised by successive governments and political\\nrhetorics. Moreover, and on top of all this, they have a very\\nparticular geography. Itis a geography of both concentration and\\nprivilege. Their distribution is quite highly focused in particular\\nareas of the country, as previous chapters show (and although I am\\nspeaking here of the UK, the same is true of many if not most first\\nworld countries). And these are parts ofthecountrywhich tend to\\nbe already privileged, whether thatbe the capital city, at a regional\\nlevelthesoutheasternpartof thecountry,or more locally the areas\\nof perceived environmental attraction . Classically, they are to be\\nfound far less in areas dominated by blue-collar manufacturing, in\\ntheindustrial areas of the north,in localities which are in decline.\\nThere is a two-sidedness to this distribution. Policy-makers often\\nargue that the presence of such groups is a reason for the health of\\nthe areas in which they live; and the conclusion is drawn that\\nattracting white-collar professionals into areas of decline would\\nhelp them grow too. But while there is some truthin this as an\\nobservation the causal conclusions drawn are in an important sense\\nthe wrong way around.It is even more the case thatthese social\\ngroupsaboundinparticular areasbecausethey are healthy. The\\nsocial power of these groups (for instance, their bargaining power\\nwithin the labourmarket) givesthem a power of choice of location,\\nwhich may be fed throughtheperception of their preferences by the\\ncompanies which seek their labourpower. And they exercise that\\npower overwhelmingly to avoid the physical and social environment\\nof decline (perhaps the only exception, though it still replicates this\\npatternat a much smaller spatial scale,is thatofgentrification). But\\nwhat this means is thatthese groups use their social power to\\nreinforce theirprivilege through location. Andthatinturn\\nexacerbates the unevenness of uneven development. Reflections on Debates over a Decade 329\\nSuchgroupsfigure largely in the analyses ofthisbook,andthe\\nattemptto get to grips with them from a geographical perspective is\\naclearexample ofboththemethodand theadvantages of\\'thinking\\nin terms ofrelations\\' - asappliedbothto these groupsthemselves\\nandto the spaces they create.Fromthebeginning thegroupsare\\nconceptualised intermsofWright\\'s classframework. Thatis to say,\\nthey are interpreted asperformers offunctions withintheoverall\\ndivision ofpaidlabour:this is the aspectoftheirclassposition\\nwhich isofinterest(thoughas isstressedtherelations ofproduction\\nby nomeansprovidea fullaccountoftheirsocialcharacter). A first\\nthingwhich emerges from this approach is acleardifferentiation\\nwithin the groupas a whole. In the analyses here it is the broad\\nlinesofoneofthesedistinctions on which attention is focused: the\\ndistinction between managerial strataandcertainprofessional\\nstrata,particularly thosein scientific andresearch occupations.\\nTheinitialdistinction between thesesubgroups emerges by\\nexamination oftherelations ofproduction, withinwhich they are\\ndifferently placed.Managerial strataareconcerned withthe\\nrelations ofeconomic ownership andpossession andplacedon\\nthedimension ofthe class framework between proletariat and\\nbourgeoisie, while scientific andresearch workers arepartofa\\ndivisionoflabourwithinproduction whicharticulates thefunctions\\ncommonly referredto asconceptualisation (heremainlyintermsof\\nthetechnical product) andexecution ,andareplacedonthe\\ndimension ofthe class framework between proletariat andpetty\\nbourgeoisie (see, for instance, Figures2.1, 3.1andespecially 3.5).\\nThesetwosubgroups , inotherwords,whichmightin some ways\\nlooksimilar,andhaveindeedinindustrial geography oftenbeen\\nundifferentiated, in factperform different functions withinthe\\noveralldivisionoflabourandhavequitedifferent locations within\\nthe class structure (see, for instance, pp.37-8,109and221).Each\\nhasdistinctrelations with otherintra-class groups.Moreover , this\\ndifferent socialplacingis reflected in the ratherdifferent geogra\\xad\\nphiesofthe twogroups(seeChapter 4andpp.277-8forinstance)\\nand in the forms ofgeographical inequality in which they are\\nimplicated .\\nTheargument here links up with morerecentworkon the\\ncomposition of\\'themiddleclass\\'.ThusSavageandhiscolleagues\\nwhodrawonratherlaterworkby Eric Olin Wrightthanthatused\\nhere come up with quitesimilarlinesofdistinction (Savageet al.,\\n1992;Wright, 1985). They too stress thatthe key distinction is 330SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nbetweenmanagers andprofessionals (thoughinSpatialDivisions of\\nLabouronly a small range ofprofessionals, mostparticularly\\nscientists and researchers, was considered in detail).5 Whatthe\\npreceding chapters alsopointto, however, isthe differential rates of\\nnumerical growth of these subgroups between different historical\\nperiods, in this case since the sixties. Moreover these historically\\nvarying rates of growth are not synchronised between the two\\ngroups. There is clearly a whole range offactors in play here,\\namongthem both technological developments (which may enable\\ntheseparation-out and definition of distinct functions) and, most\\nparticularly, thenatureof the ruling national politico-economic\\nstrategy. The mix of the middle class which established itselfunder\\nHaroldWilson, for example, was very different from that which\\nflourished underMargaret Thatcher .Thishas anumber of\\nimplications .Itindicates thatthenatureand extent of intergenera\\xad\\ntional mobility - and variations in such mobility between different\\npartsof the middle class - will vary over time. Itpoints to a\\n(further) potential basis for different politics between the groups. It\\nindicates thatthegeography of the middle class will have shifted in\\ndifferent ways over time, and that therefore the forms of spatial\\ninequality in which they are embedded willlikewisehave changed in\\nrelativeimportance. Forit is clear thatthe various sections ofthis\\nclass have been caughtup in very different dynamics, both spatially\\nand socially, between generations.\\nThe analysis in the preceding chapters also shares with Savage et\\n01.a concern with the geographical articulation of these groups, and\\nsome similar conclusions emerge. There is agreement on the crucial\\nlineofdifferentiation between the south-east and the rest ofthe\\ncountry, although what emerges from the preceding chapters isthat\\nthe linearoundthesouth-east should not be tightly drawnand\\ncertainly should not be restricted to the area oftheStandard\\nRegion. Massey, Quintas and Wield (1992) also provide some\\nsupport, thoughagain only in relation to high-tech professionals,\\nfor the recent blurring of theboundaries betweenmanagerial and\\nprofessional groups within the south-east. But the wider evidence\\nsuggests thateven inthatregion the distinction between the two\\ngroupsis stillnotablebothsocially and geographically . Indeed the\\nanalysis here would stress even more stronglythe way in which the\\nspatiality ofthesegroupsis integral to their formation .Ithas\\nalreadybeen seen thatthe different placing of these groups in terms\\nof the social relations ofproduction enables them to adoptrather Reflections on Debates over a Decade 331\\ndifferent geographical distributions .Whatis at issue now is a\\nreverse effect, from the spatialto the social. Itcanhappenin two\\nways. First, justasdevelopments within the technology andthe\\nsocialrelations ofproduction enabled(onlyenabled; they did not\\ndetermine) theseparation-out ofthesegroupsbothsocially and\\nspatially, sospatialseparation was acondition ofthedevelopment\\nofcertainaspectsofthe division oflabour.Thus,oftheseparation\\nofeconomic ownership from possession and the development of\\ncomplex hierarchies within each it is arguedthat\\'thedevelopment\\nandincreasing complexity of these relations took place over space\\nand in a geographically differentiated context. Multi-locationality\\nitself, as much as the increasing sizeoffirms (the only thing usually\\nreferred to) must have been important inproducing the need for\\nsuchhierarchies andininfluencing the forms which they have taken\\nand the kinds of division oflabourwhich have developed within\\nthesefunctions .\"Geography\" has been an essential constructive\\nelement in their development\\' (p. 69).Or again \\'Spatialstructure , in\\notherwords, is an active element in accumulation .Moreover,\\nprecisely because geographical form can influence the rate of\\naccumulation, it may well be thatoneoftheconditions for the\\ndevelopment ofparticular kinds of technical division oflabour\\nwithinproduction in the first place is the existence ofparticular\\nkinds of geographical differentiation , forinstance in thelabour\\nmarket.Inotherwords, it is not only that\"thedifferent stages in\\nthe technical division oflabouraredistinguished bylocationally\\nrelevant characteristics\" and are therefore spreadoutindifferent\\nlocations. It is also thatthe very existence ofsuch differences\\nbetween lo cationsmay be a stimulus to thedevelopment ofa\\ntechnical division oflabourwhich enables advantage to betakenof\\nthem\\'(p. 72).Whatthis ispushingtowardsis somereformulation\\noftheexplanation ofthedevelopment ofmanagerial hierarchies\\n(andofparticular formsoftechnical division oflabourand so\\nforth)whichallowsexplicit recognition ofthedifferentiated\\ngeography which is not only the contextin which they develop\\nbut which may also be partoftheprovocation totheirdevelopment\\nin the first place and to their particular form. Second, once in their\\nparticular geographical locations thespatialenvirons in which they\\nliveare likely to have furthereffects upon the social natureofthese\\ngroups, maybe even being specifically used to thateffect (see\\nMassey, Quintas and Wield, 1992, on location andstatusamong\\nscientists in high-technology companies) through the influence of 332SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nspatialdistancing, socialcontext, ormobility, forinstance (see\\npp.143-4).\\nFinally, conceptualising these social groups, andtheirspatial\\ndistributions, intermsofthesocialrelations ofclasshelps\\nreformulate thequestions which arise for the labourmovement\\nfromtheirunevengeographies: itchanges thepolitical analysis.For\\nthese highly unequal geographies presuppose thestretching outover\\nspaceofsocialrelations whichembody greatpower,ofdirection\\nandcontrolin the case ofmanagerial hierarchies, andofstrategic\\nvisionandextreme inequality inrelation to thelabourprocess,\\nespecially in thecaseofscientific /professional workers.These\\naspectsareadditional to themoreimmediately evidentinequal\\xad\\nities,ofincomeforinstance.Whatisat issue is boththespatiality of\\nthisformofpower(andspatialformmaybepartofthe\\nconstruction ofthatpower)andtheconstruction ofapower-filled\\nspace.

At a quite concrete\\nlevel, this approach can influence the way in which place /locality/\\nregion is thoughtabout.Notonly are \\'localities\\' the productof the\\narticulation ofsocialrelations at a wide range ofgeographical\\nscales, but they are con stantlybeing formed and transformed (see,\\nforinstance, pp.188-9and289).Section5.2(The coalfield areas,\\np.188)examines this phenomenon ,ofthereorientation ofa whole\\nregion in terms ofits role within a wider space andoftheinternal\\nspatialreworking which goes alongwiththat.As is said ofthe\\nregionalgeography ofthe period as a whole \\'even the shape ofthe\\nmap has been refashioned \\' (p.288).\\nHowever , if this map is to be conceptualised in terms ofsocial\\nrelations existing between economic functions /socialgroupswhich\\naremutually defining in relationto a division oflabour, then some\\nspecification ofthe overall labourto beperformed is necessary. In\\ndetail this will always be impossible . Since \\'the totalwork to be\\nperformed\\' itself has to be defined socially, the system is almostby\\ndefinition to some degree open. Nonethe less, there are two\\nimportant ways in which the empirical, and in one ofthe cases\\nalso the theoretical , analyses in SpatialDivisions ofLabourcan be\\nextended here. Both of them are highlighted bycurrentdevelop\\xad\\nments. 334SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThefirstconcerns unpaidlabour.Wright\\'s framework istypical\\nofapproaches to theanalysisofclass in thatitdealsexclusively\\nwithpaidlabour(indeedinsomeways it has to be stretched to deal\\nwith allofthat).Andthepreceding chapters,notwithstanding some\\nclearrecognitionofthe issue (Elaborations ,p. 39), went alongwith\\nthat.Now, theconcept ofspatialdivision oflabourwasnever\\nmeant, bymyselfat least, to encompass unevendevelopment in\\neverysphereoflife. Inthatsense I have somereservations about\\nattempts toextendit toincludewideareasofcivilsociety, for\\ninstance, andall the issues ofwhatissometimes called\\'reproduc\\xad\\ntion\\' (see, for instance, Warde, 1985) although. andthis is an\\nimportant caveat, anyfullunderstanding ofthereasons for\\nparticular spatialstructures /spatialdivisions oflabourforinstance\\nmustinevitably lookmorewidely - as the preceding chapters to\\nsomeextentdo - at social relations andprocesses beyondtheworld\\nofemployment. Sotoo, evenmorecrucially, mustanyfullanalysis\\nofclasspositions. Nonethe less, the focus ofconcern ofthe\\nconcepts spatialstructure /spatialdivisionoflabouris the space of\\npaidwork,andit is soquitedeliberately.\\nHowever ,thereis amethodological problem with this restriction .\\nFor,given some broadnotionofthelabourto beperformed in a\\nsocietyatanyhistorical period, theboundary between thatwhichis\\nperformed aspaidworkandthatwhich is unpaidwillnotbe\\ndeterminate. Itwill vary between social classes, between regions,\\nbetween different typesofhouseholds (nuclear, singlepeople, etc.)\\nand-crucially -overtime. In manycountries overthe lastdecade\\ntherehas been a decisive shift,through cutsinpublicexpenditure\\nandpublicservices, orstructural adjustment programmes inthird\\nworldcountries forinstance,ofcertaintypesofworkfrompaid\\nemployment towards theunpaidsector.Whatthismeansisthatthe\\noverall\\'system\\'ofpaidworkisundefined andthattherefore the\\nmutually-determining natureofthedifferent elements withinit is\\nlesssecure.Thustheframework ofspatialdivisions oflabour, the\\nconceptualisation ofjobsasmutually-defining interdependent\\nfunctions ,couldimportantly beextended toencompass those\\nvariable processes through which the paid/unpaid boundary is\\nconstructed andwhichwillvaryfromthepolitico-economic\\nactivities oftheState,thevarying characteristics anddemands\\n(bothmaterial andsymbolic) ofdifferent typesofpaidemployment,\\ninherited andchanging formulations offemininity andmasculinity\\nto, forinstance, negotiations withinthehousehold .PQuiteapart Reflections on Debates over a Decade 335\\nfrom all the manyotherreasonsforstudying thisinterface, this\\nparticular entryinto theareaunderlines from yet anotherangle the\\ninterdependence ofthe paid and unpaidsectorsofsociety.\\nThereis afurtherway in which the formulation ofelements of\\ndivisions of labourinpreceding chapters has left the overall\\'labour\\'\\nunderspecified . Here there is no tight exclusion, as there was of\\nunpaidlabour,butneitheris there a clear specification. The focus\\nofSpatial Divisions ofLabouris onnational (andfirst world,\\ncapitalist) economies, andagainthis was deliberately so: the\\nconcern was with intra-national divisions oflabour. Nonethe\\nless, such economies areoftenvery open in terms oftrade.They\\nare set in systems ofproduction which go beyondthem. They are,\\ntherefore, concomitantly embedded indivisions oflabour.and\\nspatialstructures ofproduction which also go beyondthem. This\\ntoocouldhave been moredeveloped in thepreceding chapters (as a\\nnumberofreviewers pointedout).The results ofsuch anextension\\nwould be twofold (at least). It would underline therelations of\\ndomination andsubordination which the variouspartsoftheUK\\'s\\n(oranyothercountry\\'s) economic structure andthevarious\\nlocalities have with otherpartsoftheworld.Anditwould\\nhighlight thegreatdifferences whichexist in theserelations\\nbetween geographical areas. Thislatterissue has become increas\\xad\\ninglyimportant, certainly in the UK, over the last decade.Inmany\\neconomies regions are now clearly embedded in very different\\ninternational spatialstructures; inthatsense there is an increased\\nfracturing ofnational economies. In theUnitedKingdom, for\\ninstance, thestarkcontrast is between the southandeastofthe\\ncountryand thenorthand west. In the south-east agoodnumberof\\nthedominant elements exist inrelations ofcomparative controlin\\nrelationtootherpartsof theinternationalised spatialstructures in\\nwhich they are embedded . This is the case, for instance, in finance,\\nincertainprofessional services, in aspects ofhigh-technology, in\\nmultinational companies inbothservicesandmanufacturing, and\\nso on. The position ofthese activities within the international\\neconomic hierarchies is not as dominant as in some cases it used to\\nbe,noris suchdominance typical of all partsofthesouth-east\\neconomy. But it is an important and,I would argue,structurally\\ncharacterising, element. The relation of thenorthandwest to\\ninternationalised spatialstructures is verydifferent. Theirpresent\\npositions, andtheir likely futures, within the international division\\noflabouraresharplycontrasting . 336SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nThere isa furtherissueraised by the generalisation ofthe concept\\nof space as social relations, and which again reflects back on the\\nargument of the preceding chapters.The strong, and still important,\\narguments of the seventies and eighties thatspace is socially\\nconstituted andthat,conversely, the social necessarily has a spatial\\ncontent/form had a tendency in much work to remain at the levelof\\nslogans. The precise ways in which these statements were true, and\\ntheir implications, were less often ferretted out. SpatialDivisions of\\nLabourspells out in some detail the natureofsome of these\\nrelations and mechanisms, but itdoes so for only a limited range\\nof thepotential formsofsocial spatiality. In partthis is simply\\nbecause its remit is limited - it is concerned only with thatlimited\\nbit of societyengaged by industrial geography. But evenwithin that\\nitsprimaryconcern is with one kind of social relation over space:\\nthatofrelatively orderedspatialstructures within firms.\\nThepointaboutorderedspatialstructures within companies is\\nthatthey represent only one kind of relationship between the social\\nand the spatial. They are, in a sense, \\'planned spaces\\'; their spatial\\narrangement is to one degree or anotherdeliberate: it is partofthe\\nconstitution of thestructure itself. The relationship between a\\nheadquarters and a set of otherlocations (regional headquarters,\\nproduction branch plants of various functions,etc.) isan element of\\nwhat might becalled orderedspatiality. Moreover, the natureof this\\njointsocial-spatial ordering has implications - the spatial form is\\nprecisely meantto have social effects, to increase profits by location\\naccording to differential criteria, to undermine workers\\' bargaining\\xad\\npower by multi-sourcing at a number of disparate places, and so\\nforth (which is not to say thatit does not have other, unforeseen,\\neffectsaswell).This isone kind ofwayinwhich \\'geography matters\\'.\\nHowever, there are otherkinds of economic relations which\\ncontribute to theconstitution of the spaces of industrial geography.\\nChief among theseare marketrelations betweenfirms, and these are\\nfar less considered in the preceding chapters.\\'Thenatureof the\\nconnection between the social and the spatial in marketrelations\\ncan vary greatly. In some cases the natureof the firm and its\\nlocationrelative to others can be intimately linked: the two things\\nmay beplannedtogether. Inothercases,already-established firms\\nmay set up marketrelations becauseofa spatial propinquity which\\noccurred for otherreasons altogether. There are also cases, of\\ncourse, where neither plannednormarketrelations exist. Thatis,\\nthere are activities and groups which are mutually indifferent in Reflections on Debates over a Decade 337\\nsocial terms, but which none the less necessarily exist in spatial\\nrelationto eachother.Their relative locations are alsopartofwhat\\nconstructs social space. The pointisthatin each case the relation\\nbetween the social and the spatialisdifferent, and the impactofthe\\none upon the otheriscorrespondingly varied. In the case where\\ncontacts between companies occur only because ofpropinquity,\\nspatialform can be seen to be influencing the form ofsocial\\nrelations throughitscharacter ofbeing inpartunplanned. While it\\nwill bepossible toexplainthelocations ofcompany Aand\\ncompany B individually, their relative spatiallocation may not\\nhave a direct cause, the two locations having been arrivedat\\nindependently . But such \\'accidental\\' relativespatiallocations may\\nhave effects, perhaps enabling/provoking contacts between the\\ncompanies , for instance. Thus the accidental juxtapositions and\\ndistancings ofsocial space may throughtheir bringing together and\\nseparating ofsocialphenomena have an effect on how those\\nphenomena work. Such effects may be \\'positive\\' or\\'negative\\'\\n(negative externalities are a clear case ofthelatter). Thepointis\\nthatsocial space has aspects both of\\'order\\'andof\\'chaos\\' (Massey,\\n1992),oftheintended andunintended, the directly plannedand the\\nunplanned - andofattempts atnegotiated stabilisations in between\\n- which represent bothdifferent types ofrelations between \\'the\\nsocial\\' and \\'thespatial\\'anddifferent sources for the impactofthe\\nlatteron theformer.Thesecontrasting aspectsofspatiality\\nhighlight different aspects of the geography of power relations\\nand indicate different sources ofcontradictions potentially existing\\nin thespatiality ofthe social.\\nAs has been said, SpatialDivisionsofLabourconcentrates firmly\\non only one aspectofthesemultifarious possibilit ies:spatial\\nstructures within firms. It must be stressed, for there has occasion\\xad\\nally been some confusion, thatspatialstructures are not the same as\\nspatialdivisions oflabour. While the former are intra-company\\nconcepts, the term spatialdivisionoflabourrefers to a more overall\\nform of uneven development, which will vary over time, and which\\nis theproductofall thespatial structures ofproduction then in\\nexistence, but - it is hypothesised - most likely dominated by (in the\\nsenseofstructured by, not of numerical dominance) one or a small\\ngroup of spatialstructures . Animportant question at issue there\\xad\\nfore, and which is not centrally addressed in the preceding chapters,\\nis thenatureofthe relations (including non-relations) between\\nspatialstructures inconstructing spatialdivisions oflabour. 338SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nElaborating theinvestigation ofspatialdivisions oflabourin this\\nwayopensanalysis to thedifferent degrees andnaturesof\\nintegration, ornon-integration, of activities within local/regional\\neconomies, and the powerrelations through which this is con\\xad\\nstructed. Places/localities /regionswill most frequently beembedded\\nin amultitude ofspatialstructures, andpartof their specificity\\ncomes from the articulation ofthesestructures within them, and the\\nemergent effects which result, as well as from the role ofthe place\\nwithin its wider setting. Settingthe analysis ofspatialstructures in a\\nwider view of spatiality bothenables analysis ofthisinternal\\nstructure andopensthe way to thinking more clearly aboutthe\\nstructural potential of localeconomic strategies (seeLovering, 1986;\\nandFincher, 1986).It opens it also to the powerstructures ofinter\\xad\\nfirm, as well as intra-firm, relations throughwhichdifferent places\\narearticulated into aneconomy. Analysis in this vein would, for\\ninstance, pointto the precise ways in which the northern and\\nwestern regions of the UK have over recent decades been seriously\\ndis-integrated , in the sense ofincreasingly being the loci for\\ncollections ofspatialstructures which have little in the way of\\ndirectand active economic relationwith each other.Such a process\\nisprobably happening to themajority ofregional/local economies\\nas they become more directly linked into globalspatialstructures ;\\nindeed such a phenomenon isoftenremarked upon. But the wayin\\nwhich it is happening, anditsconsequences, will vary from case to\\ncase.\\nThe analysis ofindustrial districtscould be enriched alongsimilar\\nlines,throughamorerigorous conceptualisation oftheirspatiality.\\nThecontentofsocialpowerwhichimbuestheinter-firm linkages\\nwhich criss-cross the districts, the social relations which locate (and\\ntherebyhelpconstruct) people in particular labour-market positions\\nwithin them, the shiftingflowsofdominance andsubordination in\\nthe wider relations which link these districtsto the world economy,\\ntotheirexportmarkets, tomultinational capital- aconsideration\\nofall these would greatlyaidourunderstanding ofindustrial\\ndistricts andourassessment of their potential future(see, for\\ninstance, Amin and Robins, 1990, and Amin, 1994). Itwould be\\npossible to begin from locationally-concentrated spatial structures\\n(see pp. 96-71 butgo on to investigate furtherthe social natureof\\nthe\\'unequal marketrelations\\' (p. 97) which holdthemtogether and\\nlink them intoa widereconomy . On the one handthe real social\\ncontentoftherelations which bind together the firms \\'within\\'the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 339\\ndistricts could be elaborated to teaseoutthepowerrelations which\\nstructure them internally. On the otherhand the very different\\npowerrelations whichconstruct theirconnection to the world\\neconomy, linking these place-based constellations tointernationa\\xad\\nlisedspatialstructures characterised by bothspatialreach and great\\npotential geographical flexibility emphasise the inherent vulner\\xad\\nabilityofsomeofthese areas. In outlining thatexample, I had in\\nmind some oftheindustrial districts said to characterise \\'the third\\nItaly\\'. But the City ofLondon has also been characterised as an\\nindustrial district, based on finance. If it isto be so characterised\\nthen itsnature,in termsofthe social relations whichconstruct it, is\\nvery different. The structure ofpowerrelations contrasts dramati\\xad\\ncally with thatofthethirdItaly.Internally there has been a strong\\ncohesion, imposed by the dominating powerofthemajorplayers\\nincluding most particularly the Bank ofEngland (although more\\nrecently the shifting statusof the area in relation to the global\\neconomy has broughtsomeofthoseold-established linesofcontrol\\nmore into question) . Thiscoherence-in-dominance is verydifferent\\nfrom what seems to be the mixture of coherence andanarchywhich\\ncharacterises other,small-firm based, districts. Moreover, thepower\\nstructure oftherelations beyond the district is equally distinct.\\nInsteadofbeinganxious to gain access to the dominant spatial\\nstructures ofthe world economy, the City ofLondonis the home\\xad\\nbase for some ofthosestructures. Both its strengths and its\\npotential vulnerabilities are very different. Extending the kind of\\nanalysis suggested in the preceding chapters forintra-firmrelations\\nto all the varied kinds of economic relations, especially including\\nthose between firms, would give a much fuller, and more complex\\nandinternally disintegrated and possibly contradictory, pictureof\\nspatialdivisions oflabour.\\nA concludingnote on spatial structures\\nInSpatial Divisions ofLabour, famously, three different spatial\\nstructures ofproduction are used to illustrate theapproach to\\nanalysis. These are characterised assingle-region, cloning, and\\npart-process . Asbroadforms, they are also arguedto have been\\nimportant instructuring thespatialdivisions oflabourat different\\nperiods within the United Kingdom. Aftera decade of discussion\\nand useoftheseconcepts it isperhapsworth clarifying one or two\\npoints. Most basically, all these three are spatialstructures, which 340 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmay form partof spatial divisions of labour. Because I argued that\\nthepart-process spatialstructure may have been becoming particu\\xad\\nlarlyimportant in\\'structuring the geography of the UK,much of the\\nfocus of subsequent work by others has been on thatparticular\\nstructure, In the extreme, the part-process spatialstructure came to\\nbe seen as thespatialstructure, and even as thespatial division of\\nlabour.Moreover its form became frozen. This is not what was\\nintended. All three of these spatial structures may be the bases for\\nspatialdivisions oflabour,in the sense of being of particular\\nimportance in individual places or periods. But more than this,\\nfor reasons which probably vary, from my own terminological\\ninexactitude (particularly regarding the notionof\\'archetype\\') to\\nthe factthatit isan easier interpretation than the one I had in mind,\\nthese three spatial structures have sometimes been read as (i) the\\nonly three structures which could possibly exist, (ii) full specifica\\xad\\ntionsofactualstructures, and/or(iii) formulae which one can rush\\nout and search for in one\\'s next empirical study. This is again not\\nwhat was intended! Indeed the opening discussion cautions against\\nanyapproach which identifies a particular empirical form and holds\\nit up to be universal (p. 67). On the contrary, what the approach\\nthroughspatialstructures tries to do \\'is to recognise from the start\\nthe existenceand importance of variety. It attempts to formulate an\\napproach toconceptualising and examining the apparently endless\\nadaptability and flexibility ofcapital\\'(p. 67): to do otherwise is to\\ndisarm ourselves. The spatialstructures attempt to do this by\\ndemonstrating \\'dimensions ofpotential variation. They do not\\nexhaustthatpotential. They represent three out of many ways in\\nwhich the relations of production can be organised over space\\'\\n(p.67).\\nThis is so in a numberof ways. First, the types as specified are\\nextremely simple, and need in any particular case to be more clearly\\nset out (see pp. 73-4). Second, within each broad type or class of\\nspatialstructure widevariations in detail may be found which it\\nmight be important to specify (pp. 73-7). Third,there are endless\\npossibilities ofcompletely different forms of spatial structure. Some\\nof these are spelled outbriefly in the book (pp. 73-4 and 105, for\\ninstance). Some very interesting work by a group of geographers at\\nSouthampton, in the 1980s,analysed the specificityof the structures\\nin which important sectors of their region were set (Pinch, Mason\\nand Witt, 1989; Mason, Pinch and Witt, 1991)and other examples\\nare alluded to in Allen (1988), Massey, Quintas, Wield (1992), Reflections on Debates over a Decade 341\\nMassey (1988) and in the research at Bristol on the financial sector\\n(see, for instance, Leyshon, ThriftandTwommey , 1988).\\nInOctober 1991therewas astrikeat thecar-production\\ncompany Renault. Thestrikewasconcentrated at oneplant,at\\nCleonjustwestofParis. But its effects spreadrapidlythroughthe\\ncompany more widely. The reason for this, and for the strength\\nthus made evident on the partofthestrikers,wasanalysed (though\\nnot in these terms) in an articlein theThe Financial Times\\n(Dawkins, 1991).Itlaydirectly in thespatialstructure of\\nproduction which had been adopted by thecompany. Itwas a\\npart-process structure but with two crucial features. First,it did not\\nhavemulti-sourcing : inRenaulta very high percentage ofengines\\nand gearboxes were sourced from this one plantat Cleon (Dawkins ,\\n1991). Second, the company had recently adopted ajust-in-time\\nmethod,reducing capital requirements greatly, but also on the other\\nhandmakingmore tight and vulnerable the links between different\\nplantsin thespatialstructure .\\'Therisk, asRenaulthas found, is\\nthatone supply blockage can quickly bring the whole company to\\nits knees. Fordsuffered for the same reason in 1988when a strike in\\nBritaindisrupted production in Belgium and Germany\\' (Dawkins,\\n1991). In otherwords, slight modifications in the form ofspatial\\nstructure turnedwhat can often be the difficulties posed for unions\\nbypart-process structures into anadvantage .Itisimportant to be\\nalert to the endless flexibility (in the sense ofspecificity) ofcapital,\\nto be aware thatits strategies are not always guaranteed success,\\nthatthey are always contestable. Spatialorganisation is both a\\nstakeand a weapon in the variouspower struggles in society, not\\nleast in the geography ofindustry.\\n8.5Genderandfeminism\\nSpatial Divisions ofLabour,in its first edition, was not a book\\nwritten within what was at thattime defined as the field offeminist\\ngeography. Thatis to say, in the terms ofthecontemporary\\ndefinition ofthatfield (which is different from the way in which\\nit would be defined today), it is neitherparticularly concerned with\\nwomennorcentrally focused on gender relations. In terms ofits\\nsubjectmatterit was, on the contrary, trying to addressoneofwhat\\nJane Jenson ironically calls \\'thebigquestions tackled by the big\\nboys\\' (Jenson, 1990, pp. 59 and 60). This is a formulation utterly 342SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nlacking in any strictcriteriaofdefinition, and yet we know - or at\\nleast a good many ofus know - exactly what she means. In the early\\n1980s, and perhapsstilltoday,industrial geography and regional\\nunevendevelopment were precisely such questions .\\nThis clearly does not mean, however, thatthe topic is immune to\\nfeminist treatment (indeedtodaymyposition wouldprobably be\\nthatit is precisely some ofthe\\'big-boys issues\\'thatare most\\nurgently in needoffeminist critique). And there was constructive\\ndebateaboutthebook\\'srelationship to feminism in the years\\nfollowing its publication (see especially, for a constructive and\\ninsightful consideration ofthe issues, Bowlby, FoordandMcDo\\xad\\nwell, 1986; also Huxley, 1989, Johnson, 1989, and Walker, 1989,\\n[Massey, 1989provides a briefdebatewith these last three pieces];\\nand Rose, 1993, provides a contextual ising review ofthebookand\\nofthe response to it within feminist geographyj.\\'\\nRecapitulation ofthemes\\nNonethe less, in SpatialDivisionsofLabourI didattemptto tackle\\nthe issues as a feminist, thoughone who was in those days more\\npolitically engaged thantheoretically sophisticated. Issuesof\\n\\'gender\\', in one way or another, runthrough thebook. These\\nrange in tone and contentfrom ironic asides aboutthe domestic\\nincompetence, andtherefore dependency, of young men from the\\nsouthofItaly (Section 3.2, Some issues, p. 84) to more general\\npolitical reflections on how racism and sexism, and the construc\\xad\\ntionsofrace and gender, divide the working class (Section 2.3, A\\nframework, pp.33--4)and how the sexism of male workers (thatis,\\nthe cause of thatdivision within the working class) can bring about\\ntheirownandwiderdefeats(Section 6.3,Socialandspatial\\nrestructuring in theworking class, p. 284).\\nHowever, the ways in which issues of gender are most consis\\xad\\ntently woven into the argument are those which revolve aroundthe\\nbook\\'score themes. Since in the preceding chapters these issues are\\nembedded inparticular analyses,itisperhapsagain worth pulling\\noutsomeofthe main threads. Most clearly, there is a focus on\\ndivisions oflabour,mostparticularly the division oflabourin paid\\nwork, and their relationship to gender. Throughout, there is an\\ninsistence thatnoneofthese things is simply \\'natural\\'. On the\\ncontrary, they are socially constructed. Inparticular, the social\\nallocation ofdifferent socialgroups,in this case men and women, Reflections on Debates over a Decade 343\\ntoparticular places in the economic division oflabourcannotbe\\nexplained by the natureofthelabourprocess, the requirements of\\ntechnology, or any oftheotherproduction-deterministic variations\\nwhich are so frequently cal1edupon to play this role. Rathersuch\\nsocial al1ocation (and the subsequent societalvaluation ofthejobs\\ninquestion) ispartand parcel of(thatis to say, bothan effect of,\\nand actively implicated in the process of) the social construction of\\ngender. The historical study ofthefootwear industry stresses the\\ntotal lack ofa basis in production for the sexual division oflabour\\nwhich has been consolidated over thecenturies inthatindustry. The\\nstudyofelectronics refuses to take for granted what was then\\nusual1yasserted to be women\\'s naturalability at \\'detailed fiddly\\njobs\\' (Section 4.2·,Labouras a\\'location factor\\':a social process,\\np. 135), and comparisons ofcars and electronics (Section 3.3,\\nSpatialstructures and social structures, p.III)amonganumber\\nofotherexamples make the same point,and it is not one which is\\nnowparticularly controversial.\\nIndeed, both theoretical and empirical research now indicate that\\nthe setofinterlocking relations and processes is far more complex\\nthan isindicated in the preceding chapters. Inparticular , while\\nSpatialDivisionsofLabourtalksofthe divisions of race and gender\\nbeing\\'constructed as much outsideas within the workforce\\' (p. 34)\\nit in fact places most ofits reliance for the construction of gender\\non\\'widersociety\\' invarious guises,andpaysrelatively little\\nattention to the powerful forces for such construction which can\\nequally be found within the workplace . Where it does, however,\\ndwellon the ways in which paid work, and the social interpretations\\nput upon it, can actively participate in theformation ofparticular\\ngendercategories/characteristics, it isperhapsmore likely to talk\\nabouttheconstruction of masculinity than femininity. Thus, the\\ndiscussion ofthedefinition ofskills in the clothingindustry reflects\\non the struggles ofaparticular groupofmen to preserve their\\nthreatened masculinity (Section 4.3, Spatialstructures ofbig firms,\\np. 161);most obviously, the exploration ofemployment changes in\\nmining areas points out how a centralstake in what was at issue in\\nthose years was a specific (time -spacespecific) characterisation of\\nmasculinity formed very much in relationto aparticular kindof\\nwork in a particular sector - the sexismwhich was integral in it, the\\nbewilderment and even pain with which manymen met the\\nchal1enge to it, the self-defeating divisiveness which it represented\\nwithin the working class. At least it makes the pointthatmen and 344 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nmasculinity are - or shouldbe - as much an issue for feminist, or\\ngender-aware (better:gender-challenging), geography as are women\\nand femininity.\\nFurther, and moving beyond the constellation of issues around\\ndivisions of labourspecifically, there is a concern to argue that, and\\ntoillustrate the variety of ways in which, the social relations of\\nproduction and of gender (in anotherterminology, capitalism and\\npatriarchy) articulate with and mutually inflect each other. The\\nmostobvious andsustained case here is the comparison in\\nChapter 5 between the coalfield areas and Cornwall. Thecompar\\xad\\nison of \\'the pre-existing structures\\' as well as ofthesubsequent\\n\\'combination of layers\\' in these very different areas is in part\\nconcerned tounderscore how in each there is an articulation of\\nspatialform, with the social relations ofandaroundproduction ,\\nand with the constructed form of gender relations (seeperhapsin\\nparticular Section 5.3, A different kind of \\'periphery\\': the case of\\nCornwall). A ratherdifferent instance is thatof the variety of ways\\nin which gender is a significant axis in the formation ofspatial\\nstructures ofproduction (Section 3.3, Spatial structures and social\\nstructures, p. 112, and Section 4.3, Spatialstructures of big firms,\\npp.161-2).Whatsuchcases do is to carry into this particular field\\nthe more general themes of (i) thinking in terms of articulation , and\\nspecifically (ii) articulation between class-related and othersocial\\nrelations in (iii) the production of (spatially) varied outcomes.\\nItis,moreover , precisely the fact thatthis really is articulation\\n(and not the adding-in of some consideration from one arenato a\\nstorywhich is really aboutanother) whichenables amutual\\ninfluencing of the relations in play. Thus the study of the shoe\\nindustryanalyses the impact which the embedded sexual division of\\nlabourhashadon the degree oforganisation of thelabour\\nmovement, on technological change and on the locational strate\\xad\\ngiesof capital within the sector (Section 3.2, An example, pp. 90-6).\\nIn themid-nineteenth centuryit was precisely a combination of\\nchanges in the organisation ofproduction with \\'the stubbornly\\nunchanging relations between the sexes\\' which accelerated the\\nprocess of urbanisation in the East Midlands region. In later years\\nthecombination of sexual divisions of labourbothwithin paid\\nwork and more widely, the potential for technical change and the\\nconstantly shifting surfaces of locational possibilities (themselves, in\\nrelation to labour,exhibiting significant gender differences) were\\ntogether involved in producing the beginnings of a new spatial Reflections on Debates over a Decade 345\\nstructure (see Section 4.3, Spatialstructures ofbig firms, pp. 162\\xad\\n4). In the overall story ofthegeography ofthefootwear industry,\\nthen, a whole set ofsocialrelations and social practices is involved:\\nthenatureofcapitalin the sector, technical change, the sexual\\ndivisionoflabouroutsideofpaid work, the natureoftherelations\\nofproduction , the sexual division oflabourwithin work, the\\nlocational strategies offirms, and the impactofplace and ofthe\\nexternally changing geography ofsocialrelations, especially the\\nlocational strategies ofothersectors.Genderisimplicated in this\\nstorythroughout: its verydefinition and theorganisation of gender\\nrelations within and beyond paid work are bothmoulded inrelation\\nto and have their own impactupon all the otherelements in the\\nunfolding story. Or again, a combination ofprevailing ideologies of\\ngender with the place in the economy ofdifferent sectorsof\\nproduction isarguedto have been influential in thepolitical\\ndetermination of thegeographical areas which would beassigned\\nregional policy assistance (Section 4.1, The inheritance : social and\\nspatial,pp.126-7).\\nIn this sense then gender isessential to the empirical story told in\\nthebook. At a micro level it is a crucial axis in the formation of\\nspatialstructures in anumberofpartsofindustry. Morebroadly, it\\nis an essential component in any serious understanding ofthe\\norganisation andreorganisation of British economic space over the\\nperiod in question. Aseconomic policy and political strategyunder\\nWilsonenabled theemergence on to the labourmarket in\\nDevelopment Areas of a particular kind of female labour, itself\\nconstructed in aparticular and locally-specific field ofgender\\nrelations, so in some ofthe big cities, and most especially in\\nLondon, acombination of increasing international competition\\n(from the exploitation ofwomen in the ThirdWorld)and the\\nincreasing demandfor female workers in the growing service sectors\\nmeantthatanothergroupof women - young, usually childless \\xad\\nwas coming to be in very shortsupply. Some ofthecompanies\\nsqueezed in this pincer went \\'north\\'to the coalfields, or to the West\\nCountry - moving from one changing labourmarketfor women to\\nanother.Othercompanies went lessfar, sometimes shiftingto areas\\nlike the East Midlands and thus disrupting yetanother labour\\nmarkethighlystructured on gender lines, and expelling existing\\nemployers to yet more \\'peripheral\\' areas.\\nBoth gender and geography, therefore, wereintegral to the\\nrecomposition ofemployment over this period,and gender was 346 Spatial Divisions ofLabour\\nintegral to the geographical reorganisation which took place. This\\nwas so in two ways. Both geographical differences in systems of\\ngender relations and differences between distinct groups ofwomen\\nwereimportant. The clearest example of the first, in this particular\\nstory, is the creation ofpotential labour-forces withparticular\\ncharacteristics, out of the gender relations of Cornwall and the\\ncoalfields. But the second aspect - differences among women, and\\ntheirhighly specific and distinct characteristics - isequally\\nimportant in itsarticulation with the shifting economic geography\\nof this period. The \\'younggirls\\' of the capital, not \\'yet\\'married\\n(labourmarketliterature seemsalways to assume thatmarriage will\\nbe their fate) and certainly without children, left the dismal\\nconditions of the footwear industry in droves - or, more likely,\\njustdidn\\'tgo into it on leaving school. Instead they took up their\\nplaces- as secretaries, receptionists, clerks and typists - at the heart\\nof the new emergence ofLondonas a world city. Deprived of this\\nlabourforce the footwear industryboth shifted locationandsought\\nout a different group of women. This time the industry sought out\\nwomen who were not cheap because they were assumed only to be\\nin this job for a while, until they \\'settled down\\',but cheap because\\nnow they were (assumed to be) married, with otherfunctions and\\ninterests as their prime concern and pressing constraints on their\\nability to search a wider field for more remunerative employment.\\nThe women of the coalfields weredifferent again, valued in the first\\nplace primarily for their supposed \\'greenness\\'. Women as labour\\npower, in this case as a result of the distinct modes oftheir insertion\\ninto(patriarchal) social relations, are a highly varied group.\\nGillian Rose (1993)has recently suggested that\\'marxists examine\\nthe uneven development of capitalist production, feminists focus on\\ntherelationship between production andreproduction aspartof\\ncapitalist patriarchy\\' (p. 113).Whatever is actually the case, such a\\ndivision of labourmust weaken the arguments of both streams of\\nthought. Not only are the categories (production/reproduction)\\nthemselves open to re-examination, but feminist (and marxist)\\nanalyses each have a contribution to make in a wider spectrum of\\nfieldsthan this\\'.In particular, as the next section reflectsand as Rose\\ndemonstrates , feminism has much to say in the sphere of modes of\\ntheorising and of conceptualisation . However, the reason Rose pulls\\nout thiscontrastisto highlight a tendency within feminist geography\\ntoemphasise \\'women\\'s diverseexperiences ofproduction and\\nwomen\\'s shared experience of reproduction in thecontextof the Reflections on Debates over a Decade 347\\nWestern City\\'(p. 116), to assume\\'thesimilarity ofwomendue to\\ntheirsharedexperience ofreproductive workandtheirdiversity due\\ntodifferent experiences ofunevenproduction relations\\' (pp. 121-2).\\nThisis anassumption which is unwarranted, as Rosepointsout.It\\nunderestimates thedifferences amongwomenin thesphereof\\nreproduction, mostparticularly alonglinesofsexuality andethni\\xad\\ncity, as well as ofclass.Moreover, there is a furtherpoint.Forthe\\ndifferences amongwomen in the sphereofproduction which are\\nmostoftenstressedare those of(sociological) class:middleclass as\\nopposed toworking class,andsoforth.Whattheanalyses in the\\npreceding chapters show,however, isthatthis is by no meansthe\\nonly form ofdifferentiation amongwomenin thissphere. Also\\nimportant, not only in differentiating amongwomenbutalso in\\nsettingthemagainsteachotherin termsofimmediate interests in the\\nlabourmarketandinrelationtocapital,arethemorecomplex and\\nmultifarious aspectsofwhatare called abovetheirdistinctmodesof\\ninsertion intothe social relations ofpatriarchy .\\nFinally, sincemuchofwhatwas going on between the sixties and\\ntheeightieswas ashiftingsetofstrategies on thepartofBritish\\nindustry (andofthe British government inrelation to theBritish\\neconomy) to try to becomemoreinternationally competitive, so it\\ncan beunderstood thatsuchstrategies were actively usingspatial\\ndifferences ingenderrelations andbetween groupsofwomenin\\ntheirattempts to getoutofwhathasbecome theseemingly\\nperpetual weakness ofthe British economy.\\nAconsciousness ofthisgenderelement inthestoryalso\\ninfluences anyevaluation oftheregional policyoftheperiod.In\\nthe early days (andto anunfortunate extentstilltoday)such\\nevaluation wascarriedoutthrough thecorrelation ofthetiming\\nand sizeofthedecentralisation ofemployment with the timingand\\ngeographical distribution ofregional-policy incentives . It was a\\nclassic case ofthe\\'correlation-between-maps\\' approach referred to\\ninChapter 2. When a high correlation wasfoundbetween these two\\nphenomena, it wasdeduced thatthey were causally relatedand\\nmoreover (though this was by no meansshownby thestatistics\\nthemselves) thatregional policy was the causeofthedecentralisa\\xad\\ntion. On this reading, regional policyemerged ashavingbeenquite\\nsuccessful. Thedetailed,period-by-period analyses inChapter 6\\n(Section 6.2, Uneven development andnational politics) presenta\\nrangeofbothmethodological andsubstantive arguments to\\ndemonstrate theinadequacy ofthisapproach. Running through 348SpatialDivisions ofLabour\\nthesearguments, andthroughthedebatewhichtookplace over the\\nperiodaboutthe effectiveness of regional policy, was a threadof\\nargument concerning gender.\\nThe original, regression-based ,evaluations had paid no attention\\nto gender. But it was not long before complaints from the regions\\xad\\nfrom trade unionists and otherspokesmen - made clear thatthe\\njobswhich were arriving were not of the kind which hadbeen\\nexpected: they were \\'forwomen\\'. A revised evaluation of regional\\npolicy emerged, more mutedin its claims for success. In its overtly\\nsexist version this evaluation objected thatthe incoming jobswere\\nnotfor thenewly-unemployed, thatthey were \\'only\\' for women.\\nThe more respectable version implicitly carried the same message,\\narguing thatthe fact thatthe new jobswere for women was\\nunfortunate in the sense that,because women\\'s jobstend to be\\nless well paid, part-time, less skilled . . . aggregate regional income\\nwould decline and everybody would suffer.\\nBut, of course, not everyone would suffer. To begin with, the\\nattractiveness tocapitalof thisparticular femaleworkforce resulted\\nprecisely from the construction over the years of the specificity of\\nthe local gender culture. To the extent, therefore, thatthe men of\\nthe region were implicated in the construction of thisculture,they\\nonly had themselves to blame. But fu rther,a largepartof the\\nemployment entering these regions over the period cannotbeput\\ndown entirely to the operation of regional policy. Chapter 6 spells\\nout some of the varied articulations of causes in which regional\\npolicy was to various degrees and in a variety of ways involved; but\\nalso involved was a shifting search by industry for new sources of\\nfemalelabour.So any claims for the successof regional policy have\\nto take such complexities into account. Working in theopposite\\ndirection, however, is the fact that,while certainly much ofthe new\\nemployment was low paid, part-time, designated as lowskilled, etc.,\\nit did none the less for the first time, and at the price of the double\\nshift, bring some independent income for a significant numberof\\nwomen in these partsof thecountry.Moreover, as the very fact of\\nthe initial complaints itself indicates, it began to disruptsome of\\nthose old gender relations. On this score, then, although not on\\nothers,regional policy can be seen to have had some quite positive\\neffects, but in a wholly different way from thatclaimed by those\\nwhoperformed the initial correlation-based evaluations .\\nSuchreinterpretations arearrivedat notjustbylooking at\\nwomen, but by investigating geographical variations in the con- Reflections on Debates over a Decade 349\\nstruction ofmasculinity and femininity, and the relations between\\nthe two. Moreover, the very focus on geographical variation insists\\non the fact thatwhat is at issue here is not some essentialism of\\n\\'men\\'and\\'women\\', but how people are (variously) constructed in\\nrelationto adistinction between masculinity and femininity.\\nA question ofconceptual approach\\nThesestrandsofthought concerning genderwerewritteninto\\nSpatialDivisions ofLabourfrom aposition which was self-con\\xad\\nsciously feminist. Were I writing it todaythey would be treated\\ndifferently and in more depth.Studying thebookagain now,\\nhowever, anotherthreademerges. Jane Jenson(1990) has written\\nabouthow, in her case, the form taken by her theoretical research,\\nandparticularly herinvention oftheconceptofpermeable Fordism,\\nwas made possible by her readingoffeministtheoretical work.That\\nis,although theconceptwas not designed as one within the field of\\ngender studies or even feminist theory, its form was influenced by its\\noriginator \\'sacquaintance with the latterbodyofwork.Something\\nsimilar may be the case with certainaspectsofSpatialDivisions of\\nLabour.Itisperhaps worthwhile reflecting on some intellectual\\nhistoryinorderto explore this point. But it must be stressed from\\nthestartthatthis isnotanattemptretrospectively to claim Spatial\\nDivisionsofLabourforfeminist geography. Thatisnotthepoint,\\neitherway.Ratherit seems valuable to reflect back on the book\\nnow, and most specifically on the natureof itstheorising , from a\\nfeminist perspective.\\nCentralto manyofthearguments inSpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nis thenotionofarticulation .Itiscrucial to the idea ofcausality and\\ncausalstructures, it is the basis ofthepostulated relationbetween\\nthe general and the particular, it is the means oflinking the global\\nand the local (the wider relations ofaspatialdivisionoflabour\\nimbricated in theparticularities ofplace), it is the means ofthinking\\nofaparticular formofemployment (ajob)at aparticular pointin\\nspace-time as theproductofsetsofrelations with otherpartsofthe\\nemployment structure ,relations themselves also stretched out to\\nformthattime-space.\\nItis difficult ever to be sure ofwhere and why particular ideas\\ncome to be important inone\\'smode of thinking. In the case of\\narticulation , however, it probably derived from, or was certainly\\nunderlined in significance by, my early readings ofworks in and 350SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\naroundMarxism. Itwas acombination ofThe German Ideology\\nand Louis Althusser which was the real spark.The German Ideology\\nwas oneofthe firstbooksI read within Marxism - this would be in\\nthe late sixties - and it posed problems for me. The reason it did so\\nwas the natureof itsruminations on the\\'essential\\' difference\\nbetween humanbeings and otheranimals.Itseemed to me to be\\naconcernwhich was not only unnecessary to aliberatory political\\nprojectbut one which was also likely to hamperany such projectby\\nthepotential essentialism ofthe way it was in practicetreated.For\\nalthough Marxand Engels in this work are quitescrupulous in their\\ntheoretical injunctions againstbothspiritual and biological essenti\\xad\\nalism(attacking these things is afterallpartofthepointofthe\\nwork)their own implementation ofthis leaves some questions.\\nHumanbeings are said to produce themselves by \\'labour\\', or at\\nleast this is the main emphasis, ratherthanby activity, experience\\nor, more generally, practice. Thereis a reference to the \\'large\\'\\nhistorical component inhumannature(mymarginal noteofmore\\nthantwenty five years ago says \\'total\\').Moreover , thenatureofthe\\nresidue implied in the text by the word \\'large\\'(i.e.nottotal)\\nbecomes clear as the analysis proceeds, and my marginal notes\\nbecome more anguished. Thereis reference to the \\'firsthistorical\\nact\\'as being the production ofthe means to satisfy the needs of\\neating,drinking, habitation andclothing.Thereis theapproach to\\nthehistorical development ofthe division oflabour,\\'whichwas\\noriginally nothing but the division oflabourin the sexual act\\'.\\nThereare thespecifications of the division ofsociety into \\'families\\',\\nandofthe division oflabourwithin the family, as \\'natural\\'. The\\npointhere is not to criticise the work,which was written at a\\nparticular time and with a particular aim in view (and indeed there\\nareambiguities even on the pointsmentioned above) so much as to\\nindicatethe effect on me ofareadingof it.Thereseemed to be a\\ndivision here between the large element ofhumannaturewhich was\\nhistorical and aremainder which was read as being priorto, and\\nthus even more worryingly perhapsexternalto,history.\" Moreover,\\nand this was the pointwhich exercised me most, if there was\\naccepted to be in these spheressomething called the essential\\nhumanbeing (i.e. in this formulation an aspect priortohistory)\\nthen any minutenow there would be the essential woman. To a\\nyoungfemale at the time determined toescapemanyofthe\\ncharacteristics usually held up as female, together with much of\\nwhatlifereputedly held instore-marriage, children, etc. - this was Reflections on Debates over a Decade 351\\nnot easy reading.Farfromliberation, it seemed like a trap.Itwas\\nAlthusser , with his ideas ofstructured causality (most especially\\n\\'Contradiction andOverdetermination\\') and his famous dictum\\nthat\\'thereis nopointofdeparture\\' (inotherwords,on myreading,\\nthere isnothingwhich you have to acceptaseternally pre-given,\\nwhich is not in itself a productofprevious causalstructures) who\\nprovided a welcome way out. Itisinteresting, in thiscontext, to\\nnotethatJaneJenson,intracingout her own trajectory, not only\\nrefers inparticular to the work of Nicos Poulantzas (p.65),but also\\nand most pointedly in thiscontextshe argues thatit was a political\\nanti-essentialism and aderived need to tacklethetheoretical\\nconstruction ofgenderrelations, which lay at the heartof her\\nstory. The springboard forlaunching into anexploration ofthese\\nwaysofthinking, sheargues, was the need to tackle\\'the\\nimplications of oneoftheoldestinstitutions ofthewomen\\'s\\nmovement ,that\"women are made, not born\"\\'. As she says \\'A\\nwidereadingofthis insight compels us to thinknotonlyaboutthe\\nsocialconstruction ofgenderrelations but also aboutthe ways in\\nwhichallsocialrelations areconstructed \\' (p. 60, emphasis in\\noriginal) and furtherthat\\'If my feminism made impossible any\\nassumptions thatclass was the primarycontradiction, mypersonal\\nexperience with the varieties ofwaysofbeing a womanand a\\nfeminist... made any resortto essentialism impossible . The only\\npossible conclusion wasthatrelations ofdifference mustbe asocial\\nconstruction, andI began to wonder how social relations of\\ndifference, reflecting inequities ofpower,cameintoexistence\\'\\n(p.65).10\\nThis, evidently, is to refer to only one type offeminism: that\\ndeveloped at a particular moment in specific social and theoretical\\ncontexts. By no means all varieties offeminism are in this sense\\nanti-essentialist andsome recent work has anywayproblematised\\nthedistinction between essentialism and (social) constructionism .\\nDianaFuss (1989), for instance, hasdemonstrated thefrequent\\nmutualdependence ofthe twoapproaches , andarguedin effectthat\\nneitherpositioncan be entirely pure.

Reflections on Debates over a Decade 353\\nBut if, for me, whatananti-essentialist position (even if it cannot\\nbe a\\'pure\\'one) has in the pastrepresented is anoptimism of\\nontological assumptions withparticular reference to feminism, it\\nhassubsequently beeninvested withotheradvantages, most\\nparticularly the way in which, through theconstant recognition of\\narticulation, itenables anapproach to thecontingencies and\\nuniquenesses, as well as the broadstructures, ofspace-time .\\nWithingeography therelational approach has been explicitly\\ntakenup bySusanHanson (1992),andoneofitsclearest\\nformulations is by the feminist writer DonnaHaraway. Haraway\\n(1991)arguesfor a politics of affinityratherthanofidentity(see,\\nforinstance, \\'Reading BuchiEmecheta\\' and\\'Manifesto for\\nCybergs\\') andat theheartofherdiscussions is arejection ofa\\nnature/culture dichotomy ofa type which sees natureas merely a\\nresource to be takenup byculture.Natureis in such formulations\\npre-given, apointofdeparture (topickup onAlthusser\\'s\\nformulation) andoneofthe forms in which it exists is as the\\nbody,andas sex in counterposition to(cultural) gender(see also\\nGrimshaw, 1986).Haraway, as anaturalscientist, abiologist,\\narguesagainstsuchformulations - and,interestingly enough, sees\\nThe German Ideology as \\'themajorlocus for Marx\\'andEngels\\'\\nnaturalisation ofthe sexual division of labour,intheirassumption\\nof apre-social division of labourin the sex act (heterosexual\\nintercourse), itssupposed natural corollaries inthereproduct ive\\nactivities of men andwomen in the family, and the consequent\\ninability to place women in their relations to menunambiguously\\non the side ofhistoryandofthe fully social ...Therootdifficulty\\nwas aninability tohistoricize sexitself; likenature,sexfunctioned\\nanalytically, as aprimematteror rawmaterial for the work of\\nhistory\\' (\\'\"Gender\" for aMarxist Dictionary\\', pp. 131-2). In\\nformulating a way of knowing which can escape such debilitating\\nlimitations, she argues that\\'Difference istheorized biologically as\\nsituational , notintrinsic,at every level fromgene to foraging\\npattern\\' andthat\\'bodiesas objects ofknowledge arematerial\\xad\\nsemiotic generative nodes.Theirboundaries materialize in social\\ninteraction. Boundaries aredrawnbymapping practices ;\"objects\"\\ndo not pre-exist as such. Objectsareboundary projects\\' (\\'Situated\\nknowledges\\', pp.200-1).\\nThis, then, is not a view which does away with all distinction\\nbetween naturalprocesses andsocialprocesses, although theyboth\\nhave to be apprehended socially. WhatHaraway may bepointing 354SpatialDivisionsofLabour\\nto is the possibility ofananti-essentialist theorising ofdifference\\nwithin the naturalfield as well as the social. Itis theassumption\\nthatdifference in natureisessentialist thatshe isattacking. The new\\ndebatesin biology are exploding thatoldnature/nurture dichotomy\\nnot(ornotonly) in the sense ofarguingthatthenaturalis also\\nsociallyapprehended but also - and to my mind at least equally\\nsignificantly - bydemonstrating thatenvironment (nurture) can\\nhave effects on organism (nature). In a passage which takes us back\\nto thecentraltheme, Ho (1988) has written \\'Organism and\\nenvironment engage in continual mutualtransformation byvirtue\\nof aninterconnectedness thatreticulates in space andtime\\' (p. 21).\\nThereisthen,here, in the similarities to ways ofthinking\\ndeveloped inpartin thecontextofthe women\\'s movement, a\\nconnection to the feminist theorising ofthe past decade.

Whether ornotcomponent production andassembly are\\nseparate branches ofproduction in this sense will depend,therefore ,\\nnot on some external characteristics ofthe twoprocesses , but on their\\nrelation to thestructure ofcapitalownership andthestructure of\\naccumulation.\\nItshouldbe saidthatthere has been considerable debateaboutthe\\nmeaning of\\'socialdivisionoflabour\\'.Thediscussion here is based on\\nCapital,vol. 1ch. xiv, section4.Marxis heremakinganassumption:\\n\\'onecommodity percapitalist\\' , which is empirically untenable today.\\nButneitherthis,northedisputeover the term \\'socialdivision of\\nlabour\\'matters here.Whatconcerns thepresentargument is the\\ndifference between marketrelations andcorporately-planned relations.\\nThis, again, marksthemoutasdefinitions specific to a capitalist\\neconomy .ItisworthquotingMarxagain, if only for his wry political\\ncomment s:\\nDivision oflabourwithintheworkshop implies the undisputed\\nauthority ofthecapitalist over men [sic],thatarebutpartsofa\\nmechanism thatbelongsto him.

Here thereisobviously adistinction to bemadebetween some ofthe\\nwork on corporate organisation andwhatmightbecalledmore Notes and References 359\\nstraightforward statistical analyses. It is the latterto which this point\\nmost clearly applies.Forthe former, whatis being suggested is more a\\nwayofconceptualising someofthedetailed results into a wider\\nframework .Manyofthe-ideas are similarto those in Dicken (1976),\\nforinstance, thoughit would not be suggested here thattheapproach\\nshouldbeconfined to the level oftheindividual firm, orthatthe prime\\ncauseshouldbe seen as managerial strategy.\\nChapter4: Some Changing SpatialStructures lnthe United Kingdom\\n1.Theinteraction ofall these factorsis discussed in Chapters 5 and 6.\\nForthemoment they are taken for granted- as the\\'location surface\\'\\nfacingindustry. In fact, as will be seen, this surfacewas being formed\\nat precisely the same time. Both sides ofthese new location factors\\nwere being constituted together.\\n2. This, ofcourse, ispre-eminently the case in the Free Production Zones\\noftheThirdWorld,the zones precisely functioning asareasin which,\\nunlike the rest ofthecountry, otherconditions areavailable to make it\\npossible to use the cheaplabourofsurrounding areas(seeFroebel,\\nHeinrichs andKreye, 1980).\\n3. This process ofchangeover is really an intersectoral phenomenon .\\'Old\\nmeansofproduction industries \\' - which would includethese middle\\nstages - were declining fast at this time (see also Chapter 6).\\n4. Even if they were, their effects, precisely because ofintranationality,\\nwould be different.\\n5. This argument appliesbothtoelectronics andtoinstruments . Like the\\nrest ofelectronics, mlh 354 has as a whole traditionally been heavily\\nconcentrated in theSouthEast, with an outlying centrein theNorth\\nWest. While much decentralisation toDevelopment Areashas\\noccurred in thesectoras a whole, the difficulties for small firms in\\nthis process are, as we shall argue, enormous .Oakeyin fact argues this\\nfor mlh 354 as a whole, but, as ever, there are differences within the\\nmlh. His arguments seem toapplyafortiorito the small firms in the\\nhigh-technology-based partofthesector- i.e. those being discussed\\nhere. In a numberofways,largerfirms may behavedifferently . In\\nparticular, they are more likely to introduce changes intechnology ,\\nand theadoption ofNC, and neo-Fordist labourprocesses may well\\nreduceskillrequirements sufficiently to enabledecentralisation\\n(Massey andMeegan, 1979;Perrons, 1979).Although suchtechniques\\nareapplicable tosmall-batch production, theirinstallation mayrequire\\nsignificant investment andtherefore at present be ruled out for many\\nsmall firms. Interestingly, oneofOakey\\'s case studieswhich involved\\nmovement to aDevelopment Area (the south-west) was of a larger\\nfirm (over 1,000workers) andone which did have a significant demand\\nfor semi-skilled labourpower. This demandwas easily satisfied, andit\\nwas mainly women who were employed (p. 279). The difficulties arose\\nas a result ofanattemptto relocatetheheadquarters.Thus,while\\'the\\naimofemploying a large number ofsemi-skilled predominantly 360 Notes and References\\nfemale, staff from the local area has been achieved\\', \\'criticism was\\nmade of the \"lack of intellectual, artistic and cultural entertainments\\nand lack of high-class shopping and civic amenities\" (questionnaire\\nresponse)\\' (p. 279). Even more forcefully, the major advantage and\\ndisadvantage of the (St Austell) location reflected this dichotomised\\nlabourdemand: \\'The major advantage gained from the new location\\nwas attested to be a \"cheaper and more stable labourforce\"\\n(questionnaire response). However, the main disadvantage was\\ndescribed as \"a period of sustained production and supply difficulties\\nwhich resulted from inadequate training and knowledge of new staff,\\nwhichso badly affectedsales,it wasexceptionallydifficult to recover\"\\n(questionnaire response)\\' (pp. 279-80). (Itis perhaps necessary to\\nstress that itischangesin location that are beingdiscussed. There are\\nlocally-owned firms in advanced electronics in both the north-east of\\nEngland and parts of Scotland, both established bases for such\\nactivity. The trends, however, are not in their favour.)\\n6. Someof thecausesof thisstempreciselyfrom measures adoptedbythe\\nGovernment \\'to make British industry more competitive\\'. Thus, the,\\nuse of incomes policies to hold down wages also means that people\\nhave less to spend, and some consumer-goods industries, such as\\nclothing, may suffer. This can happen both because people spend less\\noverall on clothing and because, with what they do spend, they may\\nput a higher premium on cheapness, and thus further encourage low\\xad\\ncost imports (NEDO, 1976).\\n7. The next section discussesthe serviceindustry. The decentralisation of\\nthis industry to the regions aroundthe south-east has also been an\\nimportant phenomenon and may have affectedcompetition for labour\\ninregionssuchas theeastmidlands. Certainly theshoeindustry inthat\\nregion suffered from increased competition for women workers over\\nthe sixties and seventies, in a few cases prompting a shift to\\nDevelopment Areas such as the Northern Region (see Massey and\\nMeegan, 1982; and Mounfield, Unwin and Guy, 1982, p. 192).\\n8. This difference relates to the sexual division of labour in the industry\\nand theparticular relevance of PBR systems in machining, which is\\nmainly done by women. While of all employeesin the industry about\\n50per cent are on someform of payment-by-results (PBR)system,this\\nproportion rises to between 55 and 60 per cent for women (Clothing\\nEDC,1972).The importance of PBR relates to the nature of the\\nlabourprocess in the industry. Technologically, the speed of\\nproduction can still be controlled by the individual worker, especially\\ninmachining, and speedhas therefore to bemaintained byamixture of\\nexhortation , incentiveand threat (seeMassey and Meegan, 1982).\\n9.\\'Unfortunately managements\\' efforts to deskilloperations bring other\\nproblems, related to job-satisfaction and the need for adequate\\ncompensation ... which are likely to cause increasing concern in the\\nnext fewyears\\' (NEDO, 1974a,p. 48).\\n10. The NEDO Reviewto 1977refersto this practice, and to some of the\\n\\'difficulties\\' itcan cause Notes and References 361\\nMigratory labour,particularly from those countries which have\\nspecial links with the EEC, may provide a new source of employees\\nfor the UK clothing industryas they already have in Germany. Such\\nlabour,particularly if employed by smaller establishments , would\\npose problems with regard to adequate supervision of their social\\nand working conditions (NEOO, 1974a, p. 48).\\nII. There wasalso, of course, an even larger reserveof cheap labourin the\\nThirdWorld and a number of the largest companies switched\\ninvestment abroad,thus further accelerating the problem ofimports\\n(NEOO, 1977,p. 54).\\n12. The aggregate figures show a high percentage of male employees in\\nLondon, but such figures conceal too many otherdifferences to allow\\nof confident inference.\\n13. Care must betaken beforegeneralisingor extrapolating thispoint. Not\\nall small firms in these sectors are in competition with larger. They\\noften servedifferent markets. What is being described here is the clear\\npartition into two groups ratherthan the startof a process of\\nextinction of small capital. Indeed, there is evidence in the 1970sof\\nhigher closure rates among multiples (medium sized) firms.\\n14. Or from 68.6 per cent to 72.9 per cent if Transport andCommun ica\\xad\\ntion are excluded as being more properly classified as production\\nindustries.\\nIS. Some of whom also - those in legalservices,for example - have their\\npre-capitalist bases, of course (see Lipietz, 1978),but who are not at\\npresentthreatened by \\'more capitalist\\' forms of organisation.\\n16. See also \\'Small firms . . . in the South East ofEngland\\' by Brimson,\\nMassey, Meegan, Minns and Whitfield (1980).\\n17. The same applies to wholesale distribution .\\n18. We are dealing here with employment, i.e. the production of the\\nservicesratherthan the levelof their provision. Dataon thelatterare\\nproduced e.g. inSocial Trends (CSO),although in examining levelsof\\nprovision the regional level is probably not the most - or the only \\xad\\nappropriate one.\\n19. The employment effects of these parts of the public sector are very\\ndifferent from those of the central State. The latter is not only\\nprimarilyconcentrated on London but in its recent moves, now\\ncurtailed, towards geographical decentralisation it hasreproduced and\\nthus reinforced the patternofregional social differentiation. Ithas\\nbeen most importantly the lower levelfunctions, and especiallyroutine\\nclerical jobs, which have been decentralised, These central State\\nfunctions, of course, include also some consumer services.\\n20. This is the point made by Mills and Lav (1964) in their critique of\\nLosch, for assuming bothprivate capitalist ownership and total\\ncoverage ofthe area/population .Marquand writes\\nAlthough consumer services are widely dispersed, there is consider\\xad\\nablevariation between MELAs in their endowment with them. The 362NotesandReferences\\nvariations are sufficientlywide to make it clear thatit isunjustifiable\\nto assume thatthemarketwilloperatetodistribute consumer\\nservices (relatively) evenly in relation to population, orpopulation\\nand size of urban centre (para. 4.64).\\n21. Cuts in public expenditure have in fact been reducing the rateof\\ngrowthin these sectors since 1975 (Marquand, 1979,para. 1.18).\\n22. The same authorspoint out elsewherethat these factors are reinforced\\nby State intervention in industry.\\n23. This, ofcourse, isthe corollary of the lack of servicelinksfrom branch\\nplants, noted by Marquand (1979).\\n24. One very important aspect of this process is the relative decline of\\nLondonand the relative gains in the rest of the south-east.\\nChapter 5: The Effects on Local Areas: Class and Gender Relations\\nI. This coherence and simplicity ofeconomic structure was not confined\\nto mining towns. Humphrys (1972) writes of the tinplate towns of\\nsouth Wales: \\'in all these towns there was a direct and simple\\nrelationship between industry and community\\' (p. 23).\\n2. All this is comparative, with other industries and other kinds of\\ncommunity. There certainly are bases for sectionalism within mining.\\nThere are winding-enginemen, colliers, craftsmen and so on, and the\\nhistory of union organisation within the industry has often revolved\\nabouttheirinterrelation (Francis and Smith, 1980;Unofficial Reform\\nCommittee, 1912).But the relative homogeneity of the coal industry is\\nnone the lessclear, evenin comparison with theotherbasicindustries \\xad\\nsuchassteel- in the wider regions (Cooke, 198Ib).\\n3. Carney, Lewis and Hudson (1977) refer to this history in the north\\xad\\neast, and Francis and Smith (1980)document the history ofthe miners\\'\\nunion in south Wales in the twentieth century. There have been\\nconsiderable differences between regions, however; south Wales and\\nScotland have historically been far more militant than the north-east.\\n4. Even this process has not been smooth. By the end of the 1970s,\\ndeepening recession was causing losses of jobs in the new industries\\ntoo.Chapter6 looks at this variation over the period.\\n5. Which is not to deny that the geographical location of control has\\neffects- see Chapter3, and later in this chapter.\\n6. These kinds ofchanges apply not just to the range of incoming sectors\\nwhich are being mainly considered here, but also to others, such as the\\ncar industry.\\n7. External orientation isnot newto these areas, of course.The export of\\ncoal involved precisely that. But the direction of orientation, the\\nfunctions it performed and the markets it served, and the degree of\\nintraregional linkage it allowed, have all changed.\\n8. This sorting-process has, of course,also beencommented on byothers\\nin relation to the new towns of the South East. Notes and References 363\\n9. Neither is it without its parallels in the coalfield regions. There the\\nsources of alternative income are State transferpayments of various\\nsorts - including redundancy pay, miners\\' pensions and forms of EC\\nand ECSC income maintenance (mostly in steel areas). These are all\\ntemporary. Longer-lasting but at lower levelsis unemployment benefit,\\na form of State transfer which, in a \\'standard married couple\\'\\nsituation, is far more likely to cheapen female wages than male (since\\nmore men are eligible for unemployment benefit). These factors are\\nsmall, but not insignificant. Similar situations occur on a ratherlarger\\nscale in Ireland (Stanton, 1979)and Southern Italy (Wade, 1979).\\n10. Much of the information here is drawn from the CountyStructure\\nPlan and associated documents - Cornwall CountyCouncil, (1976a\\nand 1976b).\\nII. Ifthere isany wider connection here, it would reinforce the point made\\ninChapter4 that it might be easier for RandD workers and related\\nprofessionals to operatetheir residential preferences than it is for\\nmanagers and owners of capital.\\n12.Thestudyalso implies, ofcourse,thatalthough apleasant\\nenvironment may have helped, it would not have been sufficient to\\nrescue the coalfields. Of course, all that is being referred to here is\\nphysical environment. Cornwall still lacks the range of cultural\\namenities which seem to be a necessary condition forattracting top\\nmanagement, RandD personnel, etc. (see Chapter3).\\nChapter 6: Class, Politics and the Geography of Employment\\nI.Regional policy is by no means, obviously, the only arm of policy to\\nhave a regional dimension .Almost all policies have spatially\\xad\\ndifferentiated effects, and some sectoral ones very much so.\\n2. This difference was to become very obvious from their contrasting\\nresponses to cuts in regional policy.\\n3. The repercussions ofthis period were felt throughout the I970s. In\\n1977 at C.A. Parsons on Tyneside the power engineering workers\\nprevented the completion oftherestructuring ofpower engineering\\nbegun under the IRC, fighting off a combination of the NEB, much of\\ntheLabourGovernment - and Arnold Weinstock (see Coventry,\\nLiverpool, Newcastle and NorthTyneside TradesCouncils, 1980).\\n4. The exception in the United Kingdom to this general decline was of\\ncourseNorthSea oil, where again the regional effects weresignificant.\\nMoore, Rhodes and Tyler (1977) estimated it had generated some\\n20000 jobs in Scotland by 1976.\\n5. The criticism of location theory for being concerned only with\\ngeographical distribution does not mean thattheproblem of\\ndistribution , at a political as well as theoretical level, does not exist,\\nbut that it cannotbeadequately explained, nor adequately attacked,\\nwithout relating it to prior quotations aboutproduction . 364 Notes and References\\n6.Datafor these individual periods is inevitably all rathersparse. The\\nten-year census period bears no relation to a politico-economic\\nperiodisation.\\n7. In all cases except one (General Management in Wales) the overall\\ndeficits in these occupational groups in the North,in Scotland and in\\nWales were greater than could be \\'accounted for\\' by sectoral changes\\nwithin the regions and occupational changenationally within the\\nsectors (Kirwan, 1981)- a clear indication of the possible existence of\\nhierarchical spatial structures .\\n8. What would beinteresting would be to investigate the components of\\nthis relative loss. Kirwan\\'s (1981)analysis indicates that whilenational\\nchanges in occupational structure byindustrywould have indicated an\\nincrease in femaleassembly work in the Development Areas, the areas\\'\\nown changes in industrial structure would imply a considerable\\ndecline. The specifically regional residual component, though small,\\ndid not show such biglossesand in Scotland it actually increased.Such\\nan analysis of numerical components cannotlead to an explanation in\\nterms of process. But the patternto which it points, and which could\\nbe investigated, is that there was a greater closure rate of\\'cloned\\'\\nbranch plants - such as in clothing - than of branches at the bottom\\nends of production hierarchies. Certainly, in all the industrial\\nDevelopment Areas the regional component of the 1980 distribution\\nremains firmly positive.\\n9. In all cases, moreover, this increase was indicated by both industrial\\nstructure and regional factors. Again, this was a contrast with the\\nregionsofthe south and east where in each case while industrial\\nstructure indicated an increase, the residual regional component was\\nnegative.\\n10. These electoral characteristics are drawn from an analysis of both\\nopinion pollsand election results in Kellner, 1979.Analysis ofthe 1983\\nelection reveals many of the same trends (Massey, 1983).\\nII.Examination evenofsimplepatterns of voting behaviour makes the\\npoint clearly. Forthe whole period from the sixties to the eighties\\nvotingbehaviour in general elections varied noticeably by region. In\\nsome elections,such as that of 1964, the \\'influence\\' ofregion on social\\xad\\nclass voting patternswas greater than variations due to inter-regional\\ndifferences in class structure (Butler and Stokes, 1975). Forthe 1970\\nelection Butler and Stokes (\\\\975) compared precisely the two kinds of\\nareas examined in Chapter5- mining seatsand resort areas.Table A.I\\nreproduces their breakdown of classcomposition , byoccupational\\ngrade, in the two kinds of constituencies, and the results of their\\ninquiry as to \\'class self-image\\'.The difference between the two kinds of\\narea on both counts- and on the relation between the two - is clear.\\nThere is a wide difference in social structure between the two kinds of\\nconstituency , but this is not enough to account for voting differences:\\n\\'the much more spectacular difference has to do with the behaviour of\\nthe classes. The Conservatives actually outranLabouramong the\\nworking class ofresort areas . . . In the mining seats, however, the\\npicture is almostreversed.

In all these cases, of course, the rhetoricwas again tougherthan the\\naction. Subsidies to nationalised industries (the NCB, BSCand BL in\\nparticular) continued, and theCabinetbacked off from a confronta\\xad\\ntion with the regional core of the labourmovement - the miners.\\n13. This is no longer the case for all of Tootals- it wasannounced in May\\n1982 that the headquarters of thethreadmaking section had been\\ntransferred , not tosouth-east England but to the United States!\\n14.Itshould be added thatNEI has been trying to diversify, for instance\\nthroughatakeover of Extel (Duffy, 1982).\\n15.Itis not being suggested that these characteristics are universal. There\\nare exceptions even in the \\'traditional sectors\\'. Boswell (1973) reports\\non thecomparative dynamism of small capital in hosiery and knit\\xad\\nwear, for instance (p. 206).\\n16. This is not to imply thatall small firms and self-employment in the\\nSouth East are of the \\'modern\\' variety. Both traditional and modern\\nelements are found in thatregion and there is a distinct division\\nbetween them (Brimson et al.,1981).\\n17. In all the industries discussed here there are also majorcompanies ,\\noftenmultinationals, involved.\\nChapter8: Reflectionson Debates over a Decade\\nI. The degree to which this pointis developed in Spatial Divisions of\\nLabouris limited. Pointers to a way forward have been given in\\nJackson(1991) and Pratt(1991). This is anotherarea of work which\\nhascontinued to develop over the last decade.\\n2. There is a whole range of publications here, the most immediately\\nrelevant to the debateat this point being Warde(1985), Bagguley et al.\\n(1990) and Murgatroyd et al.(1985).\\n3. While on this point,it is relevant to note thatthere is not meant to be\\nin thetheoretical approach ofSpatial Divisions ofLabourany\\nimplication thatlabourisnecessarily always or at any particular\\ntime the most significant factor in capital\\'s search for profitable\\nlocations (see,for a contrary interpretation, Warde, 1985). In the cases\\nanalysed in the preceding chapters labourwas in fact especially\\nsignificant, but this will not necessarily be the case (seefor an analysis\\nwhich brings out otherconsiderations, Morganand Sayer, 1988).\\n4.Conceptualising phenomena in this way also links in to otherdebates\\nwithin the social sciences, for instanceon identity and the constitution\\nof political subjects (Massey, 1994).\\n5. The research reported in Massey, Quintas and Wield (1992) also\\nsupports, again for scientific and associated workers, an increasing\\ndegree of professional isationamongthelattergroup, mostparticularly\\nthroughcredentialism .\\n6. Some of these issues are being approached in an ESRC research\\nproject (no. R000233004): High statusgrowth? Aspects of home and\\nworkaroundhigh-technology sectors. Notes and References 367\\n7.Thanksto Andrew Sayer for raising this issue. To be precise, some\\nreference is made, most especially to systems ofsubcontracting\\nbetween firms, but here again the point is that there are strong\\nelements of real controlthough not exercised throughlegal ownership\\n(adistinction emphasised throughout the book).\\n8.Itisperhapsworth briefly commenting here on Walby and Bagguley,\\n1989. This article aimed to take issue both with Spatial Divisions of\\nLabourand with the work of othersonquestions concerning gender\\nrestructuring .The prime target was critiqueof thetheoryof the reserve\\narmy of labour. Unfortunately , however, the article mistakes the\\nintention of our work. First, its argument generalises from a particular\\nmoment. Second, it is ambivalent as to whether Spatial Divisions of\\nLabourand Massey and Meegan (1982) do or do not employ the\\ntheory of the reserve army of labour. After some twisting and turning\\ntheauthorsdecide that we do but only in a truncated version. The\\ntruthisthatwe do not, though the use of the term \\'reserve\\' must be\\nconfusing on this score. The point, however, is thattheirsubsequent\\ncritique does not apply, and indeed their own statistical analysisof sex\\xad\\ntyping is vulnerable to analysis along spatial-division-of-labour lines\\n(thatis, they assume intrasectoral labour-process similarities between\\nregions). Further, it is a strange assumption thatpatriarchy always\\nleads to closure of occupations to women: it can work in otherways\\n(for instance ghettoisation) .Third,and in a curious reversal ofthe first\\npoint, they write of phenomena which are \\'contingent, thatis,\\ninexplicable\\' (p. 290). As should be clear from all thathas gone\\nbefore,contingency absolutely in no way implies inherent inexplic\\xad\\nability.\\n9. There is a more complex reading which it is possible to make which\\nstresses the historical character ofnatureas well as of the social. But\\nagain, Marx and Engels are ambiguous here, their broadertheoretical\\npropositions not really being rigorously carried throughinto the actual\\nanalyses. Moreover, DonnaHaraway\\'s reading of the same work\\ncomes to the same conclusions as did mine (see below).\\n10. In the same context she also says \\'thisinsight, I will argue here, also\\nforces us to develop analytical perspectives thatarecognizant of\\nagency in human history, and which are, therefore, empowering\\'\\n(p.60).\\nII.See also Massey (1994) and furtherreferences therein.\\n12.

       "   {'translatedText': 'Prefacio a la primera edición Este libro ha tardado mucho tiempo en prepararse. Comenzó como una contribución a un debate dentro de la rama de la geografía conocida como &quot;teoría de la ubicación industrial&quot;, como lo que esperaba que fuera una crítica mordaz de todo, o casi todo, lo que había pasado antes, junto con una segunda mitad que presentaría un &quot;enfoque alternativo&quot;. Varias cosas han sucedido en el período transcurrido desde entonces. Me aburrí con la crítica. El segundo cabello se convirtió en la longitud de un libro en sí mismo, y también cambió su naturaleza. De ser un bosquejo esquemático, se basó cada vez más en lo que estaba sucediendo en Gran Bretaña y en otros países capitalistas avanzados. Pero más que cualquier otra cosa, me convencí cada vez más de la importancia de los temas tratados y del hecho de que deberían tener una audiencia más amplia. Mi objetivo básico había sido vincular la geografía de la industria y el empleo con las estructuras más amplias y subyacentes de la sociedad. Y una de las cosas que hago en el libro es presentar un enfoque que, espero, lo haga posible. La intención inicial, es decir, era partir de las características de la economía y la sociedad, y proceder a explicar su geografía. Pero cuanto más me involucraba en el tema, más me parecía que el proceso no era solo de una vía. También es así: diría que comprender la organización geográfica es fundamental para comprender una economía y una sociedad. La geografía de una sociedad hace una diferencia en la forma en que funciona. Si esto es cierto analíticamente, también lo es políticamente. Para que haya alguna esperanza de alterar la geografía fundamentalmente desigual de la economía y la sociedad británicas (y también la de otros países capitalistas), es necesaria una política que vincule las cuestiones de distribución geográfica con las de organización social y económica. Efectivamente, enfrentar la desigualdad espacial en Gran Bretaña hoy en día significa emprender las mismas batallas, y los mismos estratos sociales, que son necesarios para ganar cualquier cambio progresista más amplio. Pero es igualmente cierto que cualquier estrategia política nacional más amplia debe ser sensible a las variaciones en la estructura económica, en las ocupaciones, en la tradición política y en el tejido de la vida cotidiana que existe entre las diferentes partes del país.
